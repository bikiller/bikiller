The USD/CAD currency pair is trading 0.18% higher, approaching the 1.3700 mark during the European trading session on Monday. This upward movement is primarily driven by weakness in the Canadian Dollar (CAD), which is facing pressure amid thin market liquidity as traders navigate a holiday-shortened week.

The exchange rate has attracted bids below the critical 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.3670, indicating potential bullish momentum. As the market remains subdued, analysts will be closely monitoring how the USD/CAD pair reacts to upcoming economic data releases, which could further influence trading dynamics for both currencies.

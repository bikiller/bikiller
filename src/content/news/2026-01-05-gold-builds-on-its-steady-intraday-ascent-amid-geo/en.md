Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a steady upward movement, climbing to a four-day high around the $4,430-4,431 range during the early European session on Monday. This rise is largely attributed to increasing geopolitical tensions and growing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut, which are both contributing to the metal's appeal as a safe haven.

As traders closely monitor the evolving situation, the exchange rate for gold has shown resilience amid fluctuating market sentiments. The current momentum suggests that the combination of geopolitical risks and anticipated monetary easing by the Fed could further support gold prices, potentially attracting more investment into this precious metal as uncertainty prevails in the forex market.

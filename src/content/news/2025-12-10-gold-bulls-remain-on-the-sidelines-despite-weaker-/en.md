Gold (XAU/USD) continues to trade in a narrow range, hovering just below this week's high as market participants adopt a cautious stance ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The ongoing sideways movement reflects traders' uncertainty, despite the recent weakness of the USD, which typically supports gold prices. 

As the early European session unfolds, the focus shifts to the outcomes of the two-day FOMC policy meeting set to conclude later today. With traders closely monitoring the implications of potential monetary policy shifts, gold bulls remain sidelined, waiting for clearer direction from the Fed. The exchange rate dynamics suggest that further volatility could emerge depending on the central bank's stance on inflation and interest rates.

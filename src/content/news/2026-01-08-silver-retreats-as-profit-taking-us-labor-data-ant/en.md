Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a notable decline on Thursday, trading around $75, down 4.20% for the day. This drop comes amid a relatively calm market but reflects the pressures of profit-taking and anticipation surrounding upcoming US labor data. Traders are closely monitoring these economic indicators, which could further influence the currency pair's exchange rate in the days ahead.

The retreat in silver prices highlights the impact of market sentiment on precious metals, particularly as investors position themselves ahead of key economic reports. As the trading environment shifts, the focus remains on how the labor data will affect the USD's strength against other currencies, including the EUR. Overall, silver's movement today underscores the ongoing volatility in the forex market as participants weigh the implications of macroeconomic developments on their trading strategies.

The USD/JPY currency pair continues to show strong upward momentum, with UOB Group analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann, predicting further gains. The exchange rate has been advancing steadily, and the current momentum suggests the pair could reach the key resistance level of 156.40. Market participants are closely monitoring this potential move as it could signal continued bullish trends for the USD against the JPY.

With the momentum behind the USD/JPY, traders are likely to focus on technical levels and broader market dynamics. If the pair manages to break through the 156.40 resistance, it could pave the way for further gains, potentially pushing the exchange rate to new highs. Market sentiment, driven by the strength of the USD, will be crucial in determining the direction of future trades in this currency pair.

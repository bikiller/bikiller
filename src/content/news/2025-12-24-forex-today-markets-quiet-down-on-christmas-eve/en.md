Markets experienced a lull on Christmas Eve, with currency pairs showing limited movement ahead of the holiday. The EUR/USD exchange rate held steady around 1.1800, reflecting a cautious sentiment among traders. The US dollar maintained its position amid mixed economic data, while the GBP/USD hovered near 1.3400, influenced by ongoing discussions around Brexit.

As liquidity thinned, trading volumes declined significantly, resulting in narrow price fluctuations across major pairs. The USD/JPY remained stable around 113.50, as investors refrained from making bold moves. Overall, the subdued market atmosphere signals a temporary pause in trading activity, with many participants opting to wait for clearer signals in the new year.

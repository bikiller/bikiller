Gold price (XAU/USD) has rebounded to around $4,105, marking a recovery after two consecutive days of declines. This increase is primarily attributed to a softer US Dollar (USD), which has provided a supportive backdrop for the precious metal. The current exchange rate suggests a cautious optimism among traders as they navigate the market in the early European session.

Looking ahead, market participants are keenly awaiting insights from upcoming discussions by Federal Reserve officials. The hawkish stance of the Fed may impose limitations on gold's gains, influencing investor sentiment. As traders adjust their strategies in response to monetary policy signals, the interplay between gold and USD will be crucial for future price movements.

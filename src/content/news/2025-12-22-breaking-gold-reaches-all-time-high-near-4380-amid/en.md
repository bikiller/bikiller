Gold (XAU/USD) surged to an all-time high of approximately $4,380 during the Asian trading session on Monday, driven by increased safe-haven demand. The escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, alongside rising conflicts between the U.S. and Venezuela, have prompted investors to flock to the precious metal, pushing its exchange rate to unprecedented levels.

As geopolitical uncertainties continue to mount, traders are likely to keep a close eye on gold's performance. The strong demand for this safe-haven asset may influence other currency pairs, particularly the USD and EUR, as investors seek stability in their portfolios amidst turbulent market conditions. Analysts predict that if current trends persist, gold could maintain its upward trajectory, offering further implications for forex trading strategies.

The NZD/USD currency pair hovered near 0.6050 on Friday, after briefly touching 0.6057, its strongest level in two weeks. The New Zealand Dollar’s modest advance reflected cautious trading conditions as investors positioned ahead of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s February 18 Monetary Policy Statement. Momentum, however, appeared to fade as the exchange rate struggled to extend gains beyond recent highs.

Market participants are closely evaluating the RBNZ’s policy outlook, weighing whether policymakers will maintain a firm stance or signal flexibility in response to moderating inflation pressures. Expectations around interest rates have underpinned the kiwi in recent sessions, even as broader USD movements remain driven by shifting Federal Reserve rate projections and US data surprises.

While the pair’s rebound suggests improving near-term sentiment, technical traction above 0.6057 remains limited, keeping the focus on whether buyers can sustain control. A decisive move higher could open the door to further upside, whereas renewed USD strength or cautious RBNZ guidance may cap gains and pull NZD/USD back toward the 0.6000 threshold.

ICE Brent crude oil prices rose nearly 1.2% last week, buoyed by a surge on Friday following a Ukrainian attack on the Russian port of Novorossiysk. The resurgence in oil shipments from the port is likely to have significant implications for global oil supply dynamics, especially as tensions continue to influence trading patterns in the energy sector.

As traders monitor the ongoing developments, fluctuations in oil prices could impact currency pairs such as USD/EUR and USD/RUB, as changes in energy prices often correlate with shifts in exchange rates. Investors are keenly observing these movements, as they can signal broader market trends and affect economic forecasts for oil-dependent economies.

Gold (XAU/USD) has maintained its upward momentum, hovering near a two-week high, following a surge during the Asian trading session on Wednesday. Currently, the precious metal is benefiting from a weaker US dollar as traders adjust their expectations surrounding potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This shift in sentiment has driven the exchange rate, pushing gold towards further gains.

As the market reacts to the dovish outlook from the Fed, the USD has experienced a notable decline, fostering an environment conducive for gold's appreciation. Analysts predict that continued speculation regarding interest rate reductions could keep the XAU/USD pair well-supported, potentially leading to even higher price levels in the near term.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures on the NYMEX have dipped 0.4%, approaching the $57.00 mark in late Asian trading on Monday. This decline comes as the U.S. government commits to enhancing Venezuela's oil infrastructure, potentially increasing supply in the global market. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as they could influence the exchange rate dynamics of oil-related currencies.

As WTI prices hover near critical levels, market participants remain cautious. The ongoing fluctuations in oil prices often correlate with movements in the USD, impacting various currency pairs. The commitment to Venezuela's oil sector may shift investor sentiment, potentially strengthening the USD against the EUR in the coming sessions. With geopolitical factors at play, traders will need to stay alert to further news that could affect WTI pricing and the broader forex landscape.

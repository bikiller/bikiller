The NZD/USD currency pair extends its recovery and trades firmly above the 0.6000 psychological level, hovering near 0.6025 during the early Asian trading session on Monday. The exchange rate reflects renewed demand for the New Zealand Dollar, as traders respond to improved risk sentiment following the latest Chinese Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data.

The PMI release from China, New Zealand’s largest trading partner, provided support for commodity-linked currencies and boosted NZD trading against the USD. Signs of stabilization in Chinese manufacturing activity encouraged investors to rotate away from the US Dollar and into higher-yielding currencies, lifting the NZD/USD pair and reinforcing short-term bullish momentum in the forex market.

Holding above 0.6000 keeps the technical outlook constructive, with traders watching whether the currency pair can sustain gains above the 0.6025 area. Continued strength could open the door for further upside, while any deterioration in global growth sentiment may revive USD demand. Market participants will also monitor broader USD moves across major pairs, including EUR/USD, for confirmation of trend direction.

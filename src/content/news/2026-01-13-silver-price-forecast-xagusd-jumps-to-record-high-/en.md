Silver prices surged on Tuesday, with the XAG/USD currency pair climbing 2% and reaching an all-time high of $89.11. This impressive rally came as the US dollar strengthened following a softer-than-expected inflation report, signaling potential easing in monetary policy. At the time of writing, XAG/USD was trading at $86.91, recovering from daily lows of $83.45.

The bullish momentum in silver reflects increased investor interest, driven by ongoing economic uncertainties. As the exchange rate fluctuates, traders remain cautious, closely monitoring inflation trends and their impact on the USD. With silver breaking new ground, the market is eager to see if this trend will continue or if profit-taking will influence future price movements.

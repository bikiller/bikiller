The USD/CHF currency pair is showing signs of vulnerability, trading around the 0.7950 level during Friday's European session. This dip reflects mounting pressure on the USD as traders anticipate multiple interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in 2026, which could further impact the exchange rate. 

As market sentiment shifts, the Swiss Franc continues to gain traction, offering a safe-haven alternative amid growing concerns about U.S. monetary policy. With expectations of at least two rate cuts on the horizon, the outlook for the USD remains uncertain, suggesting potential volatility for the USD/CHF pair in the coming months.

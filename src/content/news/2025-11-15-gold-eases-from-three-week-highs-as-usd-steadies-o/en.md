Gold (XAU/USD) retreated from three-week highs on Friday, as bullish momentum faltered in the face of mixed market sentiment. Currently trading around $4,100, gold has seen a decline of nearly 1.5%, following a dip to $4,032 earlier in the day. The stabilization of the USD has contributed to the precious metal's pullback, as traders remain cautious amid uncertainties surrounding the Federal Reserve's outlook.

The exchange rate fluctuations reflect broader market dynamics, with investors weighing potential moves from the Fed against shifting economic indicators. As the USD steadies, gold's appeal as a safe haven diminishes, prompting traders to reassess their positions. This market movement underscores the delicate balance between currency strength and commodity prices, which may continue to influence trading strategies in the near term.

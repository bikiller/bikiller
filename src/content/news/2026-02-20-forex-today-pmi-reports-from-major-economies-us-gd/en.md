Friday’s forex market sees heightened volatility as key economic data rolls in. PMI reports from major economies, including the Eurozone, UK, and US, will likely shape trading today, with market participants looking to gauge economic health. The EUR/USD pair is trading around 1.0650, edging lower as market sentiment remains cautious ahead of these reports. Similarly, GBP/USD is hovering near 1.2000, showing slight weakness.

US GDP data, due later in the session, could add further fuel to the movement. A strong reading could boost the USD, propelling USD/JPY higher from its current range near 134.50, while a weaker print might trigger a pullback. The dollar’s movements will be pivotal for traders, particularly as the greenback’s strength or weakness directly impacts other major pairs. All eyes remain on how these data releases will affect broader market sentiment and volatility across currency pairs.

Silver (XAG/USD) is trading higher on Wednesday, reaching around $114, marking a 1.80% gain for the day. The precious metal continues to benefit from strong safe-haven demand as global market risk sentiment remains subdued. Investors are seeking refuge in silver amid heightened uncertainties, with the broader market showing signs of volatility.

The ongoing weakness of the US Dollar (USD) has provided further support to silver prices. As the USD struggles to gain momentum, demand for alternative assets like silver remains robust. The market is also closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's policy stance, which continues to influence investor sentiment and broader market trends.

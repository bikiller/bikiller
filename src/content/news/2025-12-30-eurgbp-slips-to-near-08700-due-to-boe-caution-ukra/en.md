EUR/GBP has continued its downward trend, slipping to around 0.8710 during Tuesday's European trading session, marking a second consecutive day of losses. The exchange rate reflects a cautious sentiment from the Bank of England (BoE) amid ongoing geopolitical tensions related to the Ukraine-Russia conflict. 

Market activity is expected to remain subdued as traders navigate thin volumes associated with the year-end holiday period. The uncertainty surrounding the peace process in Ukraine is contributing to the volatility in the currency pair, prompting traders to remain vigilant as they assess potential impacts on the broader forex market.

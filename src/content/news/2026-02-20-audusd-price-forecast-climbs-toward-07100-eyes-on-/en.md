The AUD/USD continues its upward momentum, rising 0.36% on the second consecutive day of gains. The Greenback is weakening as US economic growth faces pressure, while inflation trends towards 3%. The pair is currently trading at 0.7086, and it is on track to finish the week with a modest gain of 0.19%.

Market sentiment is shifting as traders monitor US economic data and the potential for further inflationary pressures. The focus now turns to the 0.7100 resistance level, with the currency pair eyeing the year-to-date high. If the Australian Dollar continues its ascent, it may see further support, especially if the USD remains under pressure in the coming sessions.

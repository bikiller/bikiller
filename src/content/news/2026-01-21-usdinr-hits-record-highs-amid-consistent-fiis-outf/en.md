The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced significant depreciation against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, hitting record lows as the USD/INR exchange rate climbed to new heights. This decline can be attributed to a persistent outflow of foreign institutional investments (FIIs), which has put additional pressure on the rupee. As sentiment in the market shifts, the trading dynamics are increasingly influenced by these capital movements, leading to heightened volatility.

Analysts note that the continued FII outflows reflect broader concerns over economic stability and domestic market conditions. Investors are reacting to a combination of global economic factors and local developments, prompting a reevaluation of risk. The current situation raises questions about the rupee's resilience and the potential for further depreciation if the outflows persist, underlining the complexities in the currency pair's performance within the forex market.

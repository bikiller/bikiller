The EUR/GBP currency pair continues to face downward pressure, trading in negative territory for the fourth consecutive day. As of the early European session on Tuesday, the exchange rate has dipped below the key level of 0.8750, currently hovering around 0.8730. This decline comes as the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data matched forecasts, failing to provide a boost to the British pound.

The sustained weakness in the EUR/GBP reflects broader market sentiment as traders react to economic indicators. With the euro under pressure against the pound, traders are closely monitoring technical levels to gauge potential support. As the session unfolds, the focus will remain on how these economic signals may influence future trading strategies in this currency pair.

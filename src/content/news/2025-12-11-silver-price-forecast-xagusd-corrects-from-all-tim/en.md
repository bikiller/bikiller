Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a notable correction during the Asian trading session on Thursday, pulling back to around $62.00 after reaching a new all-time high of $62.87 earlier in the day. This retracement highlights the volatile nature of the silver market, as traders react to shifting demand dynamics and external market factors.

Despite the pullback, the outlook for silver remains robust, fueled by ongoing investor interest in precious metals as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations. As the USD continues to face pressure, the exchange rate for silver could see further fluctuations, making it a key currency pair to watch in the coming sessions.

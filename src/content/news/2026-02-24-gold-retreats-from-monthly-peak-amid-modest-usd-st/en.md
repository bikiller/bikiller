Gold (XAU/USD) pulled back from a fresh monthly high of $5,250 during the Asian session, ending a four-day winning streak. The retreat came amid modest strength in the US Dollar (USD), as the greenback gained traction against major currencies. Gold’s inability to hold above the $5,250 mark suggests the market remains hesitant despite recent gains.

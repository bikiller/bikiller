The USD/INR currency pair experienced a notable recovery on Friday, climbing to approximately 90.25 as the market reacted to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent dovish monetary policy announcement. This shift in stance from the RBI, coupled with an upgrade in growth forecasts, has led to increased selling pressure on the Indian Rupee (INR) against the US Dollar (USD).

Traders are now closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics, as the dovish outlook from the RBI signals a continuation of accommodative measures, which could weigh on the INR in the near term. The market's response hints at a potential shift in trading strategies, with investors reassessing their positions in light of the central bank's policy direction and its implications for future currency fluctuations.

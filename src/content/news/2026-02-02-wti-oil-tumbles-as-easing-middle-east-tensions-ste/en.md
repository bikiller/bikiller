WTI oil prices dropped 5.50% on Monday, trading around $61.90 as easing tensions between the United States and Iran weighed on the market. With the potential for reduced geopolitical risks, supply expectations shifted, leading to pressure on crude prices. The softening of Middle East tensions suggests fewer disruptions to global oil supply, further undermining bullish sentiment.

This decline in WTI also reflects steady OPEC+ output, as the group maintains its production targets. The steady supply backdrop, combined with global economic concerns, keeps oil prices vulnerable. As the market adjusts to these factors, traders remain cautious, impacting currency pairs like USD/JPY and EUR/USD, which often mirror risk sentiment tied to oil market movements.

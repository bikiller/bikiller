The EUR/USD currency pair continues to decline, marking its sixth consecutive day of losses as it trades below the 1.1730 level. This downward trend follows a peak above 1.1800 last week, highlighting a significant reversal in momentum. The current exchange rate reflects the pair's struggle against a strengthening US Dollar, which is gaining traction in year-end trading.

The recent rebound in USD is attributed to the release of the Federal Reserve's December Monetary Policy Meeting minutes, which hinted at a more hawkish stance. As traders digest this information, the implications for the EUR/USD exchange rate become clear. The pressure on the euro is mounting, and further declines could be anticipated if the USD maintains its strength in the face of economic developments.

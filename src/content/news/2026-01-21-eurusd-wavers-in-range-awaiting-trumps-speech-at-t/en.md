The EUR/USD currency pair is currently trading at 1.1728, showing moderate gains on the daily chart. This position places it near the three-week high of 1.1765 reached earlier this week, indicating a period of consolidation as traders await key developments. The market remains poised for potential volatility with President Trump's upcoming speech at the Davos forum.

As the exchange rate fluctuates within this range, market participants are closely monitoring geopolitical signals and economic commentary that could influence the USD's strength. A decisive move could shape the trading landscape for the euro and impact investor sentiment in the near term.

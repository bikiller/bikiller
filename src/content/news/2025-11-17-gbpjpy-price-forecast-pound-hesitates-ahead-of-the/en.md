The GBP/JPY currency pair saw a moderate appreciation on Monday, as the Pound rebounded from Friday’s lows to settle within the upper range of the 203-00s. The exchange rate is currently facing significant resistance between 204.05 and 204.25, indicated by the long wicks on the daily chart, which reflect traders' hesitation as they eye the pivotal 204.00 level.

This resistance area could present challenges for further upside movement. Should the Pound manage to break through this threshold, it may signal a stronger bullish momentum. Conversely, failure to surpass these levels could lead to a retracement, prompting traders to reassess their positions in this dynamic market environment.

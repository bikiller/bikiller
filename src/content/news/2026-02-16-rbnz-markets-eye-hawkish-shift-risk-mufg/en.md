The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to leave its Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged at 5.5% during its February 18 meeting, signaling that November's rate cut was the last in the current cycle. This comes as markets anticipate a more dovish stance, leading to minimal impact on NZD/USD in the short term, with the currency pair currently holding steady around the 0.6250 mark.

Despite the RBNZ's steady outlook, analysts remain cautious of potential hawkish shifts later in the year. MUFG’s Lee Hardman highlighted that any unexpected shifts in the bank's stance could trigger volatility in the NZD, especially against key pairs like EUR/NZD. Traders will be closely monitoring any subtle signals for clues about future monetary policy direction and its impact on New Zealand’s exchange rate performance.

The EUR/CHF currency pair is currently trading near a three-month high as it hovers around 0.9650, reflecting a robust position for the Euro against the Swiss Franc. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as they anticipate the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) upcoming monetary policy announcement on Thursday, which could have significant implications for the Franc's value.

The sustained pressure on the CHF can be attributed to prevailing market sentiment and expectations of the SNB's policy direction. As the Euro faces only modest resistance, the potential for further gains in the EUR/CHF pair remains on the table, depending on the SNB’s decision and its impact on the broader forex market.

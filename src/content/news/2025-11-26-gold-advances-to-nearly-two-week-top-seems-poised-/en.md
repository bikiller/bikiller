Gold (XAU/USD) has surged to a fresh one-and-a-half-week high, surpassing the $4,160 mark during the Asian session on Wednesday. This upward movement follows a volatile trading session, where the precious metal found new buying interest amid growing expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. 

As market participants weigh the implications of potential shifts in U.S. monetary policy, gold's positive momentum reflects increased demand for safe-haven assets. The climb above key technical levels indicates strong bullish sentiment, positioning gold for further gains as traders continue to monitor the Fed's actions and statements closely.

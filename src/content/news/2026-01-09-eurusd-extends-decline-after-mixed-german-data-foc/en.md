The EUR/USD currency pair continues to face downward pressure, trading at a monthly low of 1.1640. This decline marks a 0.6% depreciation for the week, driven by mixed economic data from Germany and heightened anticipation surrounding the upcoming U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report.

As traders react to the fluctuating exchange rate, the German data has contributed to uncertainty in the eurozone, while market participants remain focused on how U.S. employment figures might influence the USD. The interplay between these economic indicators underscores the ongoing volatility in the forex market, with potential implications for future trading strategies in the EUR/USD pair.

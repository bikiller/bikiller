The US Dollar (USD) regained momentum on Monday, recovering from early losses and maintaining a steady trading range. Despite initial concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs, the greenback found stability as markets absorbed the Supreme Court's decision to block Trump's proposed additional tariffs. The EUR/USD traded at 1.1765, with resistance near 1.1800, while the USD/JPY remained largely unchanged around 111.50.

Gold saw a modest rebound amid ongoing uncertainty regarding trade tensions. The yellow metal traded near $1,285 per ounce, as investors sought safe-haven assets in response to Trump's weekend tariff announcements. With US-China trade relations still a key concern, market participants are closely monitoring any new developments that could influence currency pairs, including USD/CHF and AUD/USD, as global risks remain elevated.

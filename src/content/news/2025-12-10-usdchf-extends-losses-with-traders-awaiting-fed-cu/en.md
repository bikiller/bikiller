The Swiss Franc (CHF) is showing resilience against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, as the USD/CHF currency pair extends its losses for a second consecutive day. Currently trading lower, the exchange rate reflects a broader market sentiment influenced by traders positioning ahead of the Federal Reserve's impending interest rate decision scheduled for 19:00 GMT. 

As the Greenback remains under pressure, the focus shifts to upcoming guidance from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which could further impact market dynamics. This cautious trading atmosphere may lead to increased volatility in forex markets, particularly for the USD and its related pairs, as investors await clarity on future monetary policy.

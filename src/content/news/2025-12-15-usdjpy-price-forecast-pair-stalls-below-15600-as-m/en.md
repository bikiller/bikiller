The USD/JPY currency pair is currently stalling below the 156.00 mark as bullish momentum begins to wane. On Monday, the Japanese Yen (JPY) is gaining ground against the US Dollar (USD), influenced by strong market anticipation for an interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) at its upcoming monetary policy meeting on December 19.

As traders keep a close eye on these developments, the exchange rate reflects this sentiment, with the JPY benefiting from expectations that increased rates could bolster the currency. The market's focus remains on how this potential shift in monetary policy will impact the overall trading landscape, particularly in the context of the ongoing strength of the USD.

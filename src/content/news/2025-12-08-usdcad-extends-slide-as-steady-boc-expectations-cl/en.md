The Canadian Dollar (CAD) continued its upward momentum against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, as the USD/CAD exchange rate showcases the impact of diverging monetary policy expectations. Investors are gravitating towards the Loonie amid steady forecasts for the Bank of Canada (BoC), which is anticipated to maintain its current policy stance, contrasting with growing bets for easing measures from the Federal Reserve (Fed).

As a result, the USD/CAD pair has shown a noticeable decline, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. The exchange rate has dipped, underscoring a preference for the CAD in a trading environment where central bank strategies are key. This divergence could lead to sustained fluctuations in the currency pair as traders monitor economic indicators and policy decisions from both the BoC and Fed in the coming weeks.

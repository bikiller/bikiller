The GBP/USD currency pair has strengthened to approximately 1.3480 during the early Asian session on Friday, buoyed by expectations of imminent rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve. This sentiment has put downward pressure on the US Dollar, allowing the Pound Sterling to gain traction. The anticipation surrounding potential adjustments in monetary policy is influencing trader sentiment and exchange rate dynamics.

As the market eyes Philadelphia Fed President Anna Paulson's speech later this weekend, traders remain vigilant for insights that may further shape Fed policy.

The USD/CAD currency pair saw a modest rebound during the Asian session on Thursday, currently trading above the mid-1.3900s. This movement comes after the pair experienced a two-day losing streak, with prices hovering around the 1.3940-1.3935 level, which marks a nearly one-month low reached last week. 

Despite attracting some buying interest, analysts suggest that the upside potential for the USD/CAD may be limited. Traders are closely monitoring market dynamics and external factors that could influence the exchange rate, as the pair continues to navigate a precarious balance in the current trading environment.

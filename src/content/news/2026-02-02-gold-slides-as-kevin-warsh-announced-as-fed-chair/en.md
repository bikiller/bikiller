Gold prices slid sharply at the start of the week, with XAU/USD dropping to a two-week low below $4,700 during Asian trading on Monday. The move followed the announcement of Kevin Warsh as the new Federal Reserve chair, triggering profit-taking after recent gains. The stronger USD weighed on the gold exchange rate, pressuring bullion across early trading sessions.

Market participants interpreted the leadership change at the Fed as potentially more hawkish for monetary policy, lifting US Treasury yields and supporting the greenback. As the USD firmed against major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD, demand for non-yielding assets like gold weakened. Traders reduced long positions, accelerating the decline toward key technical support levels.

The pullback in gold highlights the sensitivity of precious metals to shifts in Fed expectations and currency market dynamics. If USD strength persists and risk appetite improves, XAU/USD could remain under pressure in the near term. However, ongoing uncertainty around inflation, interest rates, and global growth may limit downside risks and keep gold relevant for diversification in forex trading strategies.

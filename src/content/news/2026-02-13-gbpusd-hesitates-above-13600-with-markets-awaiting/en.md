The GBP/USD currency pair is facing pressure, holding just above the 1.3600 level as markets await key US inflation data. The Pound has now extended its losses for the fourth consecutive day, pulling back from a weekly high of 1.3700. This move reflects ongoing caution among traders, with the upcoming US inflation report expected to significantly impact the USD's strength.

The exchange rate for GBP/USD has struggled to maintain upward momentum, as market sentiment remains cautious ahead of US economic data. A potential shift in the USD’s direction could result from stronger-than-expected inflation figures, influencing the Federal Reserve's next steps. Traders are closely watching for signs of volatility, with the 1.3600 level serving as an immediate support point.

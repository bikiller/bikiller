The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues its sideways movement against major currencies as traders await the Federal Reserve's crucial rate decision on Wednesday. As the early European session unfolds, JPY exhibits a slight bullish bias, maintaining its position near significant technical levels. The current exchange rate reflects a cautious optimism among Yen bulls, who are closely monitoring market sentiments ahead of the Fed's announcement.

Market participants are weighing the potential implications of the Fed's decision on the USD/JPY currency pair. Speculation around interest rate changes adds to the volatility, influencing trading strategies for both bulls and bears. With the exchange rate hovering around key support and resistance levels, traders are poised for potential shifts that could define the Yen's trajectory in the coming days. Investors remain alert as the outcome of the Fed’s meeting could lead to heightened trading activity across the forex market.

AUD/USD is trading at approximately 0.6680, reflecting a 0.40% increase for the day. The pair reached a three-month high of 0.6700 earlier but has since pulled back. This retracement can be attributed to stronger-than-expected US economic data, which bolstered the US Dollar and capped potential gains for the Australian currency.

The release of positive US economic indicators has shifted market sentiment, providing fresh support to the USD and limiting the upside for AUD/USD. As traders assess the implications of the US data, the exchange rate remains sensitive to further developments, with potential volatility ahead as market participants weigh the impact of economic trends on the currency pair's performance.

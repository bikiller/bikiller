The USD/MXN currency pair has continued its downward trajectory after failing to maintain levels above the 50-day moving average. This technical rejection has prompted the exchange rate to test critical support around the 17.85 to 17.80 range, reflecting a bearish sentiment among traders. 

Market participants are closely monitoring this support level, as a sustained breach could signal further declines for the USD against the MXN. The movement follows broader trends in the forex market, influenced by economic data and monetary policy expectations, underscoring the ongoing volatility in currency trading.

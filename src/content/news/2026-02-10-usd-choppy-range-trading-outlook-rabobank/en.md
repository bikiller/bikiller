The USD has been trading in a choppy range following reports suggesting that Chinese regulators have urged local institutions to reduce their holdings of US Treasuries. This news has fueled renewed concerns over potential USD debasement, causing the currency to weaken. As a result, the EUR/USD exchange rate saw a slight uptick, reaching 1.0900, while other dollar pairs also saw muted movement. 

Market sentiment remains uncertain as traders digest the implications of these developments. The USD is currently facing resistance at 1.0950 against the euro, with a potential pullback in focus if further signs of weakness emerge. In the meantime, the broader forex market remains sensitive to shifts in US Treasury yields and ongoing geopolitical concerns, keeping volatility levels elevated for the foreseeable future.

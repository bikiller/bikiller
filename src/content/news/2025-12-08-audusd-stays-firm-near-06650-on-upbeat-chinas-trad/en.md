The AUD/USD pair continues to show resilience, trading close to 0.6650 amid positive economic signals from China. This marks the 12th consecutive day of gains for the Australian dollar, buoyed by an upbeat Trade Balance report from China that has bolstered market sentiment. The currency pair is hovering near its highest level in over two months, reflecting a strong trend in the forex market.

Market participants are closely monitoring the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy stance as it may influence future movements in the exchange rate. As the Australian dollar gains traction against the USD, traders are assessing how RBA decisions could affect the currency pair's trajectory in the coming days. The interplay between commodities, global economic data, and central bank policies remains critical in shaping the AUD/USD outlook.

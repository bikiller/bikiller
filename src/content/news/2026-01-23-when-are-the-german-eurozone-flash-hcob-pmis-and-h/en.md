The preliminary German and Eurozone flash HCOB Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for January will be released today at 08:30 and 09:00 GMT, respectively. The reports are expected to provide insights into economic activity in both regions, potentially influencing the EUR/USD exchange rate. A stronger-than-expected PMI could support the euro, pushing the currency pair higher, while a weaker figure could fuel downside pressure on the euro, sending EUR/USD lower.

Market participants will be closely watching these figures for signs of growth or contraction in Germany and the broader Eurozone. If the data comes in weaker than expected, the euro could face headwinds, particularly against the USD, which has been buoyed by the US Federal Reserve's hawkish stance. EUR/USD traders will need to assess how the PMI numbers align with broader economic trends, as this could impact the pair's next technical move, potentially testing key support or resistance levels.

EUR/USD dipped below the 1.18 mark following the release of the January Federal Reserve minutes, which were perceived as more hawkish. Stronger-than-expected U.S. labor data contributed to the shift in market sentiment, reinforcing expectations that the Fed will maintain its cautious approach. As a result, traders adjusted their positions, moving away from the previous outlook of aggressive rate cuts.

With the latest data, the prospect of a rate cut in March has been effectively ruled out. Markets have also reduced their expectations for rate cuts in 2026, now pricing in fewer than two. This shift is likely to support a cautious upside for the USD in the near term, with the currency pair continuing to be influenced by Fed policy signals and U.S. economic performance.

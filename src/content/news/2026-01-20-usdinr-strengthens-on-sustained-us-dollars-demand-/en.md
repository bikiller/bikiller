The Indian Rupee (INR) faced continued pressure against the US Dollar (USD), marking its fourth consecutive day of losses. On Tuesday, the USD/INR exchange rate saw a notable increase, driven by sustained demand for the US dollar from Indian importers. This demand reflects ongoing concerns about rising import costs and the overall strength of the greenback in global markets.

As the currency pair traded lower, market participants closely monitored technical levels to gauge potential support and resistance. The persistent weakness of the INR highlights the impact of external factors, including fluctuations in oil prices and India's trade deficit. Traders now anticipate how these dynamics will influence future trading sessions, particularly as the USD maintains its robust position against major currencies like the Euro (EUR).

Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a notable rebound, rising over 2% to around $74.40 per troy ounce during early European trading on Tuesday. This recovery comes after a sharp decline of more than 7% in the previous session, highlighting the volatile nature of the precious metal market. The currency pair's movement reflects a broader market sentiment, influenced by shifts in the USD and global economic indicators.

Traders are closely monitoring the overbought zone, as the recent surge raises questions about sustainability. With the exchange rate hovering near this technical level, market participants will be looking for signals that could indicate a potential reversal or continuation of this upward trend. The fluctuation in silver prices also underscores the ongoing interplay between safe-haven assets and risk sentiment in the forex market, particularly as investors navigate uncertainties in other currency pairs like EUR/USD.

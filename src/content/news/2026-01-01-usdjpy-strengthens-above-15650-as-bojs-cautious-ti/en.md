The USD/JPY currency pair surged above the 156.50 mark, reaching approximately 156.75 during the early Asian trading session on Monday. This upward movement reflects a growing weakness in the Japanese Yen (JPY) as traders express disappointment over the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) gradual approach to monetary tightening, which has failed to provide the anticipated support for the JPY.

As the BoJ maintains a cautious stance on interest rate adjustments, the exchange rate dynamics have shifted in favor of the US Dollar (USD). With traders closely monitoring the central bank's next moves, the USD continues to capitalize on the JPY’s vulnerability, highlighting the ongoing impact of monetary policy on currency market fluctuations.

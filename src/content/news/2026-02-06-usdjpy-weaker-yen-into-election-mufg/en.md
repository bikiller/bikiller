The Japanese Yen remains under pressure against the U.S. Dollar ahead of Japan's Lower House election, according to MUFG's Lee Hardman. The USD/JPY exchange rate continues to reflect a weaker Yen, with investors maintaining short positions. Despite some market moves in other currency pairs, JPY shorts have yet to experience the broad liquidation seen in other trades, highlighting ongoing yen weakness.

This persistent weakness in the Yen is fueling concerns over potential volatility in the forex market, as the election could influence Japan's economic outlook. The continued dominance of the Dollar adds to the pressure, with USD/JPY trading near key technical levels. Traders are closely watching these dynamics, anticipating shifts in market sentiment depending on the election's outcome.

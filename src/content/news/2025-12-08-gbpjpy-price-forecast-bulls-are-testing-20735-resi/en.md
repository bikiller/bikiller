The GBP/JPY currency pair is experiencing upward momentum as the Pound starts the week positively, while the Japanese Yen weakens across the board. After bouncing off the 206.20 level on Friday, bulls are now eyeing the critical resistance area at 207.35, which represents a 17-month high. This shift in the exchange rate reflects a broader positive sentiment in the market.

The current bullish trend for the Pound is supported by favorable fundamental conditions, boosting traders' confidence. As the market continues to react to various economic indicators, the focus will remain on whether the GBP can maintain this upward trajectory against the Yen. If the resistance at 207.35 is breached, it could signal further gains for the Pound in the near term.

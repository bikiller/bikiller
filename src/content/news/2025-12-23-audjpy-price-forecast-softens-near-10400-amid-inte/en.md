The AUD/JPY currency pair faced selling pressure near the 104.05 level during the early European session on Tuesday, as traders reacted to rising intervention fears surrounding the Japanese Yen. This shift in market sentiment reflects the Yen's strengthening against the Australian Dollar, affecting the exchange rate dynamics significantly.

Despite the pullback, the broader uptrend for AUD/JPY remains intact. Market participants are closely monitoring the potential implications of intervention measures, which could influence future trading patterns. As volatility persists, the focus will likely remain on key technical levels and broader economic indicators impacting both currencies.

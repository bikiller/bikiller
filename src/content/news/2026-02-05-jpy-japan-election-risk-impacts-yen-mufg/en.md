The Japanese Yen has come under pressure as election risk weighs on the market. The USD/JPY currency pair has surged above the 157.00 level, fueled by growing expectations that Japan's ruling coalition will strengthen its majority in the upcoming elections. This sentiment shift has led to increased demand for the U.S. dollar, with traders positioning for potential political stability in Japan.

As the market reacts to the election developments, the USD/JPY has seen upward momentum, reflecting the broader market's confidence in the ruling coalition’s prospects. The rise above 157.00 marks a key technical level, signaling further strength for the greenback. Investors will closely monitor the outcome of Japan’s elections, as any surprises could lead to volatility in the exchange rate.

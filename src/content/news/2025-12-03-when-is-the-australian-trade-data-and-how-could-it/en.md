The Australian Bureau of Statistics is set to release the trade data for August on Thursday at 00:30 GMT. Analysts anticipate that the trade surplus will expand to 4,200 million AUD, up from the previous figure of 3,938 million. This increase could bolster the Australian dollar (AUD) against the US dollar (USD), potentially impacting the AUD/USD currency pair as traders react to the improved economic outlook.

An unexpected surge in the trade surplus may strengthen the AUD, influencing market sentiment and pushing the AUD/USD exchange rate higher. This data release comes amidst a backdrop of fluctuating global economic conditions, making it crucial for traders to monitor the implications on the currency pair's technical levels and overall trading strategies in the forex market.

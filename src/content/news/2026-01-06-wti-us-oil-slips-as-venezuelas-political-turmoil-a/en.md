West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is currently trading at approximately $57.50, reflecting a decline of 1.25% on the day. This drop is primarily attributed to growing concerns over the political instability in Venezuela, which could significantly impact global oil supply. Traders are closely monitoring the situation, as any disruption in Venezuelan production could have repercussions for oil prices worldwide.

Additionally, the market is awaiting the American Petroleum Institute (API) inventory report, which could further influence the WTI price trajectory. With the exchange rate of the USD remaining a critical factor, fluctuations in oil prices may also impact currency pair dynamics, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies. As traders assess the implications of Venezuela's turmoil alongside inventory data, market volatility is likely to persist.

EUR/USD is currently testing two-and-a-half-month highs at 1.1765 as traders position themselves ahead of the important US employment and consumption data due for release. This movement has occurred despite the recent disappointing preliminary Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs), which typically impact market sentiment negatively.

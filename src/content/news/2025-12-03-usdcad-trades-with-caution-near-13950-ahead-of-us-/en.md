The USD/CAD currency pair is trading cautiously around the 1.3960 mark during the European session on Wednesday. Market participants are closely monitoring upcoming U.S. employment and Services PMI data, which could influence the exchange rate significantly. The uncertainty surrounding these economic indicators has led to a subdued trading environment.

As traders await the data releases, the current price action reflects a wait-and-see approach. Should the U.S. employment figures and Services PMI outperform expectations, the USD may strengthen against the CAD, pushing the exchange rate higher. Conversely, disappointing data could lead to a pullback, resulting in a potential drop below the key 1.3950 level.

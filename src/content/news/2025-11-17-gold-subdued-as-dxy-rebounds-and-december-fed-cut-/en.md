Gold (XAU/USD) opened the week in a subdued manner, continuing its consolidation after a two-day decline. This follows a brief rally that pushed prices above a three-week high, but recent market dynamics have shifted sentiment. As the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rebounded, gold's appeal faced pressure, leading to a drop in demand for the precious metal.

The fading expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December have further contributed to gold's weakness. As traders reassess their positions amid a strengthened USD, gold is likely to remain under pressure, with prices hovering around critical technical levels. This shift in market sentiment underscores the ongoing volatility in the forex landscape, particularly affecting the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other major currencies such as the EUR.

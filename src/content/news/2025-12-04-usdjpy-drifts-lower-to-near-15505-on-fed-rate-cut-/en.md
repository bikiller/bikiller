The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing downward pressure, trading around 155.05 during the early Asian session on Friday. This decline is fueled by increasing expectations for a potential rate cut by the US Federal Reserve in the coming week, as well as disappointing economic data from the United States. The bearish sentiment on the US dollar continues to affect its exchange rate against the Japanese yen.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming US PCE inflation data, which could provide further insights into the Fed's monetary policy direction. As traders adjust their positions in anticipation of this key economic release, the USD/JPY pair may remain volatile, reflecting broader market sentiments regarding US economic health and interest rate outlook.

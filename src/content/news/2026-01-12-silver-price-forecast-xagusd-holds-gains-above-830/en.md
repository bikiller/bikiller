Silver prices (XAG/USD) continue to rise, maintaining support above $83.00, currently trading at approximately $83.10 per troy ounce during Monday's Asian session. The precious metal's upward momentum marks the second consecutive day of gains, driven by a surge in safe-haven demand as global geopolitical tensions escalate. 

This increased interest in silver reflects broader market sentiment, with traders flocking to safer assets amid uncertainty. As the XAG/USD currency pair strengthens, it highlights the ongoing appeal of precious metals in times of instability, suggesting that the upward trend may persist if geopolitical concerns remain unresolved.

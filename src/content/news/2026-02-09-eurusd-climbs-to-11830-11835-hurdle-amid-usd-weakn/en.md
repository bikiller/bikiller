The EUR/USD pair is gaining momentum, trading near the 1.1830-1.1835 resistance level amid ongoing weakness in the USD. After a solid rebound from the 1.1765 support region, which marked a two-week low, the pair is posting positive gains for the second consecutive day. The shift in sentiment follows a broad decline in the US dollar across the market.

Traders are now turning their attention to the delayed Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) data, expected to provide further insights into the US labor market and potential policy adjustments from the Federal Reserve. This upcoming economic release could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate in the coming days, with the pair looking to break through the 1.1835 level for more upside momentum.

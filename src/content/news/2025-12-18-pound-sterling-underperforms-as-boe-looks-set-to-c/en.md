The Pound Sterling (GBP) is trading lower against its major peers on Thursday, with the exchange rate reflecting growing concerns ahead of the Bank of England's (BoE) imminent interest rate decision at 12:00 GMT. As traders position themselves for potential monetary easing, the GBP/USD pair has dipped to 1.2200, while GBP/EUR is seen trading around 1.1550, indicating a bearish sentiment in the market.

Market speculations suggest that the BoE may cut interest rates to stimulate the economy amid persistent inflationary pressures. This potential shift is contributing to a decline in the value of the pound as investors reassess their positions in light of changing monetary policy. With the USD strengthening and the euro maintaining its ground, the implications of the BoE's decision could further impact GBP's trading dynamics in the coming sessions.

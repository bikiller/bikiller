The Japanese Yen (JPY) has surged to a one-and-a-half-week high against the US Dollar (USD) as traders react to increasing expectations of a rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). During the Asian trading session on Tuesday, the JPY strengthened, with the USD/JPY exchange rate reflecting a shift in sentiment amid a broader decline in risk appetite across markets.

Market participants are increasingly confident that the BoJ will implement an interest rate increase in its upcoming meeting, which is driving demand for the yen. This upward momentum could lead to further appreciation of the JPY, particularly as the prevailing softer risk tone continues to influence trading decisions in the forex market.

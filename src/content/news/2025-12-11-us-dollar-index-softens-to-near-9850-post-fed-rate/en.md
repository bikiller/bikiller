The US Dollar Index (DXY) softened to approximately 98.55 during the Asian trading session on Thursday, reflecting broader market sentiment following the recent rate cut by the Federal Reserve. This decline signals investor caution as traders closely monitor the implications of the Fed's monetary policy on the USD's strength against major currencies.

With Jobless Claims data also in focus, volatility in the currency pair exchanges is expected. Market participants are weighing the potential impact of rising unemployment claims on the USD, particularly as the index hovers near critical technical levels. The current trading environment presents challenges for the EUR/USD exchange rate as it reacts to shifts in dollar strength and economic indicators.

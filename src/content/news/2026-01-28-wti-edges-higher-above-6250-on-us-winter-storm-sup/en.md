WTI crude oil prices are trading at $62.65 during Asian hours on Wednesday, edging higher as the market reacts to supply disruptions caused by a US winter storm. The extreme weather conditions have led to concerns about potential losses in US production, which has been a key driver of the price movement. As a result, traders are closely watching how this impacts future supply forecasts.

The recent uptick in WTI comes as a response to the uncertainty surrounding US energy output. With the storm disrupting oil production in key regions, the market remains sensitive to fluctuations in supply. This has led to increased volatility, potentially influencing other commodities and the USD as traders weigh the storm’s broader economic impact.

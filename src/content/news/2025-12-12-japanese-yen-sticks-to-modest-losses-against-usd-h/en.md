The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing modest losses against the US Dollar (USD) as it trades around 132.50 during the Asian session on Friday. Despite these intraday declines, the Yen's downside remains limited by rising hawkish sentiment surrounding the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which is drawing attention from traders.

Market expectations for a potential shift in BoJ policy have created a backdrop of support for the JPY, alleviating fears of more significant depreciation. As the currency pair shows resilience, investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic data and central bank announcements that could influence the exchange rate further, particularly against the Euro (EUR) as well.

EUR/GBP traded sideways on Monday, with the currency pair holding within a narrow range as investors refrained from taking aggressive positions ahead of key Eurozone CPI and German GDP releases. The exchange rate continued to consolidate recent losses, reflecting cautious trading conditions across the broader forex market, where attention also remains on USD dynamics and overall risk sentiment.

Repeated failures near the multi-month resistance around 0.8750 have capped upside attempts, reinforcing the technical ceiling that has limited bullish momentum in recent sessions. Each approach toward 0.8750 has drawn selling interest, keeping the EUR/GBP exchange rate anchored below this barrier and highlighting the importance of this level for near-term direction in the currency pair.

Market participants are closely watching incoming inflation and growth data for signals on the European Central Bank’s policy path. Softer Eurozone CPI or weaker German GDP could weigh on the EUR, while stronger figures may revive buying interest. Until clearer fundamental catalysts emerge, range-bound trading and cautious positioning are likely to dominate the EUR/GBP landscape.

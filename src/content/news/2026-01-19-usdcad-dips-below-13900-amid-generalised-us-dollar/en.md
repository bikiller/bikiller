The USD/CAD currency pair experienced a notable decline during Monday’s European session, dipping below the key psychological level of 1.3900. This move follows the US Dollar's reversal from Friday's high of 1.3928, reflecting a broader trend of weakness in the USD as traders assess market conditions.

The shift in the exchange rate highlights ongoing uncertainties in the forex market, with the US Dollar losing momentum against its Canadian counterpart. As the pair tests this critical support level, market participants will be closely monitoring economic developments and potential shifts in monetary policy that could further influence the USD/CAD trading dynamics.

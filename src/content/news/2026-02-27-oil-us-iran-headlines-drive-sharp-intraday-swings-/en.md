Brent oil experienced sharp volatility during the session, with prices swinging nearly 5% amid mixed signals from the US-Iran nuclear talks in Geneva. The uncertainty surrounding the negotiations created significant market turbulence, affecting oil prices and the broader trading environment. Traders closely monitored these developments, which caused fluctuations in the exchange rates of oil-related currency pairs, particularly USD-based pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

The intraday movement saw Brent Oil prices shift dramatically as reports from Geneva caused conflicting reactions in the market. With the ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, market participants adjusted their positions, leading to fluctuations in the USD and oil prices. These movements are expected to influence future trading strategies, particularly for investors in the energy sector and forex markets, as they continue to track the progress of US-Iran relations.

AUD/USD has slipped to approximately 0.6450 following a two-day rally, as traders brace for the upcoming release of Australia’s comprehensive Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. This eagerly awaited monthly CPI report, covering October, is set to be unveiled on Wednesday and could significantly influence the currency pair's exchange rate.

The recent depreciation of the Australian dollar against the USD reflects market caution as investors assess potential impacts on monetary policy. With the prospect of a pivotal CPI reading on the horizon, traders are closely monitoring fluctuations in the AUD/USD exchange rate, which could set the tone for further market movements in the days ahead.

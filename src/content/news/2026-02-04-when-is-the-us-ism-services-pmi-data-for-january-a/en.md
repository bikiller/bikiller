The US ISM Services PMI for January is set to be released today at 15:00 GMT, offering crucial insight into the state of the US economy. A strong reading could push the USD higher, potentially putting downward pressure on EUR/USD, currently trading around 1.0900. With the Fed's focus on inflation, the PMI results will likely influence expectations for future monetary tightening, further driving the currency pair’s movements.

Market participants will be watching for any signs of growth or contraction in the services sector, which could shift sentiment in favor of the USD. If the index comes in above forecasts, the US dollar may strengthen, potentially testing key support levels for EUR/USD. On the other hand, a weaker-than-expected print could weaken the greenback, allowing the euro to regain some ground. Traders will likely adjust their positions ahead of the release, contributing to short-term volatility.

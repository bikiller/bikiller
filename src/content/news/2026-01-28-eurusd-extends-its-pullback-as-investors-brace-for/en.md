The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing a modest pullback on Wednesday, retreating to 1.1985 from the four-year high of 1.2082 reached on Tuesday. The decline comes as investors prepare for the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, which is expected to provide insights into future monetary policy direction. 

The exchange rate shift reflects broader market caution, with traders closely monitoring the Fed’s stance on interest rates and inflation. As the Euro weakens against the USD, market participants remain on edge, awaiting potential volatility in the coming sessions. The outlook for EUR/USD remains tied to Fed decisions and global economic developments.

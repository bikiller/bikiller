Gold (XAU/USD) remained stable on Tuesday as market sentiment shifted towards a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December. Traders reacted to dovish comments from Fed officials, which fueled expectations for a softer monetary policy amid recent lackluster U.S. economic data. This shift in outlook has increased support for the precious metal, highlighting its appeal as a safe haven.

As the exchange rate for gold holds firm, the implications for other currency pairs are notable. The anticipated Fed rate cuts may weigh on the USD, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as a softer dollar could further bolster gold prices, making it an attractive trading option for investors seeking to hedge against inflation or economic uncertainty in the upcoming months.

EUR/JPY has edged lower following two consecutive days of gains, with the exchange rate hovering around 182.40 during the Asian trading session on Friday. The currency pair faces confluence resistance near the 182.50 mark, which aligns with the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA). The technical outlook suggests that EUR/JPY is testing the upper boundary of a descending channel, signaling a potential bullish reversal if it breaks through this resistance.

A sustained move above 182.50 could open the door for further upside, potentially targeting higher resistance levels. However, if the pair fails to clear this zone, the downtrend may resume, with 182.00 and 181.50 acting as key support levels. Market participants are closely monitoring this key technical level, as a break above could signal renewed bullish sentiment for EUR/JPY.

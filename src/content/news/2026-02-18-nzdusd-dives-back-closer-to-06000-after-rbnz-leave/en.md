The NZD/USD currency pair fell sharply, approaching the 0.6000 mark following the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) decision to hold interest rates steady. The central bank's announcement on Wednesday surprised traders, as the market had anticipated a more hawkish stance. As a result, the exchange rate dropped to fresh lows, reflecting concerns over slower economic growth and the RBNZ's cautious outlook.

This shift in sentiment left the New Zealand dollar under pressure, particularly as the US dollar remains relatively strong amid ongoing market volatility. With the NZD/USD now testing key technical support at 0.6000, traders will be closely monitoring the pair for signs of further weakness. A sustained break below this level could signal additional downside risk, as markets adjust to the RBNZ's more dovish policy stance.

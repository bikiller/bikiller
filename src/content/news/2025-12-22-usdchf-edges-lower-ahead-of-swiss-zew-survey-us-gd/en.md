USD/CHF is experiencing a downward trend as it trades around the 0.7930 level, reflecting a decrease of 0.40% on the day. Market participants are closely watching upcoming economic indicators, particularly the Swiss ZEW survey and the U.S. GDP release, which could significantly impact the exchange rate of this currency pair.

The movement in USD/CHF may be influenced by investor sentiment ahead of these critical data releases. A weaker GDP figure from the U.S. could lead to further declines in the dollar, while any positive surprises from the Swiss economic outlook might strengthen the franc, adding volatility to the trading session.

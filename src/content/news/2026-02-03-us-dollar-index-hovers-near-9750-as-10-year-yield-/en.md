The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, is trading just under 97.50 after two days of gains. As of Tuesday morning in Asia, the index is showing slight losses as the market digests the recent rise in the 10-year US Treasury yield. This uptick in yields signals a shift in Fed expectations, influencing investor sentiment.

The recent movement in the DXY highlights the impact of US bond yields on the dollar's value. The rising yield strengthens the USD, especially against the EUR and JPY, while the shift in market expectations for Federal Reserve policy continues to support the dollar. With the DXY hovering near 97.50, traders are closely monitoring any changes in the Fed's outlook and the broader bond market dynamics.

EUR/CHF extends its slide on Friday, with the currency pair trading near 0.9120 and edging closer to its all-time low of 0.9095. The exchange rate remains under pressure as subdued Swiss inflation reinforces expectations that price stability will persist, underpinning demand for the Swiss Franc (CHF). In the current trading environment, investors continue to favor the CHF amid cautious sentiment across broader forex markets.

Swiss inflation data showed price pressures remain muted, reducing the likelihood of aggressive policy easing from the Swiss National Bank. This backdrop has supported the Franc against major peers, including the EUR and USD, and kept the EUR/CHF pair on the defensive. Market participants are positioning for continued resilience in the CHF as low inflation sustains its safe-haven appeal.

Meanwhile, Eurozone GDP met forecasts, offering little fresh impetus for the Euro. While the data confirmed steady economic growth, it failed to spark meaningful buying interest in the single currency. As a result, the EUR/CHF exchange rate remains vulnerable, with traders closely watching the 0.9095 record low as a key technical support level in the near term.

Silver (XAG/USD) surged to $87.60 during the Asian session on Wednesday, climbing above the key $87.50 level. The price rebound follows last week’s historic correction, driven by a wave of dip-buying interest. Market sentiment has been bolstered by rising geopolitical risks, fueling demand for the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. 

The shift in trading sentiment has contributed to silver's robust recovery, especially as the US dollar (USD) remains under pressure. As geopolitical tensions continue to heighten, silver's appeal as a hedge against market volatility is growing, reflecting its positive price movement. Investors are closely monitoring the $87.50 level for further direction in the XAG/USD currency pair.

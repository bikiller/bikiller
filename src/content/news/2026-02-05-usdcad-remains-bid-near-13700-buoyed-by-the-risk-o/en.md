The USD/CAD currency pair continues to trade with a bullish bias, hovering near the 1.3700 mark. The US Dollar has gained for the second consecutive day, benefiting from a risk-off sentiment in the broader market. Despite initial attempts to break above 1.3700, the pair has struggled to sustain gains, currently trading at 1.3685. 

The Canadian Dollar remains under pressure as investors flock to the safe-haven USD amid growing market concerns. The subdued market sentiment is weighing on riskier assets, making the US Dollar the preferred choice for traders. This persistent risk aversion could maintain upward momentum for the USD/CAD exchange rate in the short term, with a potential for further testing of resistance levels above 1.3700.

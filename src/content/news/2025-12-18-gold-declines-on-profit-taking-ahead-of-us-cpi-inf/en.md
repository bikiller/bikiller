Gold (XAU/USD) has seen a decline during early European trading on Thursday, slipping below the $4,350 mark. The precious metal pulled back from its seven-week highs as profit-taking set in, coupled with a strengthening US Dollar (USD), which has been influencing market dynamics.

The move reflects a cautious sentiment among traders ahead of the eagerly anticipated US CPI inflation data release. As the USD regains ground, the exchange rate shifts, prompting investors to reassess their positions in the gold market. This development could signal further volatility in gold prices, depending on the outcome of the inflation report and its implications for future monetary policy.

USD/JPY is currently in a consolidation phase as traders await the Bank of Japan’s upcoming monetary policy meeting. The currency pair is trading under pressure, lacking significant momentum, with the market nearly fully pricing in a 25 basis points interest rate hike scheduled for December 19. Technical support levels are identified between 155.10 and 153.90, indicating potential areas of interest for market participants.

For the Japanese yen to stage a meaningful recovery, stronger guidance from the BOJ is essential, along with a commitment to fiscal prudence and a softer U.S. dollar. As investors closely monitor these developments, the exchange rate remains sensitive to shifts in monetary policy expectations, particularly in relation to both the USD and JPY. The outcome of this meeting could have considerable implications for trading strategies in the forex market.

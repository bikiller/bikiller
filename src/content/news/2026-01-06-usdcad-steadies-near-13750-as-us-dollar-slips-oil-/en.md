USD/CAD is holding steady around the 1.3760 mark during Asian trading hours on Tuesday, following mild gains over the past two sessions. The currency pair reflects limited movement as the US Dollar experiences a slight decline, primarily driven by easing concerns over broader geopolitical tensions.

The Canadian Dollar faces pressure from falling oil prices, which weigh on its value. As traders closely monitor the exchange rate, the interplay between the USD's fluctuations and commodity prices continues to influence market dynamics. With USD/CAD stabilizing near the 1.3750 level, investors are keenly watching for any signs of a shift in momentum.

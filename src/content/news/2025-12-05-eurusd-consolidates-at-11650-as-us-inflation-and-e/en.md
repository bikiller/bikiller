The EUR/USD currency pair held steady around the 1.1650 mark on Friday, signaling a week of modest gains as it prepared to close with a 0.39% rise. Trading activity has been subdued, reflecting uncertainty as market participants await critical decisions from the Federal Reserve next week, which could significantly influence the exchange rate.

Factors such as U.S. inflation data and risks associated with the European Central Bank (ECB) have shaped the outlook for the EUR/USD pair. The current consolidation around 1.1650 indicates a cautious approach among traders, highlighting the interplay between economic indicators and monetary policy that will affect future movements in this key currency pair.

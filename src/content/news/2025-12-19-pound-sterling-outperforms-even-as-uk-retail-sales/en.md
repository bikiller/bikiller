The Pound Sterling (GBP) is defying expectations in Friday's European session, trading higher against its major counterparts despite a surprising decline in UK Retail Sales for November. The exchange rate for GBP/USD has shown resilience, climbing to 1.3400, even as the data pointed to a contraction in consumer spending. Analysts had anticipated a steady performance, making this drop unexpected and raising concerns about the economic outlook.

In contrast, the EUR/GBP pair is witnessing shifts, with the euro losing ground as the GBP strengthens. The current exchange rate sits around 0.8450, reflecting increased investor confidence in the Pound despite the retail sales slump. This performance underscores the market’s focus on broader economic indicators and the potential for future monetary policy adjustments by the Bank of England, suggesting that traders will be closely monitoring upcoming economic releases for further direction.

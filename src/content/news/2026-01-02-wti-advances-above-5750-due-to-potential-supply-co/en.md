West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices surged above $57.50, reaching approximately $57.70 during European trading hours on Friday. This upward movement is primarily driven by rising supply concerns linked to escalating geopolitical tensions, which have the potential to disrupt oil supplies in the global market.

As traders monitor these developments closely, the implications for the USD and other currency pairs could be significant. The fluctuations in oil prices often influence exchange rates, especially for currencies of oil-exporting nations. Investors are advised to keep an eye on these geopolitical events, as they may lead to increased volatility in the forex market and impact trading strategies involving the USD and EUR.

Market attention on Thursday, February 26, is focused on the ongoing US-Iran talks, which could influence global sentiment and trading dynamics. The US dollar (USD) saw mixed trading, with the EUR/USD exchange rate hovering near 1.0600. A rise in US Treasury yields helped strengthen the greenback, pushing it higher against the euro by 0.3%. Meanwhile, the GBP/USD struggled to maintain gains, sitting at 1.2060, weighed down by ongoing UK economic concerns.

Mid-tier US economic data will also play a crucial role in market movement today. Key reports, including the weekly jobless claims and the personal income and spending data, could provide insights into the strength of the US economy. These figures may affect the USD’s performance, especially against major pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY, which remains anchored around the 136.40 mark. Traders will closely monitor these releases for signs of inflationary pressure or any shifts in economic momentum.

Silver (XAG/USD) is experiencing a pullback on Thursday, as traders take a moment to secure profits after the metal's recent ascent to record highs near $58.98. Currently, the currency pair is trading at approximately $56.87, reflecting a decline of about 2.77% for the day. This easing suggests a temporary pause in bullish momentum, allowing sellers to step in.

The recent RSI divergence indicates a weakening of upward momentum, prompting market participants to reassess their positions. As the exchange rate adjusts, the movement could have significant implications for future trading strategies, particularly for those focused on the precious metals market. Investors will be closely monitoring the price action in the coming sessions to gauge whether this pullback is a short-term correction or a sign of a more substantial trend reversal.

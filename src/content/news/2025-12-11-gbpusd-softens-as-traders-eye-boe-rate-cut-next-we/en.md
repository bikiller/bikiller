The GBP/USD currency pair is experiencing a downturn, trading in negative territory around 1.3365 during early European hours on Thursday. This decline is mainly attributed to a rebound in the US Dollar (USD), which has strengthened against several currencies, including the British Pound (GBP). Market sentiment remains cautious as traders anticipate a potential interest rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE) next week.

As the exchange rate fluctuates, the implications for the GBP become significant, especially if the BoE decides to adjust its monetary policy amid ongoing economic challenges. The current pressure on the pound could lead to increased volatility in the GBP/USD pair, influencing trading strategies as investors reassess their positions ahead of the central bank's decision.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) fell to a three-week low, dropping below $4,550 during early European trading on Monday. The decline comes amid a wave of profit-taking following recent gains, weighing on the precious metal. Investors showed a cautious outlook, triggered by uncertainty over upcoming monetary policy actions and broader market sentiment.

The market’s shift in focus to the Federal Reserve’s upcoming chair nomination has contributed to the downward pressure. As expectations build for a more hawkish stance from the Fed, the USD strengthened, impacting gold’s appeal. The exchange rate for XAU/USD now faces strong resistance around the $4,600 mark, with analysts eyeing further moves depending on upcoming economic reports and central bank decisions.

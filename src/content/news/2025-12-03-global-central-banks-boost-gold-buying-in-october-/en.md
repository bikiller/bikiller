In October, global central banks significantly increased their gold reserves, adding a net 53 tonnes, the largest rise since November 2024. Poland and Brazil were at the forefront of this surge, reflecting a strategic shift amid ongoing economic uncertainties. This uptick in gold buying can influence the currency markets, particularly the exchange rates of the USD and EUR, as investors often flock to gold during periods of volatility.

As central banks bolster their gold holdings, traders may see a shift in market dynamics, potentially strengthening safe-haven currencies like the USD against riskier assets. This movement could impact key currency pairs, especially as inflation concerns persist and central banks reassess their monetary policies. Analysts will be closely monitoring these trends, as the interplay between gold purchases and currency valuations could signal broader economic shifts in the coming months.

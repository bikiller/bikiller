The EUR/JPY currency pair saw a modest gain on Monday, with the Euro strengthening against the Japanese Yen. As of writing, the exchange rate is hovering around 181.76, up 0.20% for the day. This movement comes as the Yen faces downward pressure, spurred by Japan's disappointing GDP data, which missed market expectations and fueled concerns over the country's economic performance.

Traders are now closely monitoring EUR/JPY’s technical levels, particularly the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), as the pair has recently broken out of its previous range. A sustained move below this key level could signal further bearish momentum, potentially pushing the exchange rate lower. The market's focus remains on Japan's economic data and how it may influence the broader forex market in the coming days.

The EUR/USD currency pair is facing mild upward pressure, with the euro edging higher against the US dollar. Analysts from UOB, Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann, foresee a potential move toward the 1.1840 mark, fueled by positive momentum. However, they caution that resistance at 1.1860 is likely to prevent further gains in the short term, maintaining a ceiling on the euro's rise.

The EUR/USD exchange rate is expected to test these key levels, but the resistance zone around 1.1860 could pose challenges for bulls. While upward momentum remains intact, traders should be cautious of this technical barrier, as any breach could open the door for more substantial advances. With the USD showing relative strength, the euro's movement remains constrained in the near future.

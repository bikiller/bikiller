The Australian Dollar (AUD) is gaining momentum as it trades higher against a weaker US Dollar (USD), with the AUD/USD currency pair reaching a fresh high not seen since late October. The exchange rate is approaching the 0.6600 level as traders react to the hawkish stance of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has provided support despite a disappointing Q3 GDP report.

As the European session unfolds, the upward movement of the AUD is notable, reflecting market sentiment that favors riskier assets amid the broader softness of the USD. The ongoing strength of the RBA's monetary policy may continue to attract buyers, potentially driving the AUD/USD pair even higher in the coming sessions, while traders keep an eye on economic developments that could impact the exchange rate dynamics.

AUD/JPY continues to trade positively, hovering around 104.90 during Asian trading hours on Monday. The currency pair is buoyed by persistent weakness in the Japanese Yen (JPY), which is under pressure due to growing fiscal concerns surrounding Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansive spending initiatives aimed at stimulating economic growth.

The rise in AUD/JPY reflects broader market sentiment as investors weigh the implications of Japan's fiscal policies. With the Yen's vulnerability intensifying, the exchange rate could see further fluctuations. Traders are closely monitoring developments, as any changes to Japan's economic outlook may impact the AUD/JPY dynamics and influence broader currency trading strategies, including those involving USD and EUR.

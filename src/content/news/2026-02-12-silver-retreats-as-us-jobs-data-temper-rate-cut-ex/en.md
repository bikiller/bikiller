Silver (XAG/USD) is trading lower on Thursday, with the price hovering around $82.85, marking a 1.95% decline for the day. The metal is experiencing a pullback after reaching a weekly high of $86.30, as the market reacts to stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data. This report has led to tempered expectations of an imminent rate cut by the Federal Reserve, adding pressure to precious metals.

Despite the current retreat, the overall bullish trend for silver remains intact, with the immediate support levels holding steady. Traders are closely monitoring any further shifts in the U.S. economic outlook, as stronger employment figures may influence future Fed decisions, impacting the broader market sentiment and exchange rate movements.

The EUR/USD currency pair is beginning the week with a slight negative bias, currently trading around the 1.1730 mark. This drop comes as the US dollar shows signs of recovery. Despite this soft start, the pair remains close to the highest level seen since early October, which was reached last Thursday. The exchange rate is down less than 0.10% for the day, indicating limited downside potential.

Market dynamics suggest that the recent strength of the USD is influencing the EUR/USD movement, with traders closely monitoring any shifts in economic data that could impact the exchange rate. As the week unfolds, the ability of the euro to maintain its ground against the dollar will be essential, particularly as geopolitical and economic factors continue to play a significant role in currency trading.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) is under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) as trading continues in the Asian session on Tuesday. The exchange rate reflects ongoing concerns regarding Japan’s fiscal stability, primarily driven by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's plans for increased spending and tax cuts. As a result, the USD/JPY currency pair is seeing elevated volatility, with the yen struggling to gain traction.

Market sentiment has shifted as fiscal worries overshadow a hawkish outlook from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Investors are cautious, weighing the implications of larger government spending against potential inflationary pressures. This has kept the JPY on the defensive, with the USD trading firmly above key technical levels, suggesting that the outlook may remain challenging for the yen in the short term.

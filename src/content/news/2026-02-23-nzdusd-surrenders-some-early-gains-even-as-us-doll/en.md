The NZD/USD currency pair pulled back from its early gains during the European trading session on Monday, retracing about half of its earlier advance. The pair had initially surged above the key psychological level of 0.6000, but faced strong selling pressure that limited its upside potential. Despite a fragile US Dollar, the New Zealand Dollar struggled to maintain its bullish momentum.

The US Dollar remained under pressure amid a cautious market sentiment, but this weakness was not enough to sustain NZD/USD above the 0.6000 level. Traders are closely watching developments for further direction, with the pair potentially finding support near 0.5950 if the bearish pressure continues. As the week progresses, focus may shift to US economic data, which could influence USD dynamics and impact the exchange rate.

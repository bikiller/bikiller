The Pound Sterling has gained momentum as traders ramp up expectations for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its December meeting. The GBP/USD currency pair is currently trading at 1.3082, reflecting a modest increase of 0.08%. This sentiment shift has allowed the British currency to rise despite recent soft signals from the US PMI, highlighting the market's focus on Fed policy.

As the market digests these developments, the exchange rate indicates a growing divergence in monetary policy outlooks between the UK and the US. If the Fed follows through with cuts, it could further enhance the appeal of the British pound against the USD, potentially leading to more volatility in the forex market. Traders will be closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators as they reassess their positions ahead of the Fed's decision.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) rebounded sharply after two days of declines, reaching a new record high of $94.15 earlier today. As trading progressed during early European hours on Monday, the price stabilized around $93.70 per troy ounce. This movement indicates renewed investor interest, possibly driven by rising demand amid ongoing economic uncertainties.

The surge in silver comes as the U.S. dollar (USD) fluctuates against other currencies, influencing trading dynamics in the forex market. As traders assess the implications of potential monetary policy changes and inflationary pressures, silver's performance may signal a broader trend. Market participants will closely monitor these developments, as ongoing volatility could further impact the exchange rate of XAG/USD in the coming sessions.

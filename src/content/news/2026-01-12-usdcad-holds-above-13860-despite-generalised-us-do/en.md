The USD/CAD currency pair remains resilient above the 1.3860 level, even as the US Dollar experiences broad-based declines. This downward movement in the USD is primarily driven by rising concerns surrounding the independence of the US Federal Reserve, which has heightened market uncertainty.

In the current trading environment, the exchange rate dynamics reveal investors' cautious sentiment towards the USD amid speculation about potential shifts in Fed policy. With the USD weakening against major currencies, including the EUR, traders are closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence future monetary decisions. As the USD/CAD holds firm, market participants are keenly observing its next moves amidst ongoing economic developments.

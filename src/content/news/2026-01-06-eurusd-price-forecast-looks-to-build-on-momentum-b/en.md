The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing renewed buying interest, with the exchange rate finding support around the 1.1710 level during the Asian session on Tuesday. This upward movement follows a strong rebound from a nearly four-week low of 1.1660, indicating that traders are becoming increasingly optimistic about the euro's performance against the dollar.

As the pair aims to build momentum beyond the key resistance level of 1.1735, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could influence the USD's strength. A sustained move above this confluence area may signal further bullish sentiment, potentially allowing the euro to capitalize on recent gains in the trading landscape.

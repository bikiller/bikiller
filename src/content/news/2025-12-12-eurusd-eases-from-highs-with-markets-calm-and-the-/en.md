EUR/USD experienced a slight pullback on Friday, trading at 1.1730 after reaching a peak of 1.1762 the previous day, its highest level in over two months. This decline reflects a calm market environment alongside a generally weaker US Dollar, which has put downward pressure on the currency pair.

The exchange rate movement highlights the ongoing dynamics between the euro and USD, as traders assess economic indicators and shifts in sentiment. The recent highs may have attracted profit-taking, indicating that while bullish momentum remains, caution prevails in the current trading landscape. With the USD under pressure, the outlook for EUR/USD will be closely monitored in the coming sessions for potential direction.

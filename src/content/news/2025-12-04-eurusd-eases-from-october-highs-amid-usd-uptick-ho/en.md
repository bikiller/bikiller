The EUR/USD currency pair experienced a slight retreat during the Asian session on Thursday, pulling back from recent highs reached on October 17. Currently trading in the 1.1660-1.1655 region, the exchange rate has seen some erosion of the previous day's strong gains. This move comes amid a modest uptick in the USD, which has put pressure on the euro.

Despite the dip, the downside for the EUR/USD appears limited, bolstered by a supportive fundamental backdrop. Traders are keeping a close eye on upcoming economic data that could influence the pair's direction, as the market remains optimistic about the euro's resilience against the dollar in the near term.

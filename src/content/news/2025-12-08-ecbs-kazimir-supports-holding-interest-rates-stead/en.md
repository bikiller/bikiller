European Central Bank policymaker Peter Kazimir expressed support for maintaining steady interest rates during the ECB's upcoming policy meeting this December. Speaking during the European session on Monday, Kazimir indicated that he sees no compelling reasons for any changes to the current monetary policy, which suggests a continued dovish stance that could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate.

As traders digest this information, the euro remains under pressure against the US dollar, with the EUR/USD pair hovering around key technical levels. Market participants are closely monitoring any shifts in policy sentiment, as stable interest rates could stabilize the euro in the short term. The outlook for the eurozone economy and inflation rates will likely play a crucial role in upcoming trading sessions.

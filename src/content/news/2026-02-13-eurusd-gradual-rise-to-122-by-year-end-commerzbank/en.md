Commerzbank maintains a constructive outlook on the EUR/USD currency pair, projecting the exchange rate to reach 1.19 in the first quarter of 2026. The strategy team expects the Euro to remain supported against the USD amid improving macroeconomic conditions in the Eurozone and a more balanced monetary policy backdrop. This steady appreciation reflects confidence in underlying EUR resilience.

Looking further ahead, the bank anticipates a gradual rise in EUR/USD toward 1.22 by year-end 2026. The forecast suggests a measured upward trend rather than sharp volatility, with trading likely driven by shifting interest rate differentials and evolving Federal Reserve policy. A softer USD environment could provide additional tailwinds for the pair over the medium term.

For traders, the projected move from current levels toward 1.19 and eventually 1.22 implies sustained bullish momentum in the currency pair. Market participants may increasingly price in narrowing policy divergence between the European Central Bank and the Fed. If realized, the higher exchange rate would signal renewed confidence in the EUR and potentially reshape broader USD positioning across forex markets.

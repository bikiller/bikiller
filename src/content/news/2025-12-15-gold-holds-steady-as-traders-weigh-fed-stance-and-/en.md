Gold (XAU/USD) demonstrated resilience on Monday, reaching a daily high of $4,350 before profit-taking by traders led to a decline in its value. Currently, the precious metal is trading at $4,296, showing minimal change as the market digests the implications of the Federal Reserve's stance and upcoming economic data releases.

As the U.S. dollar (USD) continues to weaken, gold's appeal remains intact, offering a safe haven for investors amid fluctuating market conditions. The interplay between the currency pair and macroeconomic indicators will be crucial in determining gold's trajectory in the coming days, as traders remain vigilant for any signs that could influence the exchange rate and overall commodity trading landscape.

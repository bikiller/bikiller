The Euro has struggled to gain traction in the forex market, even as expectations for interest rate hikes have risen. According to Commerzbank’s Head of FX and Commodity Research, Thu Lan Nguyen, recent movements in the EUR/USD exchange rate have been primarily driven by a weakening US Dollar rather than any strengthening of the Euro’s fundamentals. This lack of momentum raises questions about the Euro's resilience in the face of potential monetary policy shifts.

As traders navigate the current landscape, the EUR/USD currency pair remains sensitive to broader market dynamics. Despite the positive sentiment surrounding rate hikes, the Euro's performance indicates that it may not fully capitalize on these developments. Investors will need to monitor both economic indicators and geopolitical events closely, as they could further influence the exchange rate and overall trading strategies in the coming weeks.

The GBP/USD currency pair is showing signs of upward movement as it attracts buyers near the 1.3430 mark during early trading hours in Europe on Monday. This buying interest suggests a potential momentum shift, with immediate resistance now emerging above the key level of 1.3450. Traders are closely watching these levels for potential breakouts or reversals.

The exchange rate's behavior around 1.3430 indicates the market's reaction to recent economic data and sentiment surrounding the USD. Continued support at this level may encourage further bullish action, while a failure to breach the 1.3450 resistance could lead to a pullback. Forex participants are advised to monitor these technical levels closely as they navigate their trading strategies.

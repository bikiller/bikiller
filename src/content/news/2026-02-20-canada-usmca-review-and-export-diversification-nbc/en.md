Canada's trade diversification from the U.S. in 2025 is mainly attributed to a surge in gold exports, as highlighted by Ethan Currie from National Bank of Canada. This shift, while notable, has masked weaker overall trade growth, with non-gold exports showing less promising results. The Canadian dollar (CAD) saw some volatility, driven by market reactions to these shifts in trade patterns, as traders adjusted expectations for future currency pairs like USD/CAD.

While gold exports bolstered Canada's figures, the underlying weakness in other sectors left the broader economic outlook uncertain. The USD/CAD exchange rate fluctuated, reflecting these dynamics as investors weighed the implications for future economic growth. This has raised concerns about Canada's reliance on a few sectors, with traders eyeing potential impacts on both the loonie and broader global market trends.

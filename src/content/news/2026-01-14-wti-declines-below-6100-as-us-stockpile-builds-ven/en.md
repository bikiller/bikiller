West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the US crude oil benchmark, has fallen below the $61.00 mark, trading around $60.70 during Wednesday's Asian session. This decline follows the resumption of Venezuelan oil exports, which has increased market supply, and a significant build in US crude inventories reported by the American Petroleum Institute (API).

As WTI prices weaken, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the broader oil market and its potential impact on related currency pairs. A softer oil price often influences the USD, as the US is one of the world's largest oil producers. Market sentiment remains cautious as fluctuations in oil prices can affect exchange rates, particularly against currencies like the EUR, as concerns about oversupply persist.

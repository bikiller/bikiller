West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil stabilized on Wednesday, recovering from earlier losses as traders reacted to the latest report from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), which indicated a draw of 1.8 million barrels. Currently, WTI is trading at approximately $58.00, after dipping to an intraday low of $57.54. The market's cautious optimism suggests potential influence from the upcoming Federal Reserve decision.

As the focus shifts towards monetary policy, the USD's performance could significantly impact the WTI price and broader market sentiment. The current exchange rate dynamics, especially against the EUR, will further define the trading landscape in the coming days. A robust Fed statement may bolster the USD, potentially leading to fluctuations in oil prices as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of broader economic implications.

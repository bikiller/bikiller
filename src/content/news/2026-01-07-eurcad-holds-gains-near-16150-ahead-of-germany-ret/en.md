EUR/CAD is enjoying a third consecutive day of gains, trading steadily around the 1.6150 mark during the Asian hours on Wednesday. This upward movement comes as traders prepare for the release of key economic indicators from Germany, including Retail Sales and Unemployment data for November, which could influence market sentiment.

The anticipation surrounding these reports is contributing to the currency pair's strength, as investors assess potential impacts on the Eurozone economy. A positive surprise in the data could further bolster the EUR, while disappointing figures may lead to volatility in the exchange rate. Market participants remain cautious, closely monitoring developments that could affect the EUR/CAD trajectory in the coming sessions.

Gold (XAU/USD) continues its remarkable rally, extending its gains for the fifth consecutive day as it hits a new all-time high of approximately $4,967 during Friday’s Asian trading session. The precious metal’s persistent upward momentum is driven by growing expectations of a Fed rate cut, which has led investors to seek safer assets like gold. 

This surge in gold prices comes amidst shifting market sentiment, where traders are betting on a potential reduction in U.S. interest rates. The rising demand for gold reflects broader concerns about the USD's weakening outlook and its implications for the global currency market.

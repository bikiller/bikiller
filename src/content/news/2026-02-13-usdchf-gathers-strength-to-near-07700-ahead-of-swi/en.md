The USD/CHF currency pair is trading in positive territory around 0.7700 as the European session begins on Friday. The pair has gained momentum, driven by increasing market expectations that the US Federal Reserve will maintain its current interest rates, ruling out any cuts in the near future. This outlook has provided strength to the US dollar against the Swiss Franc.

The exchange rate of USD/CHF is currently supported by the Fed's stance on interest rates, which contrasts with concerns over the European Central Bank’s policies. As investors await upcoming inflation data from both the US and Switzerland, the technical level near 0.7700 remains a key area of focus. Any surprise moves in the CPI releases could potentially alter the pair's trajectory in the near term.

The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, with the NZD/USD currency pair trading around 0.5770, reflecting a decline of 0.10% for the day. After reaching a high of 0.5790 earlier, the pair reversed its gains as risk appetite among investors diminished, prompting a more cautious market sentiment.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) supportive stance has helped cushion the losses for the Kiwi, despite the overall trend toward risk aversion. The shift in sentiment suggests that traders are closely monitoring global economic developments, which could further impact the exchange rate movements in the coming sessions.

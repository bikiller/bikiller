GBP/USD is facing significant pressure, hovering near 1.3500 during the European session on Thursday, marking its lowest point in nearly four weeks. The currency pair has been unable to hold onto recent gains, following a breakdown in the VCP (volatility contraction pattern), which has raised concerns among traders.

The struggle to maintain the 1.3500 level reflects broader weakness in the Pound against the US Dollar. The USD continues to benefit from strong economic data, while the GBP faces challenges from uncertainty surrounding UK economic recovery. As GBP/USD remains near key technical support, traders will closely monitor any developments that could push the pair either lower or bring a potential rebound.

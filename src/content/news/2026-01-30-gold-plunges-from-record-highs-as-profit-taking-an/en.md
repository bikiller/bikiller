Gold (XAU/USD) faced heavy selling pressure on Friday, retreating sharply from record highs as profit-taking dominated trading flows. After a strong weekly rally, extreme volatility triggered widespread liquidation of leveraged positions, accelerating the downside move. The precious metal’s exchange rate weakened as short-term traders rushed to lock in gains at elevated levels.

A firmer US Dollar added to the bearish momentum, with the USD attracting safe-haven demand across major currency pairs. As the greenback strengthened against peers such as the EUR and GBP, gold became less attractive for non-USD buyers. The inverse relationship between gold and the dollar reasserted itself, amplifying losses during thin and fast-moving market conditions.

From a broader forex perspective, the pullback highlights how sensitive commodities remain to shifts in USD direction and risk sentiment. If dollar strength persists, XAU/USD may struggle to regain upside traction in the near term, prompting traders to reassess positioning. Attention now turns to upcoming US data and central bank signals, which could influence trading dynamics across currencies and precious metals alike.

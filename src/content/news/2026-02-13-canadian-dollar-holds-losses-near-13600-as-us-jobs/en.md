The USD/CAD exchange rate saw modest gains, trading around 1.3615 during the Asian session on Friday. The US Dollar strengthened against the Canadian Dollar as market sentiment shifted in favor of a more hawkish Federal Reserve stance. With the latest US jobs data showing robust employment growth, expectations of an imminent interest rate cut by the Fed have significantly diminished.

This move in the USD/CAD pair reflects a broader market reassessment of US monetary policy. The data has given investors confidence that the Fed may hold rates steady for the time being, putting pressure on the Canadian Dollar. As a result, the exchange rate remains near the key 1.3600 level, with further volatility likely depending on upcoming economic reports from both sides of the border.

EUR/USD plunged to a new yearly low, dipping below the 1.1600 mark on Thursday as robust economic data from the United States bolstered the Dollar. The exchange rate shift demonstrated increased trader confidence, driven partly by President Trump's softened stance on Iran, which contributed to a more favorable market environment for the USD.

Meanwhile, disappointing economic indicators from the Eurozone failed to provide support for the Euro, exacerbating the decline in the EUR/USD currency pair. As traders react to these developments, market sentiment remains focused on the contrasting economic outlooks of the US and Eurozone, suggesting potential for further fluctuations in the exchange rate in the days ahead.

Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a slight pullback during the Asian trading session on Friday, yet it remains close to its highest level since October 21, which it reached the previous day. Currently, the precious metal is trading just below these key technical levels, reflecting ongoing market caution amid the Federal Reserve's dovish outlook.

The Fed's stance has influenced market sentiment, leading to fluctuations in the exchange rate as investors weigh the implications for future monetary policy. With gold hovering near these elevated levels, the market is poised for potential volatility, particularly if economic data or Fed commentary prompts shifts in the USD and broader forex dynamics.

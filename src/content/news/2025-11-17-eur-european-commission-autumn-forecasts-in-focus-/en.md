Market participants will turn their attention to the European Commission's autumn forecasts this Monday, following a quiet trading session. In its spring update, the Commission revised down its GDP projections for the euro area to 0.9% for 2025 and 1.4% for 2026, alongside inflation estimates of 2.5% and 1.7%, respectively. These adjustments could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate, as traders assess the implications for monetary policy.

As the euro continues to trade under pressure, these forecasts may further affect market sentiment toward the euro. Should the Commission’s figures indicate a weaker economic outlook, we could see increased volatility in the EUR/USD pair, potentially testing technical support levels. Investors will be closely monitoring how these projections shape the European Central Bank's future decisions, especially as the USD remains strong amid ongoing interest rate discussions.

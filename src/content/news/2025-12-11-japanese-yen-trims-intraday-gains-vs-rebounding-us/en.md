The Japanese Yen (JPY) has seen a retreat from its earlier gains during the Asian session as it trades against a strengthening US Dollar (USD). The exchange rate for USD/JPY reflects this shift, with the pair rising from lows, indicating a recovery in the USD. Despite this pullback, the Yen's decline is limited, suggesting a resilient market sentiment amid ongoing hawkish bets on the Bank of Japan (BoJ).

As traders focus on the implications of BoJ's monetary policy, the market remains cautious. The USD's rebound is largely fueled by expectations of a more aggressive stance from the Federal Reserve, which contrasts with the BoJ's current dovish approach. The JPY's ability to hold steady against the USD may provide support for bulls, keeping the currency pair within a defined range as trading dynamics unfold.

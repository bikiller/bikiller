The Canadian Dollar (CAD) has gained momentum as the US Dollar (USD) struggles in the forex market. The USD/CAD currency pair is currently trading around 1.3560, marking a significant pullback. This comes after the pair broke its long-term uptrend, which had been in place since 2021, during the first quarter of 2025. 

The break of the long-term trendline signals a shift in market sentiment, with the CAD gaining strength against the USD. The bearish structure on the daily chart highlights a weakening US Dollar, while the Canadian Dollar benefits from stronger commodity prices and a more resilient economic outlook. Traders will be closely monitoring this technical shift for further signs of USD weakness.

Gold (XAU/USD) regained momentum during Tuesday’s American session, rebounding after a significant correction last week that saw prices drop from record highs near $5,600. The precious metal surged more than 5% earlier in the day, as dip buyers re-entered the market, eager to capitalize on the sharp decline.

The currency pair is now consolidating its gains, with market attention turning to the next key resistance level at $5,000. The rally highlights continued volatility in gold trading, with the correction offering a potential buying opportunity for traders looking to take advantage of gold’s long-term strength amidst ongoing market uncertainty.

The Indian Rupee (INR) gained ground against the US Dollar (USD) in early Monday trading, following the announcement of India's fiscal budget for the Financial Year (FY) 2026-27. The INR strengthened as traders reacted to the government's budget plans, with the USD/INR currency pair dipping below 82.50. This move reflects initial market optimism regarding India’s economic outlook and fiscal policy.

Despite the recent strength of the Rupee, the upside for USD/INR remains favored. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been actively intervening in the market, helping to stabilize the INR. However, broader market dynamics, including global USD trends and potential geopolitical risks, suggest that the Rupee may struggle to maintain its recent gains. The USD/INR exchange rate continues to face resistance around the 82.50 mark, with further fluctuations expected in the near term.

The GBP/USD currency pair struggles to gain traction despite a modest recovery from its weekly low of 1.3445. The pair has been moving within a narrow range during the Asian trading session on Friday, reflecting a lack of strong momentum. This hesitation comes as UK political uncertainty continues to weigh on the pound, alongside expectations of a dovish shift from the Bank of England.

The ongoing concerns surrounding the BoE's easing bias, coupled with political instability, are keeping buyers at bay. The exchange rate remains vulnerable, with resistance levels limiting upward movement. For now, GBP/USD traders will likely remain cautious, watching for fresh catalysts that could drive more decisive price action.

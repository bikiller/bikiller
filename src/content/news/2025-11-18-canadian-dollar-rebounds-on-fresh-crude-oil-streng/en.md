The Canadian Dollar (CAD) rebounded on Tuesday, rising approximately 0.5% against the US Dollar (USD) as crude oil prices surged in the early week. This uptick in oil prices has provided crucial support for the otherwise struggling Loonie, highlighting the strong correlation between Canada’s currency and commodity prices, particularly oil.

As traders responded to the positive momentum in crude, the CAD/USD exchange rate showed signs of recovery, reflecting increased confidence in the Canadian economy. With oil being a major export for Canada, this movement suggests potential for further gains in the Loonie, depending on the sustainability of crude’s upward trajectory in the coming days.

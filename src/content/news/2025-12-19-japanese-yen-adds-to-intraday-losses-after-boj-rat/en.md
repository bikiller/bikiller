The Japanese Yen (JPY) faced significant selling pressure following the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) highly anticipated interest rate decision. As a result, the USD/JPY currency pair surged past the 156.00 level, reaching a one-and-a-half-week high during the Asian trading session on Friday. This movement reflects a market shift, as traders react to the central bank's policy changes.

Attention now turns to BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's upcoming press conference, where insights into future monetary policy could further influence the exchange rate. The market is keen to gauge Ueda's views on inflation and economic recovery, which may dictate the Yen's trajectory in the coming days. With the USD gaining strength, the implications for the JPY could be significant as traders reassess their positions in this volatile market environment.

Weak UK employment data and persistent inflationary pressures are keeping the Bank of England (BoE) in a cautious stance, potentially leading to further rate cuts. Commerzbank's Antje Praefcke highlighted that despite recent tightening measures, the BoE may be inclined to reduce rates again, with March remaining a viable option after a tight February decision. This dovish bias is putting continued pressure on the GBP.

As a result, GBP/USD has remained under pressure, with the exchange rate struggling to maintain any significant gains. The pair faces resistance near the 1.2450 level, while key support lies around 1.2300. A rate cut scenario could weaken the pound further against both the USD and the EUR, as traders anticipate additional dovish rhetoric from the BoE in upcoming meetings. Sterling's outlook remains closely tied to UK economic data and global risk sentiment.

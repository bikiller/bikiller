The forex market remains focused on key economic data from the Eurozone and the US. EUR/USD traded at 1.0850 on Friday, holding steady as traders await Eurozone GDP figures for Q4. A positive reading could bolster the euro, while a weaker result may push the pair lower. In the US, February inflation data is expected to show a slight decrease, with markets eyeing the impact on future Federal Reserve policy.

The US dollar strengthened slightly against major currencies ahead of inflation data, with the DXY index ticking up to 103.50. A lower-than-expected inflation print could lead to a pullback in USD strength, while a higher reading might solidify expectations of further rate hikes. The market continues to navigate a delicate balance between growth concerns and inflationary pressures, keeping volatility high in currency trading.

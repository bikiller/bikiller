Silver prices (XAG/USD) surged above $76.50, reaching approximately $76.55 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday. The increase reflects a rise in safe-haven demand driven by geopolitical tensions surrounding Venezuela, particularly following the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro. This development has heightened market uncertainty, prompting investors to seek refuge in precious metals.

The boost in silver's value comes amid a backdrop of fluctuating currency pairs, as traders assess the implications for the USD and EUR. With the silver exchange rate showing resilience, market participants are closely monitoring further developments in Venezuela and potential impacts on global economic stability. Such dynamics may continue to influence trading patterns in the precious metals market.

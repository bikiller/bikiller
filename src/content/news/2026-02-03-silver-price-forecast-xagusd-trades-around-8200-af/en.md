Silver (XAG/USD) made a notable rebound in Asian trading on Tuesday, recovering from a sharp drop of over 32% in the previous two sessions. The currency pair was last seen trading at $81.90 per troy ounce, showing signs of stabilization after its significant losses. The volatility highlights the ongoing pressure on precious metals, driven by fluctuating investor sentiment and broader market conditions.

The silver price’s sharp reversal comes amid a stronger USD, which has been supported by robust U.S. economic data. The current exchange rate reflects market participants' cautious approach to risk, with traders closely monitoring Federal Reserve policies. While the bounce could suggest some short-term relief, silver remains vulnerable to further swings, especially if USD strength persists or broader market trends shift again.

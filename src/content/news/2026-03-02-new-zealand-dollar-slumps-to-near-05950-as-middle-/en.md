The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) dropped to a near 0.5955 against the US Dollar (USD) during the early Asian session on Monday. The decline was driven by the strengthening USD, which rose on the back of growing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The escalating conflict has increased demand for safer assets, putting pressure on risk-sensitive currencies like the Kiwi.

Traders are closely watching the developments surrounding the US-Iran tensions, as any further escalation could continue to bolster the USD. This shift in sentiment has led to a marked decline in the NZD/USD exchange rate, with the pair now hovering near critical support levels. The impact of these geopolitical events is likely to keep volatility high in the coming days.

The USD/CAD currency pair continues to face downward pressure, marking its third consecutive day of losses as it trades around 1.3680 during the early European session on Wednesday. This movement keeps the exchange rate near five-month lows, reflecting a cautious market sentiment as traders assess economic indicators and geopolitical developments.

On the daily chart, a bullish descending wedge pattern has emerged, characterized by converging trendlines that suggest a potential upside breakout. If the pair successfully breaks above the 1.3700 level, it could signal a shift in momentum, enticing buyers to enter the market. Traders will be watching this setup closely, as it may provide opportunities for a rebound in the USD against its Canadian counterpart.

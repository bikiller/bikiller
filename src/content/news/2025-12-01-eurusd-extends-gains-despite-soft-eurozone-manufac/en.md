EUR/USD continues to show resilience, extending its gains for the sixth consecutive day as it trades just below two-week highs at 1.1620. Despite disappointing manufacturing data from the Eurozone, the currency pair demonstrates a moderately firm tone, indicating a robust sentiment among traders. The exchange rate reflects ongoing demand for the euro against the USD, bolstered by underlying factors in the market.

The soft manufacturing figures may have raised concerns about economic growth in the Eurozone, yet the exchange rate has not faltered. This divergence suggests that traders remain confident in the euro's strength, possibly looking ahead to upcoming economic indicators that could further influence the currency pair. As EUR/USD hovers around these levels, market participants are keenly watching for any signs of volatility that could reshape the current trading landscape.

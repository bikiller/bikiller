The EUR/JPY currency pair has shown weakness, trading below the key technical level of 180.50 as it attracts sellers around 180.45 during the early European session on Monday. This shift in momentum comes as the Japanese Yen (JPY) gains strength against the Euro (EUR) following remarks from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda, who suggested a potential rate hike.

Ueda's comments have sparked renewed interest in the JPY, impacting the exchange rate dynamics between these two major currencies. As traders respond to the possibility of tighter monetary policy in Japan, the shift in sentiment underscores the volatility in the forex market and highlights the ongoing influence of central bank communications on currency valuations.

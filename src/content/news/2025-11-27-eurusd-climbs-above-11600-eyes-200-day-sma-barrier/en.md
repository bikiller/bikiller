The EUR/USD currency pair extended its upward momentum for the fourth consecutive day, surging past the 1.1600 level to reach a one-and-a-half-week high during the Asian trading session on Thursday. The climb comes amid a weaker U.S. dollar, which has impacted the exchange rate positively for the euro.

Traders are now eyeing the crucial 200-day simple moving average (SMA) as the next potential barrier. The sustained strength of the euro against the dollar suggests a growing bullish sentiment in the market, as investors continue to react to shifts in economic data and central bank policies influencing both currencies.

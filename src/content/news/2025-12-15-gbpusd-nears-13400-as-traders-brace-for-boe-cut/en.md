GBP/USD is approaching the 1.3400 mark, advancing 0.28% during the North American session. This upward movement comes amidst a quiet economic calendar as traders react to last week’s Federal Reserve monetary policy decision, which indicated a potential pause in interest rate hikes. The market is now bracing for possible monetary policy changes from the Bank of England (BoE).

As speculation grows regarding the BoE’s next steps, the exchange rate of the GBP against the USD may experience increased volatility. Analysts are closely monitoring these developments, as a cut in rates from the BoE could further influence the dynamics of this currency pair. With the USD's direction also uncertain in light of recent Fed signals, traders are advised to stay vigilant as market sentiment evolves.

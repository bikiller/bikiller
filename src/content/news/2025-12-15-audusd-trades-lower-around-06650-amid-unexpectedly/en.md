The AUD/USD currency pair has dipped 0.10%, trading around 0.6645 during the Asian session on Monday. The decline comes on the heels of disappointing economic data from China, with the National Bureau of Statistics reporting weaker-than-expected Retail Sales and Industrial Production figures for November. This has raised concerns about demand in the region, which is crucial for Australian exports.

The pressure on the Australian dollar is palpable as traders react to the implications of the data on economic recovery and growth. As the exchange rate shifts, market participants will be closely monitoring further developments from China, particularly how this may influence the broader forex market and the performance of the USD against other currencies like the EUR. The AUD/USD pair's movement highlights the interconnectedness of global economies and their impact on currency trading.

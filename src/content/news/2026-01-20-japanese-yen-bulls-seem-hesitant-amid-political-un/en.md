The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing cautious strength against the US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, maintaining its position near a one-week high. The USD/JPY exchange rate shows signs of hesitation among Yen bulls, influenced by ongoing political uncertainty in Japan as traders prepare for the upcoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) meeting.

Despite the positive momentum, the market remains wary, with participants closely watching for signals from the BoJ that could impact future monetary policy. This hesitation may create volatility in the currency pair as the market digests any new developments, leaving investors to weigh the potential implications for the JPY’s trajectory against the USD in the near term.

The NZD/USD currency pair is under pressure, trading around 0.5630 during the early European session on Wednesday. This decline is largely driven by growing expectations of an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ), which has raised concerns about the strength of the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) against the US Dollar (USD).

As traders adjust their positions in anticipation of the RBNZ's monetary policy shift, the exchange rate has tumbled below the critical level of 0.5650. This sentiment reflects broader market apprehension regarding New Zealand's economic outlook, potentially leading to further selling pressure on the NZD and increasing volatility in the forex market.

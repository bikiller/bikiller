The EUR/USD pair has shown slight weakness, edging lower as it heads into the European Central Bank's (ECB) policy decision. The euro has been consolidating, with the exchange rate reflecting caution in the market. Economic data, including the services PMI and CPI, have come in line with expectations, offering little fresh impetus for the ECB's decision-making.

Traders are now awaiting the ECB's stance on monetary policy, which could dictate further price action. With no major surprises in recent data, the EUR/USD remains range-bound, as investors assess the central bank's potential moves in light of the broader economic backdrop.

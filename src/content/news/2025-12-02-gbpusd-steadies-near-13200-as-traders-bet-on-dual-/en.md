GBP/USD is holding steady around the 1.3200 mark as traders speculate on a dovish pivot from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The US Dollar (USD) has made minimal gains, even as economic indicators reflect ongoing weaknesses that could influence the Fed's decision to ease policy during its December meeting.

This cautious trading reflects broader market sentiments, with the currency pair remaining resilient despite potential headwinds. As traders closely monitor developments in U.S. economic performance, fluctuations in the GBP/USD exchange rate will likely hinge on upcoming economic data releases and central bank communications. The current landscape suggests that the potential for a dovish approach from both central banks may shape trading strategies in the near term.

Silver prices surged over 4% on Monday, pushing the XAG/USD currency pair above the significant $75 level. This sharp increase was fueled by geopolitical tensions following the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, who was reportedly captured by U.S. elite forces on January 3. The crisis in Venezuela has heightened demand for safe-haven assets, propelling silver to new heights.

Traders are closely monitoring this development, which could lead to further volatility in the market. The surge in silver comes amid a broader context of fluctuating exchange rates, with investors seeking refuge from uncertainty in traditional currencies like the USD and EUR. As the situation unfolds, market participants will likely adjust their trading strategies to navigate the implications of these geopolitical shifts.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil saw a modest increase on Tuesday, trading at approximately $60.50, up by 1.35% for the day. This uptick comes amid persistent concerns regarding a potential supply surplus that could weigh on prices. Traders are balancing these supply forecasts with ongoing geopolitical shifts that could influence market dynamics.

The rise in WTI is reflective of a cautious optimism in the energy markets, as geopolitical tensions often lead to volatility in oil prices. As the USD continues to fluctuate against other currencies like the EUR, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rates and their impact on the oil market. With WTI pushing above the $60 mark, market participants will be watching for any developments that could disrupt supply chains or alter demand projections.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) is holding steady just below the 98.50 mark after a 0.5% decline in the previous session. Trading around 98.30 during the Asian session on Friday, the DXY remains under pressure as risk aversion dominates the market. This cautious sentiment is influencing currency pair movements, particularly in the EUR/USD exchange rate, as investors seek safe-haven assets.

Market participants are closely watching the upcoming S&P Global PMI data, which could provide further insight into economic conditions and potentially shift the direction of the USD. A weaker PMI reading may add to the bearish tone, pushing the DXY further below the key 98.50 level. Conversely, stronger-than-expected data could revive the USD, impacting major currency pairs such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD, and USD/JPY.

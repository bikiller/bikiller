The USD/JPY currency pair is trading lower at approximately 156.30, reflecting a decline of 0.40% as of Monday. This downward movement comes after the pair had previously realized some gains, indicating a shift in market sentiment. The decline is largely attributed to disappointing US manufacturing data, which has raised concerns over the strength of the US economy.

In contrast, rising yields in Japan are providing support for the yen, further contributing to the downward pressure on USD/JPY. As traders analyze the implications of these economic indicators, the exchange rate may continue to be influenced by fluctuating yields and broader economic trends. Investors will likely keep a close watch on upcoming data releases that could impact the USD's performance in the forex market.

The EUR/JPY currency pair rose above the 182.00 mark on Monday, as the Euro gained ground against a weakened Japanese Yen. The Yen’s softness followed disappointing GDP data, which dampened investor sentiment towards the Japanese economy. The Euro capitalized on this, recovering from previous losses and pushing the exchange rate to session highs.

Traders have closely monitored economic indicators, and the Eurozone’s upcoming Industrial Production data is likely to further influence EUR/JPY’s movement. A stronger-than-expected report could support the Euro’s bullish momentum, potentially lifting the currency pair beyond the 182.00 level. Conversely, weaker results might prompt a pullback in the exchange rate as market sentiment remains cautious.

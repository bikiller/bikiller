The recent Supreme Court ruling against Trump-era tariffs is expected to provide a slight boost to the USD, positively impacting global risk sentiment. As traders react to this development, the euro (EUR) may face increased pressure against the dollar (USD), affecting key currency pairs. Market participants are likely to monitor the exchange rate closely as this ruling unfolds.

High-beta currencies such as the Australian dollar (AUD) and New Zealand dollar (NZD) could benefit from the improved risk appetite. As the market digests the implications of the ruling, fluctuations in trading volumes are expected, particularly in pairs like EUR/USD and AUD/USD. Investors will be keen to assess how these changes influence broader market dynamics in the coming sessions.

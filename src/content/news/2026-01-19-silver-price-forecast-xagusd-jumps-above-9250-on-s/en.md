Silver prices (XAG/USD) surged to approximately $92.65 during the Asian trading session on Monday, driven by a spike in safe-haven demand. This upward movement comes in response to renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump, which have heightened market uncertainty and encouraged investors to seek refuge in precious metals.

As silver approaches record highs, the implications for the currency markets could be significant. The strengthening of XAG/USD suggests that traders are increasingly wary of market volatility, potentially impacting the USD's exchange rate against other currencies like the EUR. With the ongoing geopolitical tensions, silver may continue to attract attention as a viable investment option amid fluctuating economic conditions.

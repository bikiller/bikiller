The Australian Dollar (AUD) surged to a two-week high following stronger-than-expected inflation data for January, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rising 1.9% month-on-month, surpassing forecasts. This sharp inflationary jump prompted traders to adjust expectations, raising the likelihood of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The AUD/USD pair climbed to 0.6925, up from 0.6830 earlier in the session, marking a significant rebound.

The stronger AUD also put pressure on the EUR/AUD exchange rate, which fell to a three-week low of 1.6060, as investors sought higher returns from Australian assets. The rally in the Aussie was fueled by the market’s shift in focus to tightening monetary policy by the RBA, signaling that further interest rate hikes could be in store. The currency's bullish momentum is expected to persist if inflation continues to outperform forecasts, with the next key technical resistance seen at 0.6950 for AUD/USD.

The Indian Rupee (INR) maintained its strength against the US Dollar (USD) at the week's outset, with the USD/INR currency pair trading around the 90.00 mark. This stability follows the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) strategic interventions in both the spot and non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets, aimed at bolstering the Rupee's position.

As traders monitor the exchange rate, the RBI's actions underscore its commitment to maintaining currency stability amid global volatility. The successful defense of last week’s gains suggests potential continued resilience for the INR, impacting market sentiment and trading strategies in the region.

Gold prices have rebounded to approximately $4,200 per ounce, driven by rising expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December and a weakening US Dollar (USD). As traders anticipate a shift in monetary policy, the potential for lower interest rates is putting upward pressure on the gold market, making the precious metal an attractive option in a fluctuating environment.

Despite the positive momentum, soft physical demand is likely to limit further gains for gold. The current exchange rate dynamics, particularly against the Euro (EUR), suggest that while speculative trading may support prices, underlying demand factors may restrain significant upward movement. As market participants navigate these influences, the outlook for gold remains closely tied to shifts in US monetary policy and currency fluctuations.

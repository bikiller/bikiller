Pound Sterling (GBP) started the week on a cautious note, trading lower against its major counterparts. Despite underperforming against the Euro (EUR) and the US Dollar (USD), GBP showed relative strength compared to its North American peers. GBP/USD dipped to 1.2265, down 0.2% on the day, while EUR/GBP edged higher to 0.8885, reflecting ongoing volatility in the UK currency.

Market sentiment remained subdued, with a lack of significant economic data from the UK contributing to the quiet trading atmosphere. Investors are likely to remain on edge, awaiting clearer signals on the UK's economic outlook, particularly in the context of recent inflationary pressures. The GBP's movement in the near term will largely hinge on external factors, especially US economic data and broader global risk sentiment.

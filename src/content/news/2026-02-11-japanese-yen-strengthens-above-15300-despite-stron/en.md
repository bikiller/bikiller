The USD/JPY pair saw a drop to around 153.20 during the early Asian session on Thursday as the Japanese Yen strengthened against the US Dollar. This shift came despite stronger-than-expected US jobs data, which typically would bolster the USD. The Yen's rally can be attributed to domestic political developments, particularly the landslide victory of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in Japan's elections.

The exchange rate for USD/JPY fell below the key psychological level of 153.00, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment. Traders are adjusting positions amid growing political stability in Japan, which could signal more robust economic policies. As a result, the Yen's strength could continue if momentum builds, potentially leading to further declines in USD/JPY in the near term.

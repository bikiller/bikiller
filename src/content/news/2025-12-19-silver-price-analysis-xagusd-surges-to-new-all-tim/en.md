Silver prices soared to a new all-time high of $67.45 for the XAG/USD currency pair, defying a backdrop of steady US Treasury yields and a robust Dollar. This surge occurred on Friday, with limited market catalysts influencing the movement, aside from the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment poll indicating that American households are reducing their spending on durable goods.

The current exchange rate reflects increased demand for silver, suggesting that investors may be seeking safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. As the market digests the implications of consumer spending trends, traders will be closely monitoring the performance of silver against the USD and other major currencies, including the EUR, to gauge potential shifts in trading strategies.

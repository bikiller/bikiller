The Indian Rupee (INR) has reached a new two-month low against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR pair climbing to approximately 90.90. This decline in the INR reflects ongoing pressure due to significant outflows of foreign institutional investment (FIIs) from the Indian stock market, impacting the currency's performance against major currencies.

As investors react to continued foreign fund withdrawals, the exchange rate dynamics are shifting, making the USD a stronger contender. This movement indicates broader trends in risk sentiment and capital flows, which could have lasting implications for India's financial markets and future currency trading strategies.

EUR/USD is showing slight gains on Monday, hovering around the exchange rate of 1.1650. The currency pair experienced volatility earlier in the European morning session, surrendering most of its daily gains. Market participants seem to be cautious, positioning themselves ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, which is likely to influence trading sentiment.

As traders await guidance from the Fed, the EUR/USD pair appears to be trading within its recent ranges, reflecting uncertainty in the market. The dynamics of the euro against the USD will heavily depend on monetary policy signals from the Fed, which could steer the exchange rate in the coming days. With attention focused on potential interest rate changes, volatility may persist as traders adjust their positions accordingly.

The British Pound (GBP) has retreated from its recent highs against the US Dollar (USD) as traders assess a mixed set of economic data from the United States. Currently, the GBP/USD currency pair is trading at approximately 1.3478, having previously surged to a peak of 1.3518, marking its strongest level since October 1.

This pullback in exchange rate reflects market participants' cautious stance as they digest the implications of the latest US economic indicators. As the trading week unfolds, the GBP's ability to maintain its strength against the USD will depend on further developments in the US economy and broader market sentiment.

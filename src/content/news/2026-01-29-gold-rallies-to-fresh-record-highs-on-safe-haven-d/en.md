Gold extended its powerful advance on Thursday, pushing XAU/USD to fresh record highs as safe-haven demand intensified amid rising geopolitical tensions. The precious metal built on the prior session’s sharp 3.87% gain, reflecting persistent risk aversion in global trading. Heightened volatility across currency pairs continued to drive strong inflows into bullion as investors sought protection from uncertainty.

The rally comes as the USD struggled to attract defensive flows, with the greenback’s exchange rate dynamics offering limited support against traditional havens. While EUR/USD and other major forex pairs traded cautiously, gold benefited from broad-based demand unrelated to yield or interest rate expectations. Ongoing geopolitical risks have reinforced gold’s role as a hedge within diversified trading portfolios.

From a market perspective, sustained strength in XAU/USD underscores shifting sentiment across both commodity and forex markets. If risk conditions remain elevated, gold’s momentum could pressure USD performance further while influencing correlations across EUR, JPY, and CHF pairs. Traders are likely to monitor volatility, geopolitical headlines, and cross-market flows for cues on whether bullion’s rally can extend.

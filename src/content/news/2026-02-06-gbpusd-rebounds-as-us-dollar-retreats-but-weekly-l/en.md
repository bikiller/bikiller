The GBP/USD pair saw a rebound on Friday, rising by 0.60% as the US Dollar reversed course, erasing losses from Thursday. The retreat in the USD was driven by a broader risk-on sentiment, boosting the appeal of riskier assets like the British Pound. As of writing, GBP/USD is trading at 1.3604, with the pair showing some recovery after recent losses.

Despite Friday's uptick, the Pound remains on track to close the week with a 0.56% loss against the USD. The overall market sentiment has been mixed, with the Dollar still holding significant strength due to ongoing economic uncertainties. Traders will be keeping a close eye on developments in US data and risk appetite as the week concludes.

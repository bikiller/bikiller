The USD/CHF currency pair is showing a downside bias, holding below the key technical level of 0.7850 on Monday. The Swiss Franc (CHF) remains under pressure as the US Dollar (USD) recovers from a four-year low. The recovery is driven by market expectations following the nomination of former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair, which is fueling confidence in the Greenback.

With the exchange rate of USD/CHF hovering below 0.7850, the market is focused on whether the pair can maintain downward momentum or reverse course. A sustained break below 0.7800 could signal further downside, while any reversal above 0.7850 could signal a bullish recovery for the USD. Traders are closely watching upcoming Federal Reserve decisions and broader market sentiment for further clues on USD strength.

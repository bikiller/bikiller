The USD/CAD currency pair is on a downward trajectory, extending its losing streak as the Canadian Dollar rallies following a robust rebound in Canada’s Q3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This positive economic data has intensified trading activity, with the exchange rate reflecting a stronger Loonie against the US Dollar.

As traders adjust their positions in response to the GDP figures, the Canadian Dollar has gained momentum, prompting analysts to reassess their forecasts for the currency pair. With ongoing economic resilience in Canada, the USD/CAD could continue to experience volatility, impacting broader forex market dynamics and influencing investor sentiment towards both currencies.

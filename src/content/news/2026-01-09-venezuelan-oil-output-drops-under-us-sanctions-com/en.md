Venezuelan oil production has taken a significant hit due to ongoing US sanctions, dropping to 830,000 barrels per day in December—a decline of 130,000 barrels from November. Despite this decrease, overall OPEC production has remained stable at approximately 29 million barrels per day. This reduction in Venezuelan output could impact the global oil market, influencing the USD and other currency pairs tied to oil prices.

Traders are closely watching how these supply disruptions will affect the exchange rate between the USD and other currencies, particularly the EUR. With oil prices likely to react to the diminished Venezuelan supply, fluctuations could create trading opportunities in the forex market. As geopolitical tensions continue to affect production, market participants should remain vigilant to the implications on crude oil prices and their broader impact on global currency movements.

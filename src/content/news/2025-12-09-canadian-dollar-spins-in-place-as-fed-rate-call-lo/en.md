The Canadian Dollar (CAD) remained largely unchanged on Tuesday, trading in a narrow range against the US Dollar (USD) as market participants awaited the Federal Reserve's final interest rate decision of the year. The exchange rate hovered around 1.36, reflecting a cautious sentiment as traders positioned themselves ahead of the Fed's announcement. 

With the Fed poised to create potential shifts in monetary policy, investors are closely monitoring the implications for key currency pairs, including CAD/USD and CAD/EUR. The uncertainty surrounding interest rate adjustments has contributed to the CAD's lack of momentum, leaving it in a holding pattern as traders anticipate how the outcome will impact market dynamics.

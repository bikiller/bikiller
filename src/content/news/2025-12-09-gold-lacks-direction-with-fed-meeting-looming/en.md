Gold (XAU/USD) continues to trade in a narrow range on Tuesday, maintaining the sideways trend that has persisted for over a week.

Current market sentiment reflects uncertainty as investors remain on the sidelines.

As the focus shifts to the Fed's meeting, the implications for the USD exchange rate are significant. Any hints of a rate hike could strengthen the dollar, impacting gold prices negatively.

The EUR/JPY currency pair is experiencing modest gains, currently trading near the exchange rate of 182.75 during the early European session on Friday. This upward movement reflects a strengthening momentum as the pair holds above the critical level of 182.50, supported by bullish signals from the Relative Strength Index (RSI). 

Traders are closely monitoring this development, as continued strength above 182.50 could open the door for further upward movement in the near term. With the USD remaining relatively stable against both the EUR and JPY, the focus shifts to potential market drivers that could influence the exchange rate in the coming sessions, making this a critical period for investors in the forex market.

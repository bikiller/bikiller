The USD/CHF currency pair is experiencing a bullish trajectory, trading just below the 0.8100 mark during the Asian session on Tuesday. This positions it near a nearly three-week high reached the previous day. The rise reflects a broader risk-on sentiment in the market, supported by a strengthening U.S. dollar.

The dip-buying observed indicates traders are capitalizing on favorable exchange rates amid increasing confidence in the USD. As the pair holds onto these gains, market participants will be closely watching for further developments that could influence its movement, particularly any shifts in economic indicators or geopolitical factors affecting risk appetite.

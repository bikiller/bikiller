Gold (XAU/USD) continued its remarkable rally, extending gains for a sixth consecutive day amid persistent safe-haven demand and a weakening USD. The precious metal surged to a new all-time high during the Asian session on Monday, reflecting ongoing investor uncertainty. As global markets navigate economic instability, gold remains a favored asset, with the price breaking through key resistance levels.

The renewed momentum in gold prices, which have surged over 2% in the past week, is largely driven by the US Dollar's weakness. With the USD under pressure, driven by a combination of soft economic data and dovish Federal Reserve signals, XAU/USD reached new peaks. Traders are closely watching for further developments in US monetary policy, with many speculating that the Fed's cautious stance could keep the USD under pressure and continue to boost gold's appeal.

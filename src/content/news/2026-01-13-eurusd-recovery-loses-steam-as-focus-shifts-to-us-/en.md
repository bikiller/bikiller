EUR/USD is experiencing a lackluster trading session, hovering around the 1.1650 level on Tuesday after retracting from the significant 1.1700 mark. This pullback reflects a shift in market sentiment as traders await crucial economic data from the U.S., specifically the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which could provide further direction for the currency pair.

The exchange rate's current stability may indicate a brief pause in the euro's recovery against the dollar. As the focus turns to the upcoming CPI release, investors remain cautious, weighing the potential implications for U.S. monetary policy. Any surprises in the data could lead to increased volatility in EUR/USD, making it essential for market participants to stay alert to the developments in the economic landscape.

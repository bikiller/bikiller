The NZD/USD currency pair gained some traction during the Asian trading session on Monday, rallying to around 0.5785. This uptick follows the release of China’s trade balance data, which revealed a five-month high in the nation’s trade surplus. Despite this modest recovery, the New Zealand Dollar remains under pressure against the stronger US Dollar.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming US Federal Reserve interest rate decision, set for Wednesday. This key event could significantly influence the exchange rate dynamics, particularly for the NZD/USD pair, as traders assess potential impacts on monetary policy and overall market sentiment. The outcome may dictate further movement in the forex markets, especially with the US Dollar's current strength against various currencies.

Gold (XAU/USD) remains resilient on Wednesday as traders adjust to a dovish outlook from the Federal Reserve. Currently, the precious metal is trading around $4,150, having eased slightly after reaching two-week highs near $4,173 earlier in the day. This stability reflects market confidence in gold as a safe haven amid shifting monetary policy expectations.

The dovish stance from the Fed has prompted traders to reassess their positions in the currency markets, impacting the USD exchange rate against other major currencies like the EUR. As a result, the gold market is seeing heightened trading activity, with investors closely monitoring Fed signals that could influence future monetary policy and, consequently, gold prices.

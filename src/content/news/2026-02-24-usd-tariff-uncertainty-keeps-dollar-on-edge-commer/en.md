The US Dollar’s initial decline following the Supreme Court’s tariff ruling has been largely reversed, with USD pairs returning to levels seen before the ruling. According to Commerzbank’s Michael Pfister, the reaction to the decision is far from clear-cut. Concerns over fiscal issues remain, but these are counterbalanced by the swift imposition of new tariffs, keeping the market on edge.

The mixed response has left USD pairs fluctuating near their pre-ruling levels, with no decisive trend emerging. EUR/USD and other key currency pairs remain sensitive to tariff-related developments, as the ongoing uncertainty weighs on trading sentiment. The USD's outlook depends on the resolution of fiscal concerns and further tariff actions, which could drive volatility in the near term.

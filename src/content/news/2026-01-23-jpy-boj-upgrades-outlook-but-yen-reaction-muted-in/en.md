The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has raised its growth and inflation forecasts, signaling an optimistic economic outlook. However, despite the positive revision, the Japanese yen has shown a muted response against the USD/JPY pair. ING’s Chris Turner highlights that political and fiscal risks are currently overshadowing traditional market reactions, leaving the yen's performance largely unaffected by the BoJ's updated projections.

In the forex market, the USD/JPY exchange rate remains stable, with the yen's weakness persisting. Traders are focused on external factors such as global trade dynamics and Japan's fiscal policies, which are limiting the yen's usual response to domestic economic data. As these risks continue to shape market sentiment, USD/JPY remains within a narrow range, reflecting a cautious approach to trading the pair.

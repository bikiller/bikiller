Gold (XAU/USD) is holding steady near a one-and-a-half-week peak as it heads into the European trading session. The precious metal is buoyed by expectations of a dovish Federal Reserve, which continues to exert downward pressure on the US dollar. Currently, gold is trading around $1,926 per ounce, reflecting a strong demand in the market.

The bearish sentiment surrounding the USD has contributed to gold's upward trajectory, as traders anticipate that the Fed may maintain a cautious approach to interest rate hikes. This situation creates a favorable environment for gold, often viewed as a safe haven during times of economic uncertainty. As the market reacts to these developments, the EUR/USD exchange rate is also being influenced, with potential implications for broader currency pair movements.

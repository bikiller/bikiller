The Indian Rupee (INR) appreciated against the US Dollar (USD) in afternoon trading on Tuesday, with the USD/INR currency pair dipping to approximately 90.08. This upward movement comes amid a backdrop of consistent selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which is contributing to an optimistic outlook for the INR as the year draws to a close.

Despite the decline in the USD/INR exchange rate, trading volumes remain subdued during this period. Market participants are closely monitoring these flows, which may impact future currency movements. The current market dynamics suggest that while selling pressure from FIIs continues, the INR is positioned for potential stability and growth against the USD in the forthcoming trading sessions.

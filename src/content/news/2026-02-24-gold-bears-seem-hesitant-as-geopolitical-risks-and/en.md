Gold (XAU/USD) remains in a slight decline as it trades below its monthly high from earlier this Tuesday, holding steady just above $1,150. Despite modest intraday losses, the precious metal has shown resilience, lacking significant follow-through selling. The price is supported by ongoing geopolitical concerns and expectations of a Fed rate cut, which counteract the upward momentum of the USD.

As the European session approaches, gold continues to face resistance, with the broader market outlook affected by a stronger USD. Despite the pullback, the yellow metal is holding above crucial support at the $1,150 mark, leaving traders cautious in their positioning. The interplay of rising geopolitical risks and shifting Fed rate expectations is expected to keep gold’s price action volatile in the coming sessions.

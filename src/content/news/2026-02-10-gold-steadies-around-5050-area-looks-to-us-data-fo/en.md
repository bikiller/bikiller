Gold (XAU/USD) regained a significant portion of its intraday losses, recovering from a dip below the $5,000 level. However, the precious metal struggled to gain substantial upward momentum during the first half of the European trading session on Tuesday. Traders remained cautious, awaiting fresh catalysts to drive further movement.

Market participants are closely watching upcoming US data, as it could provide the next direction for gold's exchange rate. A lack of strong follow-through buying suggests a hesitant market, with investors weighing the potential impact of economic reports on the USD. As trading continues, any significant shifts in the US data could prompt further volatility in the gold market.

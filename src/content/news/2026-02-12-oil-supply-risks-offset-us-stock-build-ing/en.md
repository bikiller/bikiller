Oil prices have remained resilient, with ICE Brent trading near the $70 per barrel mark. ING analysts, Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey, attribute this support to ongoing concerns over supply disruptions from Iran and OPEC+ production cuts. Despite a significant increase in U.S. oil inventories, which typically signals bearish market sentiment, the geopolitical risks surrounding oil supply continue to drive bullish momentum for crude.

This mix of factors has kept oil trading within a narrow range, with the uncertainty surrounding Iran’s potential impact on global supply outweighing the inventory build-up in the U.S. For forex traders, the continued strength in oil has provided support for oil-linked currencies like the Canadian dollar (CAD), while the U.S. dollar (USD) remains impacted by the fluctuating oil prices, creating volatility in major pairs such as USD/CAD. As long as OPEC+ production cuts persist, market participants will be watching closely for any changes in supply dynamics.

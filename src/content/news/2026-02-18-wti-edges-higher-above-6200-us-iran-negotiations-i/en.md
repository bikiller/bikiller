WTI crude oil prices edged higher, trading around $62.30 during the Asian session on Wednesday. The price remained supported amid ongoing uncertainties in the Middle East, particularly surrounding US-Iran negotiations. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as any escalation in tensions could significantly impact supply concerns, driving prices even higher.

In the forex market, the movement in oil prices is influencing broader trading dynamics. The USD remains a key beneficiary of oil-related fluctuations, with the EUR/USD and other currency pairs responding to shifts in the energy market. As geopolitical risks continue to linger, traders are adjusting their positions, balancing risk appetite with concerns over potential disruptions in global oil supply.

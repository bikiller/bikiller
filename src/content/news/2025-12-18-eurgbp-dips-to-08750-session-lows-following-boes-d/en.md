The Euro continued its downward trajectory against the Pound Sterling, falling from levels near 0.8800 to intra-day lows around 0.8750. The currency pair is approaching its weekly low of 0.8745 as the market reacts to the Bank of England's recent monetary policy decision. The BoE cut its Bank Rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, aligning with market expectations and adding pressure to the Euro.

This decline reflects broader trading sentiments in the forex market as investors reassess their positions following the BoE's announcement. The adjustment in the Bank Rate may influence future exchange rate movements, particularly for GBP and EUR. Traders will closely monitor subsequent economic data releases for further insights into the stability and direction of both currencies in the coming sessions.

In a recent interview with Politico, US President Donald Trump expressed his dissatisfaction with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, criticizing him for failing to implement interest rate cuts. Trump labeled Powell as "not a smart person," indicating his frustration over the Fed's current stance, which has implications for the USD's strength against major currency pairs, including the EUR/USD. 

This commentary comes as traders closely monitor the exchange rate dynamics amid ongoing debates about monetary policy. The market's reaction to Trump's remarks could further influence USD trading patterns, especially if investors anticipate a shift in Fed policy. With the USD facing pressure, traders are assessing potential impacts on demand for safe-haven currencies, as well as the broader implications for global market stability.

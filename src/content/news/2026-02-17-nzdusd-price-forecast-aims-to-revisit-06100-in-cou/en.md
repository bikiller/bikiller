The NZD/USD currency pair is trading slightly higher, approaching the 0.6040 level during the European session on Tuesday. The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) gains momentum ahead of tomorrow’s Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) interest rate decision. Traders are closely monitoring any indications of potential rate changes, which could have significant implications for the NZD/USD exchange rate.

As the market anticipates the RBNZ's policy announcement, the Kiwi is poised to test the key 0.6100 resistance level. Any hawkish signals from the central bank could drive the NZD further, while dovish tones may weigh on the pair. In either scenario, traders will be watching for volatility around the decision as the NZD/USD continues to trend higher in the lead-up to the release.

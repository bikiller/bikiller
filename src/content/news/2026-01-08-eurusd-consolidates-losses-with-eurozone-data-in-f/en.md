EUR/USD continues to consolidate its losses, trading within a narrow range just below the 1.1700 mark for the second consecutive day. The exchange rate has faced pressure as traders closely monitor economic data from the Eurozone, which could influence future movements in this major currency pair. 

Market participants remain cautious as they await key indicators, which could provide insights into the health of the Eurozone economy and impact the EUR’s strength against the USD. With the current trading environment characterized by uncertainty, the outcome of upcoming data releases will be critical in determining whether EUR/USD will break through resistance or continue its sideways movement.

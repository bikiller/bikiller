Gold (XAU/USD) is gaining momentum as it approaches the $4,100 mark, following a recovery from recent lows below the key psychological level of $4,000. The precious metal has shown positive traction for the second consecutive day, driven by a widespread flight to safety amid market uncertainty.

As traders focus on the upcoming FOMC minutes, the implications for the USD and broader market movements remain crucial. Gold's rise reflects growing concerns over economic stability, making it an attractive hedge for investors in volatile times. The exchange rate dynamics between gold and fiat currencies, particularly the USD, will continue to influence trading strategies in the days ahead.

The AUD/USD currency pair is experiencing a pause in its rally, currently trading around 0.6654, just below the nearly two-month high of 0.6650 reached on Tuesday. This stagnation comes as traders await the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision, which is expected to have significant implications for the exchange rate and broader market sentiment.

Market participants are closely monitoring the Fed's stance, as any changes in monetary policy could impact the USD's strength against the Australian Dollar. As the anticipation grows, the trading landscape for the AUD/USD remains uncertain, with investors ready to react to potential shifts in the Fed's outlook.

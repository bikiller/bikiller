Silver prices experienced an upward movement on Friday, trading at $65.76 per troy ounce, reflecting a 0.52% increase from Thursday’s close at $65.42. This rise in the XAG/USD currency pair indicates a growing investor interest in precious metals amid fluctuating economic conditions.

The increase in silver prices may be attributed to a combination of factors, including shifts in the USD exchange rate and heightened demand for safe-haven assets. As geopolitical tensions persist and economic uncertainties loom, traders are increasingly turning to silver as a hedge, which could further influence its market trajectory in the coming days.

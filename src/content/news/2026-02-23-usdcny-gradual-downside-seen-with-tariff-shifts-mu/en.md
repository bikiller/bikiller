The USD/CNY exchange rate is expected to trend lower gradually, as changes in U.S. tariff policies and a weaker dollar provide a favorable backdrop. Michael Wan of MUFG points out that reductions in tariffs on Chinese exports will benefit China relative to other Asian exporters, easing pressure on the Chinese yuan. The tariff shifts suggest a slower descent for USD/CNY.

With the dollar under pressure, the ongoing changes in trade dynamics are likely to push the pair towards lower levels. The expected decline in effective tariffs on Chinese goods supports the yuan’s relative strength against the USD. Traders should monitor tariff developments closely, as further shifts could add volatility and influence the broader Asian currency markets.

GBP/USD advanced during the North American session, climbing to a daily high of 1.3712 before surrendering part of its gains. The currency pair was last seen trading at 1.3655, still up 0.10% on the day. Sterling initially benefited from steady demand, pushing the exchange rate higher against the USD amid relatively calm market conditions.

However, momentum shifted after the release of stronger-than-expected US Nonfarm Payrolls data. The blowout jobs report reinforced the resilience of the US labor market and dampened expectations for imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts. As Treasury yields firmed, the Greenback attracted renewed buying interest, limiting further upside in GBP/USD and prompting traders to reassess short-term positioning.

The robust US data reshaped broader forex trading dynamics, supporting the USD across the board, including against the EUR and other major peers. For GBP/USD, the inability to sustain levels above 1.3700 highlights lingering sensitivity to US macroeconomic surprises. Market participants now focus on incoming data and Fed commentary for clearer direction on the next move in the currency pair’s exchange rate trajectory.

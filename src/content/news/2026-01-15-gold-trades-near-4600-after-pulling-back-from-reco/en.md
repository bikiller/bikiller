Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a pullback after reaching an all-time high of $4,643 in the previous session, now trading around $4,600 per troy ounce. This decline reflects a broader shift in market sentiment as traders reassess their positions amid changing economic indicators and geopolitical tensions affecting currency exchange rates.

The recent fluctuations in gold prices highlight the metal's ongoing volatility, influenced by factors such as inflation concerns and shifts in the value of the USD. As traders navigate these dynamics, the current trading level suggests that gold may continue to grapple with both technical resistance and support as market participants weigh the implications for future investments.

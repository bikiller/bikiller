The USD/MXN currency pair has resumed its downtrend after failing to regain its 50-day moving average. Following this setback, the exchange rate has broken below key consolidation support levels, reigniting bearish momentum in the market. Analysts at Société Générale now anticipate potential downside targets in the range of 17.85 to 17.60.

Rallies in the USD/MXN are expected to encounter resistance around 18.37, which could limit upward movement and sustain the bearish outlook. Traders should closely monitor these levels as they navigate the current trading environment, with a focus on how the exchange rate develops in response to ongoing market dynamics.

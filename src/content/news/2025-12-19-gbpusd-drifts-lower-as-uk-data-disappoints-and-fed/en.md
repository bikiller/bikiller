The GBP/USD currency pair has slipped below the 1.3400 level, currently trading around 1.3370. This decline follows disappointing Retail Sales data from the UK, which failed to meet expectations, putting downward pressure on the pound. Market sentiment has been further influenced by recent statements from Federal Reserve officials, who adopted a cautious tone regarding monetary policy.

As traders assess the implications of the UK economic figures and the Fed's stance, the exchange rate remains relatively stable, indicating a lack of momentum in either direction. The current trading environment reflects a balance between the underwhelming UK data and the Fed's measured approach, leaving market participants vigilant for further developments that could impact the GBP/USD dynamics.

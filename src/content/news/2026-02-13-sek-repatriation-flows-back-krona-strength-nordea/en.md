EUR/SEK has recently dropped to new lows, driven by a strengthening Swedish Krona. This decline in the exchange rate reflects broader market trends, with the SEK benefiting from a combination of a weaker USD and robust repatriation flows. The currency pair's downward momentum signals a growing demand for the Krona, supported by the ongoing shift in global capital flows.

The SEK's bullish trajectory comes as the repatriation flows into Sweden have increased, providing additional support for the Krona. As the EUR/SEK reaches these new lows, the currency pair's technical outlook remains largely aligned with the weaker US Dollar, further strengthening the SEK's position. This movement may continue as long as the broader market sentiment remains favorable toward SEK and global dollar weakness persists.

WTI Oil is trading at $63.90 per barrel on Tuesday, down 0.43% as of writing. The decline follows a reduction in geopolitical risk, with US-Iran talks easing concerns over potential Middle East supply disruptions. As tensions cool, traders are awaiting fresh supply data to gauge market direction. The outlook for oil prices remains pressured, but stabilization could follow depending on upcoming reports.

In forex markets, the oil price pullback has a ripple effect on related currencies. The USD/CAD pair, sensitive to oil fluctuations, saw slight movement as WTI drifted lower. Meanwhile, the EUR/USD exchange rate remained stable, as the focus shifted toward broader macroeconomic data. As supply concerns recede, traders are now turning their attention to upcoming inventory reports to assess the market’s next move.

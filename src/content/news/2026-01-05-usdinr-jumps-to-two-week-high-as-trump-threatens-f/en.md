The USD/INR currency pair surged to a two-week high as the Indian Rupee (INR) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) at the market's opening on Monday. The exchange rate reached new lows for the INR, reflecting a growing investor concern following former President Trump's threats of additional tariffs on Indian goods. This announcement has created volatility in the forex market, prompting traders to reassess their positions.

The shift in trading sentiment is evident as the INR slipped, with the USD gaining strength amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. Analysts are closely monitoring the impact of these developments on the Indian economy and its currency stability. The resurgence of the USD in this context could lead to increased pressure on the INR, potentially affecting trade balances and foreign investments in the region.

EUR/JPY continued its upward momentum for a second consecutive session, rising above 181.50 during Monday's Asian trading hours. The currency pair was seen hovering around the 181.60 level, bolstered by weaker-than-expected economic data from Japan. The country's Q4 2025 GDP growth came in below forecasts, fueling concerns over the pace of economic recovery.

The underwhelming GDP figures put pressure on the Japanese yen, allowing the euro to strengthen against it. As EUR/JPY tests key technical resistance levels above 181.50, traders are closely watching any further developments in Japan’s economic performance and global market sentiment. With the pair now maintaining its bullish tone, momentum could continue if the yen remains under pressure, while any shift in risk sentiment may drive further volatility.

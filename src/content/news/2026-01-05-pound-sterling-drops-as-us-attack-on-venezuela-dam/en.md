The Pound Sterling (GBP) has seen a decline against safer currencies as geopolitical tensions rise following the US military action in Venezuela. This development has soured market sentiment, causing traders to seek refuge in stable assets. The GBP/USD exchange rate fell to 1.2150, while against the Euro, the Pound traded at 1.1450, reflecting growing apprehension in the forex market.

Amid this backdrop, the GBP is proving more resilient against riskier currencies. As traders navigate the heightened uncertainty, the Sterling's movement against the USD and EUR underscores a broader trend of cautious trading. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, with potential implications for future currency pair fluctuations if the geopolitical climate continues to shift.

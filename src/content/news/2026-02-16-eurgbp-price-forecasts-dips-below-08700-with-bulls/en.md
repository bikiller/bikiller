The EUR/GBP currency pair continues to face downward pressure, dipping below the 0.8700 level on Monday. This move follows a rejection from the upper boundary of its ongoing downtrend channel, which currently sits around 0.8720. The pair is now nearing the bottom of last week’s trading range at 0.8685, signaling potential further losses if this support level fails to hold.

As the euro weakens against the British pound, traders are closely watching the 0.8685 mark. A break below this level could accelerate the downward momentum, with the next potential target being even lower levels. The recent pullback highlights the ongoing struggles of the euro amid a generally stronger pound, with market participants cautious on both currencies' performance ahead of upcoming economic data and central bank decisions.

The EUR/USD currency pair is holding steady at the start of the week, with the euro maintaining strength against the US dollar. As of Monday, the exchange rate stands just above 1.1870, showing resilience in the face of market uncertainty. Traders are closely watching developments as the European Central Bank (ECB) and Federal Reserve (Fed) speakers are set to make key remarks that could influence market sentiment.

The market's current firm stance reflects cautious optimism as participants await more clarity from central bank officials. Any comments regarding monetary policy or economic outlooks could prompt volatility in the pair. With EUR/USD holding above the 1.1870 level, traders are eyeing potential resistance and support zones, factoring in the broader market expectations of upcoming central bank guidance.

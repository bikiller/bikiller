The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the USD/CNY reference rate at 6.9590 for today’s trading session, slightly higher than the previous day's fix of 6.9570. This marks a subtle upward adjustment in the yuan’s value against the dollar, as the central bank continues to manage exchange rate fluctuations in line with market conditions.

Traders had expected a slightly lower fix, with Reuters estimating the rate at 6.9517. The minor increase in the reference rate reflects ongoing market sentiment and the PBOC's careful approach to currency management. The market will continue to monitor any further adjustments as global economic conditions evolve, influencing both domestic and international trading activity in the USD/CNY pair.

EUR/JPY is trading around 184.60, up 0.58% on the day, as the Japanese Yen (JPY) faces continued weakness against the Euro (EUR). The pair's bullish movement comes amid increasing uncertainty regarding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy stance, with markets uncertain about the pace of policy normalization in Japan.

This uncertainty, coupled with mixed economic data from Germany, has added volatility to the EUR/JPY exchange rate. Traders are closely watching the Bank of Japan’s policy actions, which will influence the Yen's performance, while the Euro remains supported by relatively stable economic conditions in the Eurozone. The EUR/JPY’s movement could signal further pressure on the Yen in the coming sessions.

Rabobank's Senior Global Strategist, Michael Every, warns that rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could lead to heightened volatility in energy markets. With increasing tensions between Iran, Israel, and the US, the timing of potential conflict remains unpredictable. This uncertainty has the potential to send oil prices swinging, which would have significant ripple effects across global markets, especially in USD and EUR exchange rates.

The volatility in energy markets could influence forex trading as investors react to fluctuating oil prices. A surge in crude oil costs typically strengthens the USD, while energy price disruptions tend to weaken the EUR. Traders should watch closely for any developments, as shifts in Middle East relations could disrupt technical levels, with key support and resistance levels in major currency pairs likely to fluctuate in response.

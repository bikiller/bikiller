EUR/JPY has faced a pullback after two consecutive days of gains, now trading around 184.10 during Thursday's European session. The currency pair, which had seen a rise in positive momentum, lost ground as traders took profits. Despite this, the exchange rate remains in a consolidation phase, confined within a horizontal channel on the daily chart.

The pair's current movement suggests a lack of clear direction, with EUR/JPY holding steady near the 184.00 level. Technical indicators point to further range-bound trading, as the market remains cautious amid broader global risk sentiment. Investors will be watching closely for any breakout above or below this level to determine the next move in the pair.

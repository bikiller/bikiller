Gold surged to new all-time highs above $5,300 on Wednesday, as the US Dollar weakened following President Donald Trump’s comments on its value. When asked in Iowa about the Dollar's strength, Trump stated that its value was "great," which led to a sharp decline in USD. As a result, XAU/USD rose over 2%, trading around $5,290, marking a significant rally for the precious metal.

The Dollar's dip triggered a wave of buying in gold, pushing the currency pair to levels not seen before. As the market digests Trump’s stance on the USD, the price of gold continues to benefit from the Greenback's volatility. With the XAU/USD now hovering near $5,290, traders are closely watching further developments in USD sentiment for any additional impacts on the exchange rate.

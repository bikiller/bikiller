Gold (XAU/USD) has risen to near two-week highs as expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut continue to build. Following a brief volatility episode caused by a CME trading outage that pushed prices lower, the precious metal has rebounded, currently trading around $4,200. This upward momentum positions gold for its fourth consecutive monthly gain, reflecting a strong market sentiment amid shifting monetary policy outlooks.

The growing anticipation of rate cuts has bolstered gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset, driving demand in the face of fluctuating exchange rates. As traders adjust their strategies with the evolving economic landscape, XAU/USD remains closely watched, with potential implications for the broader forex market in relation to USD and EUR movements. The ongoing price action suggests a robust interest in gold as investors seek stability amidst uncertainty.

GBP/USD is trading around 1.3150, remaining subdued for a third consecutive session during the Asian hours on Tuesday. The exchange rate reflects the Pound Sterling's struggle as it faces pressure following UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves' decision to abandon planned income-tax increases. This unexpected policy shift has contributed to the currency pair's lack of momentum.

The reluctance to raise taxes may signal a more cautious approach to fiscal policy, impacting investor sentiment towards the UK economy. As GBP/USD hovers near this key level, traders will be closely monitoring any developments that could influence the exchange rate further, including economic data releases and central bank commentary. The market's response could ultimately shape the direction of the currency pair in the coming sessions.

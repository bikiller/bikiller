West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil prices fell on Tuesday, reversing the modest gains from the previous session. This decline comes as traders responded to reports of advancements in U.S.-brokered peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, which raised concerns about potential increases in oil supply. The latest trading saw WTI crude drop to $78.50 per barrel, reflecting a decrease of approximately 2.5%.

The evolving geopolitical landscape has significant implications for the energy market, influencing the USD and other currency pairs. As traders monitor these developments, the uncertainty surrounding oil supply dynamics could impact exchange rates, particularly between the USD and EUR. Continued progress in these peace talks may lead to further adjustments in crude prices, as well as shifts in trader sentiment across global markets.

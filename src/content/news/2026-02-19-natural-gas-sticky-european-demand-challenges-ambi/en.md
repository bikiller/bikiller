Europe’s natural gas demand is expected to decline only gradually, according to Rabobank’s RaboResearch team. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, demand for natural gas remains high across heating, industry, and power generation. This slower-than-anticipated reduction poses a challenge to ambitious climate targets. As a result, natural gas prices in the region may stay elevated, putting pressure on EUR/USD exchange rates and fueling volatility in energy-linked currencies.

In the forex market, natural gas price fluctuations impact the EUR/USD currency pair, with the euro facing headwinds as energy costs remain persistent. Traders are watching key technical levels for the euro, as any surge in energy prices could push the pair lower. Meanwhile, the USD remains strong, supported by rising interest rates in the U.S. and its safe-haven appeal amid uncertain energy markets. As Europe works to balance energy needs and climate goals, the broader market sentiment may continue to be shaped by these dynamics.

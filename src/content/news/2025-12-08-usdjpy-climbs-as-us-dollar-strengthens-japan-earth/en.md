The USD/JPY currency pair has risen to approximately 155.80, reflecting a 0.30% increase on the day. This gain is primarily driven by a strengthening US Dollar, bolstered by rising US Treasury yields. Traders are capitalizing on the greenback's recovery, which has influenced the exchange rate favorably against the Japanese Yen.

Meanwhile, the recent earthquake in Japan has cast uncertainty over the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy outlook. As market participants assess the potential economic impact, the volatility in the USD/JPY trading could continue. With the US Dollar gaining momentum, the dynamics of this currency pair are likely to remain closely watched in the coming sessions.

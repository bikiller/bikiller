China’s January CPI showed a slowdown, largely driven by base effects from the Chinese New Year. The inflation drop was notably impacted by weaker food and services prices, which pulled down the headline figure. This data points to limited immediate pressure on the yuan, as the USD/CNY exchange rate remains guided by broader economic trends.

Meanwhile, PPI deflation has narrowed, thanks to stronger global metals prices and an uptick in tech-related demand. This improvement in producer prices may offer some support to the Chinese economy, potentially stabilizing the yuan against the USD. However, market expectations for gradual reflation and ongoing policy easing from China will likely continue influencing trading in USD/CNY, with technical levels closely watched.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has dropped to around $66.05, marking a decline amid rising US crude stockpiles. The surge in stockpiles, which signals softer demand for oil, has led to pressure on prices as traders react to market fundamentals. This development has caused traders to recalibrate their expectations for oil demand, influencing broader market sentiment.

In addition to the stockpile buildup, investors are keeping a close eye on US-Iran developments, which could introduce geopolitical risks. As concerns over potential changes in supply dynamics rise, the WTI price has seen downward pressure, affecting the USD and influencing broader trading sentiment. The movement of WTI crude will likely continue to impact the USD’s exchange rate, especially in relation to other major currencies like EUR.

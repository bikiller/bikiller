Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), addressed the market following the decision to maintain key interest rates steady in December. As the EUR/USD exchange rate reacts to the ECB's stance, traders are keenly analyzing Lagarde's insights on future policy direction. With inflationary pressures still a concern, the ECB's cautious approach aims to balance economic growth while ensuring price stability.

Lagarde emphasized that the ECB remains data-dependent, signaling that any future adjustments will be contingent on economic indicators. This steadiness in policy has left the euro trading close to 1.07 against the dollar, as investors digest the implications for monetary policy divergence between the ECB and the U.S. Federal Reserve. Market participants are now closely monitoring upcoming economic data, which could prompt significant shifts in trading strategies for the EUR/USD pair.

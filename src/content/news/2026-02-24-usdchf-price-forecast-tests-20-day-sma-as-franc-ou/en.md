USD/CHF saw a slight decline of 0.20% during Tuesday’s North American session, as the pair tested the 20-day simple moving average (SMA). Despite the US Dollar gaining ground against most major currencies, the Swiss Franc outperformed, keeping the exchange rate under pressure. At the close, USD/CHF was trading lower, highlighting the Franc’s strength relative to the greenback.

The performance of USD/CHF reflects broader market trends, where the USD’s general strength could not prevent the Franc from maintaining its dominance. With the pair now near its 20-day SMA, traders are closely watching for any potential breakout or shift in momentum. A sustained move below the SMA could signal further weakness in USD/CHF.

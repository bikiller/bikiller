The Indian Rupee (INR) traded flat against the US Dollar (USD) in early Wednesday trading, with the USD/INR currency pair holding steady at 83.10. Investors are awaiting developments from the ongoing US-Iran nuclear talks, which could influence global sentiment and impact the exchange rate. Market participants are keeping a close eye on any potential shifts in geopolitical risk, which may drive volatility in the forex market.

The INR's stability comes amid cautious trading, as the USD continues to consolidate around key levels. Despite some fluctuation in global markets, the currency pair has remained within a narrow range, reflecting investor uncertainty ahead of the talks. Technical analysis shows support near 82.80, with resistance around 83.40. Traders are bracing for any potential surprises from the US-Iran discussions, which could dictate the next directional move for the INR in the short term.

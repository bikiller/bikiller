Gold (XAU/USD) surged to a fresh monthly high, posting its strongest-ever weekly close above the $5,100 mark on Friday as investors flocked to safe-haven assets. The precious metal extended its rally at the start of the new trading week, supported by mounting trade war fears, escalating geopolitical risks, and a broadly weaker USD. The softening US Dollar exchange rate has made bullion more attractive for overseas buyers, amplifying upside momentum.

Heightened uncertainty across global markets has driven demand for defensive positions, lifting gold prices while pressuring major currency pairs. The USD’s pullback against the EUR and other counterparts has underpinned XAU/USD, with traders closely watching technical levels above $5,100 for confirmation of sustained bullish momentum. Continued downside in the greenback could open the door for further gains, while any rebound in the USD may trigger near-term consolidation in gold trading.

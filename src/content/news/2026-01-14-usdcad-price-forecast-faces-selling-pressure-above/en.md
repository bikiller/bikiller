The USD/CAD currency pair is currently trading flat around 1.3885 during the European session, facing significant selling pressure just above the critical 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.3900. Market participants are taking a cautious stance as they await key economic indicators from the United States, including the Producer Price Index (PPI) data for October and November, as well as the Retail Sales figures for November.

This consolidation in the exchange rate reflects the market's uncertainty ahead of these important data releases. Traders are closely monitoring these indicators, which could influence the direction of the USD/CAD pair in the coming days. A stronger-than-expected PPI or Retail Sales data could provide upward momentum for the USD, while disappointing figures may lead to further pressure on the pair, impacting trading strategies across the forex market.

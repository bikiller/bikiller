The EUR/USD currency pair is showing signs of potential weakness, with analysts from UOB Group suggesting that while the Euro may dip, it is unlikely to challenge the significant support level at 1.1680. This threshold appears to hold firm in the current market conditions, providing a buffer against deeper declines for the Euro against the USD.

In the longer term, UOB's FX specialists, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, maintain a bearish outlook for the Euro. They indicate that the exchange rate is biased toward a downward trajectory, potentially steering it towards the 1.1680 support mark. Traders should monitor this level closely as it could play a critical role in guiding future trading strategies for the EUR/USD pair.

Norway’s oil investment outlook for 2026 and 2027 is surpassing expectations, with recent data from Danske Bank revealing higher-than-forecast nominal spending. The Q1 oil investment survey showed stronger-than-anticipated figures, especially after adjusting for cost inflation, suggesting that investment volumes will outpace Norges Bank's December projections. The market is reacting to this robust outlook, which has implications for the Norwegian Krone (NOK).

The upbeat oil investment report could support the NOK in the near term, as increased spending signals a stronger economy. Traders are likely to focus on this development, as the NOK/USD exchange rate may gain momentum. Meanwhile, the EUR/NOK pair could face resistance near recent highs, as higher oil revenues could boost investor confidence in Norway’s economic growth, potentially leading to a more hawkish stance from Norges Bank in upcoming policy decisions.

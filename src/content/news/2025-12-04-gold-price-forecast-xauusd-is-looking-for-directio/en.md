Gold prices (XAU/USD) are experiencing slight declines for the third consecutive day, currently hovering around the $4,200 mark. This downturn is attributed to diminished demand for safe-haven assets, driven by an improving risk appetite in the markets. While trading pressure is evident, gold remains supported in the mid-range of the $4,100s, indicating a potential consolidation phase.

Despite the recent losses, the precious metal is still within striking distance of the recent high of $4,264. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics as the interplay between the USD and other currencies influences market sentiment. With the current momentum, any shifts in risk appetite or geopolitical developments could significantly impact future movements in gold prices.

The Australian Dollar remained under pressure following the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Meeting Minutes. AUD/USD edged lower after modest gains in the previous session, hovering around 0.7070 during the Asian trading hours on Tuesday. This subdued movement comes as traders digest the minutes, which did not offer new signals on future monetary policy, keeping the currency pair's volatility contained.

Despite a brief uptick earlier, the Australian Dollar's exchange rate continues to struggle against the stronger USD. The broader market sentiment, influenced by global risk appetite and economic data from the U.S., is maintaining downward pressure on AUD. Traders are now eyeing potential support at 0.7050, with any further weakness likely to lead the pair to test lower levels in the coming sessions.

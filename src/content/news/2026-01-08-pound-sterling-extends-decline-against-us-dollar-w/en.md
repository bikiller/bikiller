The Pound Sterling (GBP) has continued its downward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD) for the third consecutive day, trading around the exchange rate of 1.3450 during Thursday's European session. This persistent decline reflects ongoing market concerns about the UK economy amid a backdrop of rising inflation and interest rate uncertainty.

Traders are now closely monitoring the upcoming US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, which could significantly influence the USD's strength and overall market sentiment.

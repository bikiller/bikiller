The Japanese Yen (JPY) experienced a minor recovery against a slightly weakened US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Monday. Despite this uptick, the Yen maintains a negative bias, reflecting ongoing concerns about Japan's deteriorating fiscal conditions. The USD/JPY exchange rate remains under scrutiny as traders assess the implications of Japan's economic challenges.

Market sentiment around the JPY is expected to remain cautious, limiting potential upside movements. Traders are particularly focused on technical levels, with resistance seen around 110.50 and support near 109.80. As the USD continues to show softness, the JPY's position could shift, but robust fiscal issues may cap any significant gains in the currency pair, keeping the focus on broader market trends and risk sentiment.

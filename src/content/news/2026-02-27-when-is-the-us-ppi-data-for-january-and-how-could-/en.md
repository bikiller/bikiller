The US Producer Price Index (PPI) for January is set for release today at 13:30 GMT, a key economic indicator that could impact market sentiment. Traders will closely monitor the data for signs of inflationary pressure, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s future rate decisions. A higher-than-expected PPI could strengthen the USD, pushing the EUR/USD exchange rate lower, while a softer print might provide some relief for the euro.

Currently, EUR/USD is trading around the 1.0700 mark, with the pair facing strong resistance at 1.0750. A sharp move in the PPI data could trigger volatility, with levels below 1.0650 seen as crucial for the pair’s bearish outlook. On the other hand, a positive reaction could drive EUR/USD toward the 1.0800 range. Investors are advised to stay alert as the release could significantly influence the broader market dynamics.

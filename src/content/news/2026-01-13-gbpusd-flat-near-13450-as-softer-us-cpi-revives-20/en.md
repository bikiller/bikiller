The GBP/USD currency pair is trading flat around the 1.3450 level, reflecting a slight decline of 0.03% on the day. The British Pound has turned negative but remains close to its opening price from Tuesday. This stabilization follows the release of a weaker-than-expected US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which has reignited speculation regarding potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026.

The implications of the soft US inflation report are significant, as market participants weigh the likelihood of a continued easing of Fed policy. This development could lead to a shift in the exchange rate dynamics, with the USD facing pressure. Traders will closely monitor upcoming economic data to gauge the impact on future monetary policy and the overall strength of the dollar against other currencies, including the EUR and GBP.

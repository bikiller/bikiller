EUR/USD remains under pressure, trading near monthly lows of 1.1640. The currency pair is on track for a 0.6% decline this week, indicating a continued lack of upward momentum despite recent positive consumption figures from the Eurozone. 

Market analysts note that strong economic data from the Eurozone has failed to bolster the euro against a resilient USD. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate, as persistent weakness could signal further challenges for the euro in the face of ongoing market dynamics and shifts in investor sentiment.

The GBP/USD currency pair is currently consolidating above the mid-1.3400s after experiencing significant losses over the past two days. During the Asian trading session on Thursday, the exchange rate has remained stable, oscillating within a narrow range, indicating a potential pause in the recent downward trend.

Despite the recent declines, the bullish outlook for GBP/USD seems to hold, as traders assess the factors influencing market sentiment. The stability above the mid-1.3400s could signal a possible rebound if the pair can maintain this level. Market participants will be closely watching for any key economic indicators that could impact the exchange rate in the coming sessions.

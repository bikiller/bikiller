The USD experienced a robust recovery against all major currencies after dipping to a ten-week low. This rebound comes amidst heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly following President Trump's directive to impose a total blockade on all sanctioned oil tankers entering and exiting Venezuela. The move has affected the trading landscape, influencing not only the USD’s exchange rates but also boosting gold and crude oil prices modestly.

In the forex market, the USD's resurgence has implications for key currency pairs. Traders can expect fluctuations in the EUR/USD and USD/JPY as the greenback strengthens. The recent pressure on Venezuela's oil supply adds another layer of volatility, likely impacting market sentiment and further influencing the USD's trajectory in the coming sessions.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil continued its downward trend, trading at approximately $57.70 per barrel during European trading hours on Monday. This marks the fourth consecutive session of losses for WTI, reflecting a broader market reaction to the ongoing peace talks between the US, Russia, and Ukraine. As negotiations progress, optimism around a potential resolution has weighed on oil prices, affecting the overall energy market sentiment.

The implications of falling WTI prices could ripple through the forex market, influencing currency pairs such as USD/EUR. A decline in oil prices often impacts the USD, particularly in relation to currencies of oil-exporting nations. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in the oil market can lead to shifts in exchange rates, prompting adjustments in trading strategies across various currency pairs. The interplay between geopolitical events and commodity prices remains a crucial factor for investors.

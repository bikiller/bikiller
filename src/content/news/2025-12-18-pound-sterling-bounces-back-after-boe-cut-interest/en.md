The Pound Sterling (GBP) saw a notable rebound against its major peers on Thursday, buoyed by the Bank of England's (BoE) decision to cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75%. This move, which was anticipated by the market, was decided by a narrow 5-4 vote, signaling a shift in the BoE's monetary policy stance aimed at supporting economic growth.

As a result of the rate cut, the GBP gained traction against the USD and EUR, with trading in the GBP/USD currency pair showing a positive uptick. The exchange rate is currently reacting to the implications of the BoE's decision, suggesting potential volatility ahead as traders reassess future monetary policy directions in the UK.

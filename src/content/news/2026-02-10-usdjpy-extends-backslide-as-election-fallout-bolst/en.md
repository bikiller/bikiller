The USD/JPY currency pair continues to experience volatility, trading in a range-bound pattern between the January high of 159.450 and the late-January swing low at 152.100. The pair has struggled to maintain a consistent trend, with choppy fluctuations dominating its daily chart. As a result, the exchange rate has remained uncertain, reflecting investor caution and external market factors.

The Yen’s strength has been bolstered by the aftermath of recent elections, which have contributed to a more risk-averse environment. Market sentiment has shifted, with traders adjusting positions and driving the USD/JPY lower. This uncertainty may persist in the near term, with the pair likely to remain within its current range as traders await further developments to gauge the next direction for the exchange rate.

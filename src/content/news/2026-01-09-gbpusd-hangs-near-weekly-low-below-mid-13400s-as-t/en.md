The GBP/USD currency pair is currently trading around 1.3435 during the Asian session on Friday, maintaining a position just above its weekly low. This consolidation comes as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which is expected to impact the exchange rate significantly.

As the market awaits the NFP data, fluctuations in the GBP/USD pair reflect a broader uncertainty in trading sentiment. With the pair lingering in a narrow range, any unexpected outcomes from the US labor report could lead to increased volatility, potentially pushing the exchange rate further away from the mid-1.3400s that have characterized recent trading activity.

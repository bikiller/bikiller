EUR/USD is trading in a narrow range on Thursday, currently sitting at 1.1695, just below the two-month highs of 1.1700 reached on Wednesday. The currency pair's lack of movement reflects a shift in market sentiment, as traders appear cautious amid evolving economic indicators and geopolitical uncertainties.

The exchange rate stability around this level indicates a potential consolidation phase for the euro against the USD. Analysts suggest that any significant break above the 1.1700 threshold could signal further bullish momentum for the euro. Conversely, a slip below 1.1680 may prompt profit-taking, reinstating bearish pressures on the EUR/USD pair.

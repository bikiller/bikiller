The EUR/USD currency pair retreated toward the 1.1700 level on Monday, following a recent peak at 1.1768. This decline comes amid comments from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who reaffirmed a commitment to a stable monetary policy while downplaying the effects of potential US tariff threats on the eurozone economy.

Market analysts at BBH noted that Lagarde's remarks have contributed to a slight shift in the exchange rate as traders reassess their positions. The movement toward 1.1700 reflects growing caution in the market, highlighting how geopolitical factors can influence currency trading dynamics. As investors monitor these developments, the implications for the USD and EUR remain closely tied to broader economic signals and central bank policies.

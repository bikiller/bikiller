EUR/USD experienced a rebound, moving back into the mid-1.16 to 1.17 range as market participants reacted to escalating trade tensions between the US and the EU. This fluctuation in the currency pair highlights concerns over potential tariffs and their legal standing, particularly in light of an upcoming Supreme Court ruling that could influence trade policy.

The renewed focus on these geopolitical issues has introduced volatility into the forex market, causing investors to reassess their positions.

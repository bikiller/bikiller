NZD/USD remains steady around 0.5990 during European trading on Friday, after modest losses in the previous session. The pair has been consolidating within a narrow range, maintaining a neutral bias on the daily chart. The exchange rate is hovering near the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA), signaling a lack of momentum in either direction.

Technical indicators suggest limited movement for the currency pair, as it continues to trade within a horizontal channel. The price action reflects the market's uncertainty, with the New Zealand Dollar facing headwinds against the US Dollar. As market participants await further catalysts, the outlook for NZD/USD remains subdued, with no clear directional bias emerging in the short term.

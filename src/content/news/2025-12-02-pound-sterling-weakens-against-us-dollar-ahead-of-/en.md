The Pound Sterling (GBP) has seen a decline against the US Dollar (USD), trading at approximately 1.3190 during the European session on Tuesday. This drop in the GBP/USD currency pair comes as the Dollar continues to build on its recovery from Monday, despite disappointing ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for November, which typically would weaken the USD.

Market dynamics suggest that the resilience of the US Dollar is momentarily overshadowing the sluggish manufacturing signals, highlighting ongoing volatility in the currency pair. Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming ADP Employment data, which could further influence the exchange rate and overall sentiment in the forex market. As the GBP struggles to maintain its footing, investors remain cautious about potential fluctuations in the days ahead.

WTI Crude Oil has rebounded above $57.00, recovering from a recent downturn that saw prices dip to two-week lows around $56.00 during the Asian market session. As geopolitical risks escalate, the benchmark has turned positive on the daily chart, reaching an intra-day peak of $57.59 just ahead of the US session.

This bounce highlights the sensitivity of crude oil prices to global tensions, which often influence trading dynamics across various currency pairs. As investors react to the shifting landscape, the growing demand for USD in the face of uncertainty may further impact exchange rates, particularly against the EUR and other currencies.

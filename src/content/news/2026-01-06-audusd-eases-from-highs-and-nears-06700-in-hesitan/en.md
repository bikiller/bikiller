The Australian Dollar (AUD) experienced a pullback against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, retreating from its earlier highs around the 0.6740 mark. As the European session progressed, the AUD/USD currency pair settled at approximately 0.6715, showing little change from the previous day's trading. This movement reflects a cautious market sentiment amid fluctuating exchange rates.

Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could influence the AUD/USD exchange rate. The current trading range suggests a consolidation phase, with traders awaiting further signals that could determine the next direction for the pair. With the AUD struggling to maintain momentum, the support level near 0.6700 is now being tested, highlighting the ongoing uncertainty in the forex market.

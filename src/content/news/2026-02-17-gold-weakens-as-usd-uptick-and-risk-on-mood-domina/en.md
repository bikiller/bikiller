Gold (XAU/USD) continued its decline on Tuesday, extending losses for the second consecutive day. The precious metal dropped to the $1,922 level during the Asian session, pressured by a strengthening US dollar and a prevailing risk-on sentiment. Thin trading volumes, exacerbated by the Lunar New Year holidays in China, contributed to the price movement, with market participants awaiting the upcoming FOMC Minutes for further cues.

The uptick in the USD, driven by investor optimism and expectations around the Federal Reserve's policy stance, weighed heavily on gold prices. The market remains focused on the potential implications of the FOMC Minutes for the broader forex landscape, as the USD's strength continues to impact major currency pairs. As traders adjust to the shifting market sentiment, XAU/USD faces challenges near the $1,922 support, with volatility likely to persist ahead of key data releases.

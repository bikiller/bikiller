EUR/USD has retreated to approximately 1.1680 after peaking at 1.1695 earlier on Monday. Despite this pullback, the currency pair remains 0.4% higher for the day during the European trading session. The positive sentiment reflected in the Eurozone Sentix Consumer Sentiment Index has not been sufficient to sustain the Euro's momentum.

The modest decline in the EUR/USD exchange rate underscores the challenges faced by the Euro, even amid optimistic economic indicators. Traders will be closely monitoring further developments as the market adjusts to this latest data, weighing the Euro's resilience against ongoing fluctuations in the USD.

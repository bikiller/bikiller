EUR/USD is trading near 1.1585, showing minimal movement as the market prepares for the US session on Wednesday. The currency pair recently dipped to fresh weekly lows at 1.1565 following the release of inflation figures from the Eurozone, which heightened market sensitivity to economic indicators.

Speculation is building around the upcoming FOMC minutes, which could significantly influence the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as any indications of future monetary policy shifts from the Federal Reserve may further impact the EUR/USD dynamics, keeping the pair vulnerable in the current trading environment.

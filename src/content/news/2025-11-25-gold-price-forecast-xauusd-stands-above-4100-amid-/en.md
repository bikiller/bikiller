Gold (XAU/USD) is trading near $4,100 on Tuesday, maintaining the gains achieved the previous day as market sentiment remains buoyed by expectations of Federal Reserve easing. The stability in gold prices reflects a cautious outlook among traders amid fluctuating economic indicators that could influence Fed policy.

As the market digests potential shifts in monetary policy, the XAU/USD currency pair remains a focal point for investors. Despite slight fluctuations, the exchange rate has held its ground, signaling a possible consolidation phase ahead. Continued Fed easing could further support gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset, particularly against a backdrop of ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflationary pressures.

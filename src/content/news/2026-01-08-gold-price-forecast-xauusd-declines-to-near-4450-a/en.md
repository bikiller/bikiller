Gold prices (XAU/USD) have dipped to approximately $4,450 during early Asian trading hours on Thursday as safe-haven demand wanes. The precious metal is experiencing a pullback as traders capitalize on recent gains, indicating a shift in market sentiment. This decline follows a notable rally, and the upcoming release of the weekly US Initial Jobless Claims data may further influence trading decisions.

As the USD remains under scrutiny, fluctuations in the exchange rate could impact gold's attractiveness as an investment. The market is keenly watching for any signs of economic slowdown or changes in the labor market that could affect the dollar's strength and alter the dynamics of currency pairs involving the EUR and USD. With profit-taking driving the recent decline, traders will be closely monitoring developments that may signal further movements in the gold market.

The USD/CAD currency pair remains in positive territory after modest gains in the previous session, currently trading around 1.3580 during Thursday's European session. Despite these gains, the pair continues to trade within a descending channel pattern on the daily chart, signaling a sustained bearish outlook. The 1.3600 resistance level remains a key psychological barrier, with the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA) near this point providing additional pressure.

The persistent bearish bias reflects broader market sentiment, with traders cautious amid fluctuating risk appetite. The exchange rate's failure to break through the 1.3600 level suggests that downward momentum could resume if the pair fails to push higher. Any significant move past this resistance may indicate a shift in market dynamics, potentially altering the current trading range.

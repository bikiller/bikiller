The EUR/USD currency pair is expected to consolidate within a range of 1.1690 to 1.1770, according to analysts at UOB Group. This indicates a pause in its recent upward momentum as market participants assess current conditions. The analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, suggest that while the longer-term outlook for the euro remains bullish, the likelihood of breaking through the key resistance level of 1.1805 in the near term is low.

As traders navigate this range-bound phase, the exchange rate's stability may provide opportunities for strategic positioning. Factors influencing this consolidation include market sentiment, economic data releases, and potential shifts in monetary policy. With the euro showing resilience, any upward movement could signal renewed interest among investors, while a sustained hold below 1.1690 could prompt a reassessment of bullish positions in this pair.

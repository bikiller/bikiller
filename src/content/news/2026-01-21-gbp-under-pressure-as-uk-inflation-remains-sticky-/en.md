The Pound Sterling is facing pressure as the UK’s December Consumer Price Index (CPI) reveals mixed signals, according to BBH FX analysts. The core inflation rate remains steady, indicating resilience, yet services inflation has dipped slightly below market expectations. As a result, the GBP/USD exchange rate has been defensive, reflecting uncertainty in the UK economic outlook.

This data comes at a time when traders are closely monitoring the implications for future monetary policy. With inflation remaining sticky, the Bank of England may be compelled to adjust its stance, which could influence the GBP's performance against other currencies like the EUR. As market participants weigh these developments, the GBP/USD pair's movement will likely be shaped by broader economic indicators and global sentiment in the days ahead.

The US Dollar (USD) strengthened on Tuesday, recovering from Monday’s losses, following a US Supreme Court ruling against President Trump’s tariffs and a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. The greenback saw notable gains across the board, with the EUR/USD exchange rate dipping below 1.0600, reflecting the renewed optimism in USD trading. The dollar’s move was also supported by expectations of further Fed tightening, which boosted investor confidence.

The Supreme Court's decision against Trump’s tariffs removed some uncertainty, but the new round of tariffs announced by the former president over the weekend is keeping traders cautious. As a result, the USD gained ground, particularly against the EUR, pushing the EUR/USD down to its lowest level since late 2022. Meanwhile, USD/JPY continued to trade in an upward trend, hovering near the 132.00 level, as traders expect further interest rate hikes from the Fed to maintain the dollar's strength.

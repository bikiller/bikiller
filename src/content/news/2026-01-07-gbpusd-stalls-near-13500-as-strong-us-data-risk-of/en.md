The GBP/USD currency pair faced downward pressure, trading at 1.3486, a slight decline of 0.10% for the day. This movement follows a robust employment report from the United States, which bolstered the USD and contributed to a risk-off sentiment in the markets. Earlier, the pair reached a daily high of 1.3517 but struggled to maintain momentum.

With a scarce economic docket in the UK, traders are closely watching U.S. economic indicators that can influence the exchange rate. As the market digests the implications of strong U.S. data, the dynamics between the pound and the dollar will remain critical for future trading decisions. The current trading environment suggests that fluctuations around the 1.3500 level will be pivotal in determining the next moves for GBP/USD.

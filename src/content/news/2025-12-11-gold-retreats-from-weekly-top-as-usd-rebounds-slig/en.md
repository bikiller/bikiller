Gold (XAU/USD) has retreated from its recent weekly high of $4,247, following a modest uptick during the Asian trading session. This pullback comes as the U.S. dollar experiences a slight rebound after a post-FOMC slump, halting gold's two-day winning streak. The currency pair is now under pressure, reflecting shifts in investor sentiment and the overall strength of the USD.

The slight recovery in the USD has implications for trading strategies in the precious metals market. As the exchange rate adjusts, traders will closely monitor further developments in U.S. economic indicators, which could influence the efficacy of the dollar's momentum. With gold's recent highs in the rearview, market participants may reassess their positions amid changing conditions.

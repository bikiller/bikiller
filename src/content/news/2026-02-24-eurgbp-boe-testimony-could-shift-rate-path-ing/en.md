The EUR/GBP exchange rate remains under pressure as traders await critical insights from the Bank of England's (BoE) parliamentary testimony. ING’s Chris Turner highlights that the testimony from four BoE policymakers could influence expectations surrounding a potential rate cut in March. Market participants are closely watching for clues about the central bank's stance on inflation and economic growth, which could sway Sterling trading.

Currently, the GBP/USD pair is trading at key technical levels, with the 1.21 mark acting as a psychological support zone. A more dovish tone from the BoE could push the Sterling lower against the Euro, potentially testing the 0.87 level in EUR/GBP. With the March rate cut speculation, volatility is likely to increase, offering opportunities for short-term traders in the coming sessions.

The US Dollar (USD) struggled to find direction this week, influenced by a mix of geopolitical tensions and uncertainty in local markets. The currency pair EUR/USD hovered around 1.0850, reflecting a lack of conviction among traders as they await crucial inflation data. The exchange rate remains sensitive, with analysts eyeing potential resistance levels at 1.0900 and support at 1.0800.

As inflation data approaches, market participants are keen to assess how it might impact the USD's trajectory. A rise in inflation could bolster expectations for interest rate hikes, potentially strengthening the dollar. Conversely, softer inflation figures may lead to increased volatility in the forex market as traders reassess their positions across key currency pairs like GBP/USD and USD/JPY, both experiencing narrow trading ranges this week.

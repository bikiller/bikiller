EUR/USD demonstrated notable volatility on Wednesday, oscillating around recent highs while maintaining slight gains. The currency pair is currently trading at 1.1670, having reached a peak of 1.1682, marking its highest level in over six weeks. This movement reflects a cautious market sentiment as traders await critical economic data.

China's refineries processed 60.83 million tons of crude oil in November, marking a 4% increase year-on-year, according to Commerzbank. While this figure reflects a positive trend in output, it falls slightly short of October's daily processing rate. The uptick in activity comes primarily from independent refineries, which have ramped up production, compensating for slower output at state-owned facilities undergoing maintenance.

This shift in crude oil processing may influence the USD/CNY exchange rate as markets react to China's energy demands. A stronger crude oil output could support the yuan against the dollar, potentially impacting trading strategies in the forex market. As investors monitor these developments, fluctuations in oil prices could also drive movements in currency pairs like EUR/USD, further reflecting the interconnectedness of commodity markets and foreign exchange dynamics.

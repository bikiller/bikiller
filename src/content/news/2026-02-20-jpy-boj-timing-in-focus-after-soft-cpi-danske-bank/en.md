Japan's January CPI came in at 1.5% year-on-year, with core inflation dropping to 2.0%, its lowest level in two years. This softer inflation reading has raised questions about the timing of the Bank of Japan’s next interest rate hike. Despite robust demand signals from PMI data and fiscal policies, traders are now reassessing the Bank of Japan's tightening plans, which could affect the JPY's performance in the near term.

The yen's movements against major currencies, including the USD and EUR, may be impacted as market participants digest these inflation figures. A delay in rate hikes could put downward pressure on the JPY, keeping the exchange rate range-bound in the short term. With the Fed and ECB maintaining a more hawkish stance, the divergence in policy could widen, adding further volatility to JPY crosses in upcoming trading sessions.

The GBP/USD exchange rate is under pressure following a disappointing UK employment report, according to analysts at Scotiabank. Softer-than-expected job gains and stagnant wages have raised concerns over the UK’s economic outlook, with traders now increasingly pricing in potential Bank of England easing. This has weighed on the Pound, which continues to lag behind its major counterparts.

As domestic risks remain elevated, the upcoming UK CPI, retail sales, and PMI data are critical for market sentiment. A weaker-than-expected inflation reading could reinforce expectations of a rate cut by the BoE, pushing the GBP/USD lower. Current trading dynamics suggest further downside risks for the British currency as the market digests the weak employment data and looks ahead to key economic releases.

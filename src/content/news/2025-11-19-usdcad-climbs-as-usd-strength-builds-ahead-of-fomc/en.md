The Canadian Dollar (CAD) faced pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/CAD exchange rate rebounding to erase all losses from the previous day. As broader strength in the US dollar gained momentum ahead of the upcoming FOMC Minutes, traders reacted by pushing the currency pair higher, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

As the USD strengthened, the CAD weakened, highlighting the ongoing volatility in the currency markets. Analysts are closely monitoring the implications of the FOMC Minutes for future interest rate decisions, which could further influence trading dynamics between the USD and CAD in the coming sessions. The current exchange rate movement underscores the importance of geopolitical and economic factors that continue to shape market behavior.

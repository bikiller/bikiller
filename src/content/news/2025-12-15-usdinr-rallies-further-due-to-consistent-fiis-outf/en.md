The Indian Rupee (INR) has opened the week on a bearish note against the US Dollar (USD), marking a continuation of its losing streak for the third consecutive trading day. As the currency pair USD/INR experiences upward momentum, the exchange rate reflects growing concerns stemming from consistent foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows from the Indian stock market. This trend has contributed to increased selling pressure on the INR.

Market analysts note that the persistent FII withdrawal has raised anxiety about the overall stability of the Indian economy, prompting traders to favor the USD amidst a strengthening U.S. economy. The USD/INR pair continues to test technical resistance levels, with the exchange rate climbing above key thresholds, further solidifying the dollar's dominance in the current trading environment. The implications of these movements suggest a challenging week ahead for the rupee as market participants closely monitor FII activities and broader economic indicators.

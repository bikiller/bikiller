The Indian Rupee (INR) continued its downward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, marking the seventh consecutive trading day of losses. The USD/INR currency pair surged to a record high of approximately 90.70 at market open, driven by persistent outflows of foreign capital from the Indian equity markets. This trend highlights growing investor concerns and the rupee’s vulnerability in the current economic landscape.

The ongoing exodus of foreign funds has put significant pressure on the INR, as traders react to shifting market dynamics and global economic uncertainties. With the USD maintaining strength, the implications for the Indian economy could be pronounced, particularly regarding inflation and trade balances. As the USD/INR exchange rate approaches unprecedented levels, market participants remain vigilant, assessing potential risks and future movements in this highly impactful currency pair.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) has strengthened against the US Dollar (USD), with the AUD/USD exchange rate reaching 0.6622, marking its highest level since October 7. This upward movement comes as traders adjust their expectations regarding potential rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), leading to a more hawkish sentiment in the market.

As speculation grows that the RBA may maintain or even increase interest rates, market participants are reassessing their strategies. This shift in sentiment has contributed to the Australian Dollar's gains, reflecting a broader trend in trading dynamics that favors the AUD in the current economic climate.

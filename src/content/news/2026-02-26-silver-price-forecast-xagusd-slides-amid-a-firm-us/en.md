Silver prices (XAG/USD) faced downward pressure on Thursday as the US Dollar strengthened, following stronger-than-expected US jobs data. This boost to the USD caused the white metal to move in the opposite direction of gold, which held steady despite the broader market volatility. XAG/USD traded lower during the mid-North American session, with the price dipping to around $24.50.

The firm US Dollar, supported by a positive economic report, dampened demand for silver, typically viewed as a safe-haven asset. The exchange rate of XAG/USD was influenced by the dollar's recovery, which benefitted from the stronger-than-expected labor market data, increasing investor confidence in the USD. Traders are now eyeing key support levels around $24.00, with any further signs of economic strength in the US potentially keeping silver under pressure.

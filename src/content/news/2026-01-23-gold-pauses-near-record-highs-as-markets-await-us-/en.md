Gold prices (XAU/USD) paused near record highs on Friday after hitting a fresh peak of $4,967 during the Asian session. At the time of writing, the currency pair trades around $4,938, recovering from a low of $4,899. Despite this brief pullback, gold remains on track to secure its third consecutive weekly gain, reflecting investor confidence in the precious metal.

The current pause comes as markets await key economic data from the US, including the PMI and UoM reports. These figures are expected to influence the USD's performance, with any surprises potentially driving further fluctuations in gold prices. As the dollar's movement remains a key factor, traders are positioning for potential shifts in market sentiment based on the upcoming data releases.

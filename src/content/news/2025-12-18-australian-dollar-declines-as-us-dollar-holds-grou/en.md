The Australian Dollar (AUD) continues to weaken against the US Dollar (USD) for the sixth consecutive day, reflecting ongoing market caution. As traders reacted to recent economic data and geopolitical tensions, the AUD/USD exchange rate slipped to 0.6400, marking a drop of 0.4%. Analysts point to uncertainty surrounding interest rate policies as a driving factor behind this decline.

Meanwhile, the USD remains robust amid a generally risk-averse environment. The stability of the USD has been bolstered by mixed signals from U.S. economic indicators, which have led traders to prioritize safety in their currency positions. As the market navigates these complexities, the AUD's performance could be further pressured, with key resistance levels now defined at 0.6450.

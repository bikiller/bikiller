The US Dollar remains relatively stable as economists unanimously predict no change in US interest rates today, with 92 out of 92 surveyed professionals in agreement. This has led to little immediate market reaction, as traders anticipate a steady policy stance. Despite the stability, concerns linger over potential insurance rate cuts to support consumer spending, which could impact the USD's strength in the medium term.

President Trump's recent comments added a layer of uncertainty, though UBS analysts see limited inflationary impact from his statements. While the remarks may have caused brief volatility, there has been little significant effect on the USD/EUR exchange rate. The focus remains on upcoming economic data and how it may influence Federal Reserve decisions. As markets digest these signals, the USD is likely to stay within current technical levels until further developments emerge.

The AUD/USD currency pair has slipped 0.26% to around 0.6670 during the European trading session on Monday, reflecting a notable decline in the Australian Dollar. This downturn can be attributed to a prevailing risk-off sentiment in the market, which has seen the AUD falter against stronger currencies. 

As investors react to uncertainty, the Australian Dollar struggles to maintain its footing amid broader market pressures. The exchange rate dynamics indicate that the AUD is underperforming against the USD and other major currencies, suggesting further challenges ahead if the risk-off mood persists. Traders will be closely monitoring any developments that could influence market sentiment and impact the AUD/USD pair in the coming sessions.

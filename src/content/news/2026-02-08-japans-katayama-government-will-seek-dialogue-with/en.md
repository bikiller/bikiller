Japan’s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama stated on Sunday that the government is ready to engage in dialogue with financial markets if necessary on Monday. Her comments follow ongoing volatility in the USD/JPY exchange rate. Katayama emphasized her close coordination with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, aiming to ensure stability in the currency pair as traders react to global economic pressures.

The USD/JPY pair has been fluctuating amid concerns over Japan's economic outlook and broader market trends. With the yen’s recent weakness, Katayama’s remarks highlight the government's commitment to managing the exchange rate and preventing excessive volatility. As the markets digest economic data, traders will closely monitor any interventions or signals of support from both the Japanese government and US officials in the coming days.

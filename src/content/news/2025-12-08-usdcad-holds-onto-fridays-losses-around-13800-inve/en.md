The USD/CAD currency pair continues to exhibit weakness, trading around 1.3800 during the Asian session on Monday. This level represents an 11-week low, reflecting a cautious sentiment among investors. Market participants are closely monitoring upcoming Federal Reserve and Bank of Canada (BoC) policy announcements, which are expected to significantly influence the exchange rate dynamics.

As traders remain on edge ahead of these critical meetings, fluctuations in the USD/CAD pair could intensify. The potential for shifts in monetary policy could either bolster the Canadian dollar or further pressure the US dollar, making this a pivotal moment for those engaged in forex trading. The interplay between these two central banks will be crucial in shaping market movements in the coming days.

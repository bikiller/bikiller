DBS Group Research reports that its FX risk score has dropped to the lowest point since late 2021, primarily due to a significant weakening of the US Dollar. The USD saw a sharp 9.4% depreciation in 2025, which has notably impacted its position in the currency markets heading into 2026. This decline is raising concerns about the Dollar's outlook against major pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

The weaker Dollar has led to lower risk levels in global forex trading, with traders adjusting their strategies. The USD's downturn, influenced by a combination of factors including shifting economic conditions, has shifted market dynamics. As the Dollar continues to lose ground, currency pairs such as EUR/USD could see increased volatility, especially as technical levels shift and the global market responds to potential policy changes.

Lower European gas prices have led to a notable shift in LNG shipments from Qatar, with recent data indicating a diversion towards India. Commerzbank's Thu Lan Nguyen highlights that the decline in the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) gas price is reshaping trade routes, as Qatari suppliers seek higher profits in the Indian market. This shift could impact the EUR/USD exchange rate as energy dynamics fluctuate.

As European gas prices soften, traders are closely monitoring potential consequences for the forex market. The demand for Qatari LNG in India could strengthen the Indian rupee against the USD, while the euro may weaken further amid ongoing energy concerns. Investors should stay vigilant for shifts in market sentiment, which could influence trading strategies in the coming weeks, particularly within the EUR/USD and USD/INR currency pairs.

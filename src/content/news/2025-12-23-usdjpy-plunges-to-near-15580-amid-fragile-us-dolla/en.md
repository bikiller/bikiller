The USD/JPY currency pair witnessed a sharp decline during the European trading session on Tuesday, dropping 0.75% to trading levels near 155.80. This downturn reflects the ongoing fragility of the US Dollar, which is under pressure amid concerns about the Fed's monetary policy direction and potential economic slowdown.

Market sentiment has shifted, prompting traders to speculate on Japan's possible intervention in the foreign exchange market. With the yen struggling against the dollar, the Bank of Japan may step in to stabilize the exchange rate. The current trading dynamics highlight the delicate balance between US economic data and Japan's response to currency fluctuations, making this pair one to watch closely in the coming sessions.

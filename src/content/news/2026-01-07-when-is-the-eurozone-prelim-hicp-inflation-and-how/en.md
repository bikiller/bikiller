Eurostat is set to release the preliminary Eurozone Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for December at 10:00 GMT on Wednesday. This key inflation metric is closely watched by traders as it provides insights into the Eurozone's economic health and potential monetary policy shifts by the European Central Bank. A higher-than-expected HICP could strengthen the euro against the dollar, impacting the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Market participants are particularly focused on the implications of these figures for the currency pair. Should inflation come in strong, it may prompt traders to adjust their positions in anticipation of a more hawkish stance from the ECB. Conversely, weak inflation data could weigh on the euro, potentially pushing EUR/USD lower as the USD remains bolstered by ongoing Fed policies. Traders are advised to keep an eye on technical levels to navigate potential market volatility following the announcement.

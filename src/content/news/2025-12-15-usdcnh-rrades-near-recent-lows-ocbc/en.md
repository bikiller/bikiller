USD/CNH continues to trade near recent lows, reflecting broader softness in the US dollar and a lower USD/CNY fix. The currency pair is currently under pressure, with daily momentum indicators suggesting a mildly bearish outlook. As the Relative Strength Index (RSI) approaches oversold territory, traders are closely watching for a potential break below the critical support level of 7.0380.

If the USD/CNH crosses this threshold, it could trigger further declines, intensifying selling pressure in the market. Conversely, resistance is seen at 7.08, where upward movements may face obstacles. The interplay of these technical levels will be pivotal for traders aiming to navigate the current dynamics of the forex market.

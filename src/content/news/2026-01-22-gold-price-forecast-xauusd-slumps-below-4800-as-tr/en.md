Gold prices (XAU/USD) fell sharply below $4,800, dipping to around $4,790 during the early Asian trading session on Thursday. This decline followed a retreat from a record high of $4,888, triggered by US President Donald Trump's decision to ease tensions over potential tariffs on Europe. The announcement coincided with a newly proposed framework for a deal regarding Greenland.

The easing of tariff threats has impacted market sentiment, shifting focus toward riskier assets and strengthening the USD against the EUR. As traders react to these developments, fluctuations in the gold market reflect the broader implications of geopolitical shifts on the exchange rate. Investors will closely monitor further announcements that could influence both the precious metal's appeal and the dynamics of the currency pair.

The Euro (EUR) has strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) following the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to maintain its three key interest rates. This move has helped EUR/USD recover to approximately 1.1756 after earlier sliding to an intraday low around 1.1712. The ECB's stance suggests a commitment to supporting economic stability, which has positively impacted trading sentiment for the euro.

Additionally, easing inflation in the United States has further contributed to the euro's rebound. As US inflation rates cool, market participants are recalibrating expectations for the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. This shift in the economic landscape has created a favorable environment for the EUR/USD currency pair, enhancing its appeal in the forex market.

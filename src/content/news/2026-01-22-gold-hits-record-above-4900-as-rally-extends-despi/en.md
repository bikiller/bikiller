Gold (XAU/USD) continued its upward trajectory on Thursday, reaching a new record high of $4,906, marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. The precious metal's rally persisted despite improving risk sentiment and easing geopolitical tensions between the US and Europe, following a breakthrough agreement over Greenland. At the time of writing, XAU/USD was trading at $4,903, reflecting a 1.60% increase for the day.

The surge in gold prices comes amid a broader risk-on environment, where investor appetite for riskier assets has improved. However, the strength of the US dollar remains a key factor, as gold's gains indicate a shift in market dynamics. Traders are closely monitoring the USD's performance against the EUR and other major currencies, as gold continues to test new resistance levels in this volatile market.

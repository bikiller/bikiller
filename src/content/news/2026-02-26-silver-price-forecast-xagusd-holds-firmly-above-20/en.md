Silver (XAG/USD) is trading in a narrow range around $89.00 during the European session on Thursday, holding steady above the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). This consolidation comes as traders await critical developments from the nuclear talks between the United States and Iran, scheduled to take place in Geneva later in the day. The outcome of these discussions could significantly impact global market sentiment and influence the direction of the precious metal.

The market is closely monitoring the ongoing geopolitical developments, as the US-Iran talks may affect the broader risk environment. A positive outcome could strengthen the USD, potentially putting downward pressure on silver prices, while an unfavorable result could drive safe-haven demand, supporting XAG/USD. As trading continues, attention remains on these political dynamics alongside technical levels, with silver’s ability to stay above the 20-day EMA signaling some near-term stability.

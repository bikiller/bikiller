The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to weaken, slipping 0.1% against the US Dollar (USD) as it reaches new multi-month lows, a level not seen since January. This ongoing decline reflects persistent pressure on the JPY amid shifting market dynamics and investor sentiment.

As traders monitor the exchange rate between the JPY and USD, the weakening of the Yen raises concerns about the implications for Japan's economy and its export competitiveness. Forex strategists at Scotiabank note that this downtrend could influence trading strategies moving forward, as market participants adjust their positions in response to the Yen’s prolonged softness.

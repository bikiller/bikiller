GBP/JPY edged lower on Monday, falling 0.22% as it continues to trade within the 208.00-209.25 range. The pair touched a high of 209.23 before retreating, with traders now eyeing a crucial support level at 207.75. The recent movement suggests a potential breakdown, with a sustained dip below 207.75 likely signaling further downside pressure.

Market sentiment remains cautious, with GBP/JPY impacted by broader risk-off trends and global economic uncertainty. Despite the retreat, the currency pair remains in a consolidation phase, and a decisive move beneath the 207.75 mark could pave the way for further declines. Traders will likely monitor upcoming economic data and global developments for any signs of a clearer direction.

Silver (XAG/USD) remains stable after a minor pullback from the $84.00 level, showing a slight positive bias in the Asian trading session on Wednesday. The precious metal has faced resistance near the $82.00 mark, with bulls appearing hesitant to push further. As the market waits for the release of the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, volatility could increase, influencing silver’s price dynamics.

The trading outlook for silver remains cautious below the key $82.00 level, which has acted as a significant technical barrier. Market participants are closely monitoring the NFP report for potential shifts in US monetary policy, which could affect the USD and, consequently, the XAG/USD exchange rate. A stronger-than-expected NFP figure could weigh on silver prices, while weaker data may provide some support.

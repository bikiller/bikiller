The European Commission's new free trade agreement with India is set to boost the German economy, which has previously had limited trade with the country. This deal is expected to create substantial growth opportunities for German businesses and exporters, strengthening the EUR/INR currency pair. Traders anticipate a positive impact on the Euro as Germany benefits from expanded market access, which could lead to shifts in exchange rates as investor sentiment improves.

In the forex market, the announcement is likely to influence the EUR/USD pair, with potential upward pressure on the Euro against the US Dollar. As Germany's exports to India grow, the Euro's relative strength could rise, especially if Indian demand for European goods increases. Traders should monitor the EUR/INR closely for any breakout above key technical levels, with the trade deal serving as a key driver for medium-term exchange rate movements.

Silver (XAG/USD) has experienced a significant decline, trading at approximately $89.70 on Friday, down 2.50% for the day. This downward movement continues the corrective phase that began after the metal reached record highs earlier in the week. The easing of geopolitical tensions has contributed to the drop, shifting market sentiment away from safe-haven assets.

Additionally, the outlook for Federal Reserve policy is influencing the trading landscape. As expectations about interest rate adjustments evolve, traders are reassessing their positions in precious metals, further impacting the exchange rate of silver. The current market dynamics suggest that silver may face continued volatility as investors monitor both geopolitical developments and central bank indicators.

Silver (XAG/USD) continued its upward momentum for the second day in a row, trading near $90.00 per troy ounce during Thursday’s Asian session. The precious metal's rally is driven by increased safe-haven demand, fueled by growing uncertainty surrounding U.S. economic policies under the Biden administration. Investors are turning to silver as a hedge against potential market volatility.

The ongoing policy uncertainty in Washington has caused a shift in market sentiment, prompting traders to seek refuge in traditional safe-haven assets like silver. With the EUR/USD and other major currency pairs seeing some fluctuation, silver’s resilience highlights investor concerns over the stability of U.S. fiscal policy. As the situation evolves, silver could remain a key player in the forex market, reflecting broader risk-off sentiment.

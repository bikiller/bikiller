EUR/USD is trading near the 1.1800 mark on Friday, recovering slightly from a drop to a two-week low of 1.1765 earlier in the day. The euro has faced pressure as it continues to hold its previous losses, with the exchange rate reflecting concerns over market sentiment ahead of key economic data. 

The market is now focusing on the upcoming US Consumer Sentiment data, which could influence the US dollar's momentum. A stronger-than-expected print may support the USD further, potentially extending EUR/USD losses. As traders await the report, the pair remains vulnerable to fluctuations in US economic indicators.

The Indian Rupee (INR) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, trading at approximately 90.50 in anticipation of crucial trade discussions between the United States and India. This decline in the INR reflects ongoing investor caution as they await developments from the high-stakes negotiations that could impact bilateral trade relations.

As traders monitor the currency pair, the exchange rate indicates a potential shift in market sentiment, influenced by the outcomes of the talks. The results could have implications for the trading dynamics between these two major economies, potentially affecting the INR's performance against the USD in the coming days.

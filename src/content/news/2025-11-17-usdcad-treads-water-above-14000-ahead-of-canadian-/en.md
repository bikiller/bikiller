The USD/CAD currency pair is currently trading above the critical 1.4000 level as the Canadian Dollar shows slight resilience against a stronger US Dollar. The exchange rate has been oscillating within a narrow range recently, with attempts to break lower being supported above the 1.4000 threshold. Conversely, upward momentum appears to be capped as the pair struggles to rise past 1.4050.

As traders await upcoming Canadian Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, market sentiment remains cautious. Most currency pairs are exhibiting similar behavior, trading within established ranges. The focus now shifts to the potential implications of the CPI report on the Canadian Dollar's trajectory, as any surprises could lead to increased volatility in the USD/CAD exchange rate.

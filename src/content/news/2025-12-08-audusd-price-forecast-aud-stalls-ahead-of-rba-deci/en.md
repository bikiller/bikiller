The Australian Dollar (AUD) is experiencing a pullback against the US Dollar (USD) as the AUD/USD exchange rate halts its four-day winning streak. Trading on Monday saw the pair facing downward pressure, largely due to the USD regaining stability in the market. This shift comes just ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) upcoming decision, which is keeping traders on edge.

Despite this temporary stall, the bullish setup for AUD remains intact as long as it holds above the critical 0.6600 level. Should the currency pair manage to maintain this support, there could be potential for a rebound following the RBA's announcement, influencing future trading dynamics in the forex market. The upcoming decision is set to play a pivotal role in determining the AUD's trajectory against the USD and other major currencies.

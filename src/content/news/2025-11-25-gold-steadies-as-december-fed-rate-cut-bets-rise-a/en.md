Gold (XAU/USD) remained stable on Tuesday as market participants adjusted their expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December. This shift follows dovish comments from Fed officials, which have increased speculation about a potential easing of monetary policy. As traders recalibrate their positions, gold prices are poised to benefit from any moves away from a hawkish stance.

The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economy and key upcoming economic data further support the gold market. With the exchange rate for gold holding firm amid rising bets for a rate reduction, investors are keeping a close eye on the USD's performance against other currencies, particularly the EUR. Should the Fed signal a shift toward lower rates, gold could see increased demand, potentially elevating its value in the forex market.

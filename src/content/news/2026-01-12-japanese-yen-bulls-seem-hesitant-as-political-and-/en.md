The Japanese Yen (JPY) showed signs of recovery as it rebounded slightly after hitting a one-year low against the US Dollar (USD) during Monday's Asian session. The exchange rate for the USD/JPY pair reached critical support levels, prompting some traders to capitalize on the Yen's dip, despite ongoing concerns regarding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy and political uncertainty.

Market sentiment remains cautious, with Yen bulls exhibiting hesitation due to conflicting factors. The broader strength of the USD, coupled with doubts about the BoJ's ability to maintain its accommodative stance, continues to overshadow the Yen's appeal as a safe-haven currency. As traders monitor geopolitical developments and central bank signals, the USD/JPY exchange rate may experience further volatility in the short term.

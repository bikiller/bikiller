The USD/INR currency pair opened the week on a bullish note, reflecting a bearish sentiment for the Indian Rupee against the US Dollar. This movement comes on the back of persistent selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which has weighed heavily on the INR. The exchange rate is currently influenced by these outflows, creating a challenging environment for the domestic currency.

Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India's dovish monetary policy stance is contributing to the rupee's decline. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of RBI's approach as it may lead to further depreciation of the INR. As the market adjusts to these dynamics, the USD is expected to maintain its strength, impacting trading strategies and economic outlook in the region.

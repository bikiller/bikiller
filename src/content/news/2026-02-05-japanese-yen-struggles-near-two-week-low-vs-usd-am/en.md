The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling near a two-week low against the US Dollar (USD) as concerns about Japan's fiscal and political landscape continue to weigh on the currency. As of the latest trading, the JPY/USD pair hovers just above 133.50, reflecting a sustained decline. This follows the announcement of Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansionary fiscal policies, which have spooked investors and raised alarms about Japan's financial stability.

The yen's weakness has also been fueled by growing doubts surrounding Japan's economic outlook, particularly in light of the government's substantial spending plans. While the USD remains strong, driven by global risk sentiment and the Federal Reserve's tightening stance, the JPY's underperformance could persist if market anxieties over Japan's fiscal policies deepen. Traders are closely watching the 134.00 resistance level on the USD/JPY chart, as further gains could signal more pain for the yen in the coming weeks.

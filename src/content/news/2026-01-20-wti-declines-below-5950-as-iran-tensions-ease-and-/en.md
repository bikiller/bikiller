West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have slipped below $59.50, currently trading around $59.25 during the early European session on Tuesday. This decline reflects easing tensions regarding Iranian oil supply, which has alleviated some market worries. Traders are increasingly focused on geopolitical developments, particularly the implications of the United States' aspirations concerning Greenland.

As the market digests these changes, concerns over a potential trade war between the US and the European Union are gaining traction, adding further pressure on WTI prices. The fluctuating dynamics of currency pairs, notably USD/EUR, may also influence trading strategies as participants anticipate how these tensions could impact broader economic conditions. The interplay of these factors continues to shape the outlook for crude oil and its associated markets.

Stronger-than-expected US non-farm payrolls have reinforced the stability of the US labor market, according to OCBC's FX strategists Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong. This positive data suggests that the Federal Reserve can afford to remain patient on rate cuts, which limits immediate downside risks for the USD. As a result, the greenback has maintained a solid footing in the currency markets, with the EUR/USD exchange rate holding steady.

Despite this, OCBC notes that structural risks remain, which could impact the USD in the longer term. The recent jobs report strengthens the USD’s position in the short run, but lingering risks, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical uncertainties, could weigh on the currency in future trading. Traders will be keeping an eye on these factors as they continue to shape the USD’s trajectory against other major currencies.

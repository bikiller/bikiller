The USD/CAD currency pair fell for the second consecutive session, trading around 1.3660 during Monday’s Asian trading hours. This decline comes as oil prices rise amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, influencing market sentiment and putting downward pressure on the Canadian dollar.

As the exchange rate hovers near 1.3650, traders are closely monitoring geopolitical developments that could further impact oil prices and, consequently, the CAD's performance. With the market reacting to these factors, the USD/CAD remains sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil, which remains a key driver of the Canadian economy.

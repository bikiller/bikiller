The Pound Sterling (GBP) opened the week on a weak note, trading lower against its major currency peers amid dovish expectations surrounding the Bank of England (BoE). The GBP/USD exchange rate is currently hovering around 1.3600, reflecting a decline of 0.4% as traders react to the prospect of a more cautious monetary policy from the central bank. Meanwhile, against the Euro, the GBP/EUR pair is also struggling, with rates dipping to 1.1700.

This underperformance can be attributed to growing concerns about the UK’s economic outlook, particularly as inflation pressures appear to be easing. Market participants are now pricing in a more accommodative approach from the BoE, which contrasts sharply with the tightening stance adopted by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. As trading continues, the GBP faces headwinds that may complicate any potential recovery against the USD and EUR in the near term.

EUR/USD remained steady on Friday, continuing its range-bound trading pattern observed throughout the week. The currency pair held firm around the 1.0600 mark, as the Euro (EUR) managed to resist downward pressure despite stronger-than-expected US Producer Price Index (PPI) data. The US Dollar (USD) failed to gain significant traction from the PPI results, which showed a 0.4% month-on-month increase, surpassing market expectations of 0.3%.

The lack of momentum for the USD reflects broader market uncertainty, as traders remain cautious ahead of key upcoming data releases. Despite the PPI beat, the Dollar struggled to extend its gains, with EUR/USD holding above the 1.0600 level. The Euro's resilience points to investor confidence in the currency, while the USD's failure to capitalize on the positive economic indicator could suggest broader weakness in the greenback.

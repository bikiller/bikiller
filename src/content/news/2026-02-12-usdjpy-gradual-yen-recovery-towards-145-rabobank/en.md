The USD/JPY exchange rate is facing a gradual recovery in the yen, with the pair edging towards the 145 mark. Rabobank’s Senior FX Strategist Jane Foley suggests that previous assumptions about Prime Minister Takaichi’s fiscal and monetary policy are now being reevaluated. This shift in expectations is reducing the pressure on the Bank of Japan to maintain its ultra-dovish stance, which has supported the yen's recent resilience.

As the market adjusts to these evolving views, the yen’s recovery may continue to gain momentum. The anticipated shift in Japan's policy stance could lead to a more balanced outlook for the USD/JPY pair, with traders closely monitoring further developments for potential shifts in the exchange rate. Any significant moves towards 145 will likely depend on ongoing political and economic signals from Japan.

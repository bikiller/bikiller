The EUR/USD currency pair extended its decline for the third consecutive day, trading down approximately 0.10%. The move reflects a stronger U.S. dollar, bolstered by a robust Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report released by the ISM, alongside an encouraging jobs report. As traders reacted to the positive economic indicators, the exchange rate slipped further, highlighting the Greenback's growing strength in the market.

This sustained depreciation of the euro against the dollar signals concerns about the relative economic performance between the Eurozone and the U.S. The USD's recent gains may continue if subsequent data reinforces the trend, potentially prompting traders to adjust their positions. As the markets digest this information, the EUR/USD pair's trajectory will likely depend on upcoming economic releases and geopolitical developments impacting both currencies.

Silver prices surged to a historic high of $100.33, surpassing the $100.00 mark before pulling back slightly. The grey metal made notable gains of nearly 4% on Friday, following a bounce from daily lows of $96.14. This price movement highlights growing market interest as silver continues to rally amidst a fluctuating USD and changing investor sentiment.

The recent price action underscores silver's strong resilience in the face of broader market volatility. As the metal briefly touched the $100 threshold, traders watched closely for further signs of strength or potential consolidation. A key technical level to monitor is the $100 mark, which may offer support or resistance depending on broader forex movements, particularly in relation to the EUR/USD exchange rate and the USD's fluctuating strength.

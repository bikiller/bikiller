EUR/JPY continues its decline for the second consecutive session, trading at 184.70 during the Asian trading hours on Friday. The currency pair is testing support near the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA), with further downside pressure towards the 184.50 level. A neutral 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading of 55.67 indicates that the market may face limited bearish momentum.

Despite the ongoing pullback, the EUR/JPY exchange rate remains in a mildly bullish setup as the RSI stays above the 50 mark, signaling potential for upward movement. Traders will closely watch how the pair reacts to the 184.50 support, as a break below this level could suggest further losses for the euro against the yen. Market participants are also watching broader market conditions, including any movements in USD and global risk sentiment.

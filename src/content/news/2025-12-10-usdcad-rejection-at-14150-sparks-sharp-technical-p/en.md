The recent rejection of the USD/CAD currency pair at the significant resistance level of 1.4150 has prompted a notable technical pullback. This move has seen the exchange rate drop below its ascending channel and the crucial 200-day moving average (DMA), suggesting a potential shift towards further downside momentum. 

Société Générale's FX analysts highlight that this decisive reversal could indicate a change in market sentiment, with traders possibly reassessing their positions. As the USD faces fresh challenges, the implications for the CAD remain critical, with the possibility of increased volatility in upcoming sessions.

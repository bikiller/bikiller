The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued its upward momentum against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/JPY currency pair extending its losses for the fourth consecutive session. During the Asian trading hours, the exchange rate hovered around 152.90, reflecting the Yen’s strengthening. The movement came as a result of renewed verbal intervention from Tokyo, which has sparked concerns over the growing depreciation of the Yen.

This intervention has fueled market speculation that Japanese authorities may take additional measures to stabilize the Yen’s sharp decline. The USD/JPY’s drop highlights a shift in sentiment, as traders adjust positions in response to Japan’s verbal actions. If the Yen’s strength continues, it could challenge the momentum of the USD, adding further volatility to the forex market.

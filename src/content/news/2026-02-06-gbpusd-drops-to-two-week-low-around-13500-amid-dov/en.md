The GBP/USD pair fell to a two-week low around the 1.3500 mark, continuing its downward momentum for the third consecutive day. This drop follows dovish comments from the Bank of England (BoE), which has weighed on the British pound. The BoE's stance contrasts with the stronger performance of the USD, contributing to the pair’s losses as the US dollar gains traction in global markets.

The exchange rate is now testing key support at the 1.3500 level, a significant technical barrier. With the US dollar buoyed by its robust economic outlook and higher yields, GBP/USD could face further downside risk unless the BoE shifts its policy tone. Traders will closely monitor upcoming BoE meetings and US economic data to gauge potential movements in the currency pair.

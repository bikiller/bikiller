China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) for November rose to 0.7% year-on-year, aligning with market expectations. Meanwhile, core inflation remained steady at 1.2%, and the Producer Price Index (PPI) continued to show signs of deflation. This persistent weakness in domestic demand is contributing to the ongoing downtrend in the USD/CNH exchange rate, as traders react to the implications for economic growth.

As the Chinese economy grapples with subdued inflation and weak demand, the USD/CNH pair is under pressure, reflecting broader market sentiment. Analysts from BBH suggest that these factors may lead to continued bearish trading in the currency pair, which could further influence the USD’s performance against other currencies like the EUR. Market participants will be closely monitoring these economic indicators for clues about future monetary policy direction and potential volatility in the forex market.

EUR/USD is hovering around the 1.1775 mark on Tuesday, having recovered from a one-month low seen last week. The currency pair’s movement reflects a volatile midweek session, influenced by a series of events, including a Supreme Court ruling on tariffs and a packed lineup of Federal Reserve speakers. These developments have contributed to heightened market uncertainty, impacting trading sentiment across global markets.

The Euro has regained some ground against the USD after hitting a recent low, as traders react to the ongoing economic signals from both sides of the Atlantic. The Fed’s speakers are expected to provide further clues on the central bank's stance regarding interest rate hikes and inflation, which could significantly influence the exchange rate in the short term. Meanwhile, the tariff ruling has added another layer of complexity to the broader market outlook, prompting traders to adjust their positions.

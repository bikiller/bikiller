The EUR/GBP currency pair has struggled to maintain its recent gains, as a recovery attempt on Monday was quickly met with selling pressure around the 0.8740 mark. During the European trading session, the Euro depreciated sharply, currently trading at 0.8710, just above a two-month low of 0.8705. 

Market sentiment appears to be shifting in favor of the British Pound as concerns about Eurozone economic stability persist. With the exchange rate hovering near critical support levels, traders are closely monitoring the 0.8700 threshold, which could signal further bearish momentum for the Euro if breached.

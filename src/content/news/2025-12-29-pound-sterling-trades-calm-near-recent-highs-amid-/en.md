The Pound Sterling (GBP) remains stable against major currencies as trading kicks off in the final week of 2025, with the GBP/USD exchange rate hovering around the key level of 1.3500. This steady performance is underpinned by market expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will initiate a moderate easing cycle in 2026, providing a supportive backdrop for the British currency.

Investor sentiment has been buoyed by these prospects, as the BoE's potential shift in monetary policy could help sustain growth amid ongoing economic challenges. As the GBP holds firm, traders are closely monitoring developments in the UK economy, which could further influence the exchange rate against the USD and other currencies like the EUR. This cautious optimism suggests that the Pound may continue to navigate within its recent highs in the near term.

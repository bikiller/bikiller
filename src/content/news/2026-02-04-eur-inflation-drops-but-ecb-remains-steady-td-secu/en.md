Eurozone inflation has fallen to 1.7% year-on-year, driven mainly by a decrease in energy prices. This disinflationary shift has had little impact on market sentiment, as it was largely anticipated by traders. The EUR/USD exchange rate remains steady, reflecting a wait-and-see approach as investors look toward upcoming ECB decisions.

Despite the drop in inflation, the European Central Bank (ECB) is expected to maintain its current stance on monetary policy. Market participants don’t foresee any immediate policy changes, with the ECB remaining on course to navigate the Eurozone’s economic conditions. As a result, the EUR/USD remains relatively stable in the short term, with traders awaiting further signals from the ECB in the coming weeks.

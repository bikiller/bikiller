The USD/CAD currency pair continues its upward trajectory, holding steady above the 1.3650 level as it approaches the 1.3700 mark during the European trading session on Wednesday. This three-day recovery is attributed to a strengthening US dollar, which has gained traction against multiple currencies in the forex market.

Market analysts note that the exchange rate's persistence above 1.3650 signals a bullish sentiment among traders, potentially setting the stage for further gains. As the USD remains resilient, fluctuations in oil prices and economic data releases will be key factors to monitor for their impact on the Canadian dollar and the overall trading dynamics of this currency pair.

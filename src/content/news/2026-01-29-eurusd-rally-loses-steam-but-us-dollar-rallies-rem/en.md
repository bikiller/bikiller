The EUR/USD currency pair is currently trading at 1.1950, pulling back from session highs around 1.200 ahead of the European session's opening. This decline comes after the pair tested resistance near 1.200, but the market remains above the Tuesday lows around 1.1900. The recent rally in the euro has shown signs of losing momentum, though the US dollar's strength has remained somewhat capped.

Despite the pullback, the USD's rallies have been limited so far, as traders remain cautious in the face of broader market dynamics. The EUR/USD exchange rate's movement reflects a delicate balance between the euro's resilience and the dollar's attempt to gain ground. With the pair holding above key support levels, the outlook remains uncertain as both currencies face factors that could drive further volatility in the near term.

GBP/USD is caught in a tight range on Wednesday, trading near the 1.3700 mark as the currency pair struggles to break out of its current cycle. The exchange rate has been oscillating between 1.3700 and 1.3650, showing little momentum ahead of the Bank of England’s upcoming interest rate decision. With traders cautious, the pair's near-term direction remains uncertain.

As the BoE’s rate call looms, market participants are closely watching for any signals that could shift sentiment. The pound’s price action has been muted, with little to drive it beyond these technical levels. The USD remains in focus, with broader dollar strength influencing the trading range. Any shifts in monetary policy or market expectations could prompt a breakout from this consolidation zone.

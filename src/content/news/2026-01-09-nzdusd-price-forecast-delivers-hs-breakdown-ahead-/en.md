The NZD/USD currency pair is trading 0.37% lower, hovering around an exchange rate of 0.5730 during the European trading session on Friday. This decline highlights the significant selling pressure on the New Zealand Dollar (NZD), which is underperforming as market sentiment remains cautious ahead of the highly anticipated US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data.

Technical analysis indicates that the recent movement has resulted in a breakdown of a head and shoulders pattern, suggesting further bearish momentum for the pair. As traders position themselves for potential volatility linked to the upcoming U.S. employment report, the NZD's weakness may continue to influence the exchange rate, drawing attention to how the dollar (USD) reacts in the wake of the data release.

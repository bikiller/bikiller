EUR/JPY remains under pressure, trading around 181.90 during the Asian session on Wednesday, following two consecutive days of losses. The currency pair struggles to regain momentum as Japan’s Trade Balance shows signs of weakening, which has contributed to the softer sentiment surrounding the yen. 

Market participants are now turning their attention to the upcoming German IFO data, which could further impact the exchange rate. Any fluctuations in this data might influence the Euro’s strength against the yen, as traders assess the implications for the broader European economy. As the trading day progresses, the 182.00 level remains a key resistance point for EUR/JPY, while a sustained move below 181.90 could signal further downside risk.

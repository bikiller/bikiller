The Indian Rupee (INR) has continued its downward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD), hitting a record low of 90.30 in early trading on Wednesday. This marks the third consecutive day of losses for the INR, reflecting growing concerns over India's fiscal deficit and significant foreign capital outflows. The currency pair’s weak performance underscores the pressures facing the Indian economy.

Investors are closely monitoring the implications of this depreciation, as the surging exchange rate could further strain inflationary pressures in the country. With the USD gaining strength amid global economic uncertainties, market participants are wary of how prolonged instability in the INR could impact trade balances and investor sentiment moving forward.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil surged above $57.50, trading at approximately $57.65 during early European hours on Monday. This increase comes on the heels of heightened geopolitical tensions, as US President Donald Trump hinted that military action against Venezuela is a possibility. This statement has led to concerns over future oil supply disruptions, which in turn has impacted the market sentiment around crude prices.

The rising WTI prices could have implications for the USD, particularly against major currency pairs like the EUR/USD, as fluctuations in oil prices often influence the dollar's exchange rate. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments, as any escalation in conflict could further drive up oil prices, complicating the current market dynamics and impacting global economic forecasts.

The USD/JPY currency pair is trading at approximately 158.10 on Monday, showing little movement as it stabilizes after retracting from an 18-month peak reached last week. The stability in this exchange rate comes amidst rising political uncertainty in Japan and a broader trend of global risk aversion, which has influenced trader sentiment.

As market participants navigate these geopolitical concerns, the lack of significant fluctuations in the USD/JPY suggests a cautious approach to trading. Investors remain watchful for developments that could impact the yen's value, while the U.S. dollar continues to hold firm against major currencies, reflecting ongoing resilience in the forex market.

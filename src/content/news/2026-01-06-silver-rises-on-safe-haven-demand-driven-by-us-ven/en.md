Silver (XAG/USD) is trading at approximately $78.40, reflecting a significant rise of 2.90% on Tuesday. This increase marks the continuation of a four-day winning streak, driven largely by heightened safe-haven demand in response to escalating tensions between the US and Venezuela. 

The geopolitical uncertainty has prompted traders to shift their focus towards precious metals, bolstering silver’s appeal as a protective asset. As market participants closely monitor the Fed's monetary policy outlook, fluctuations in the USD are likely to further influence the XAG/USD exchange rate in the coming days, potentially leading to increased volatility in the precious metals sector.

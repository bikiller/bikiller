EUR/JPY slipped below 181.50 during Tuesday’s Asian trading session, hovering around 181.40, following two days of gains. The currency pair saw a reversal as the Japanese Yen strengthened, driven by mounting expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) might raise interest rates sooner than anticipated.

The shift in sentiment comes amid speculation about the BoJ’s potential policy adjustment, with traders adjusting positions ahead of upcoming data. The focus now turns to Germany's HICP and the ZEW Survey, which could provide further market direction for the EUR/JPY exchange rate.

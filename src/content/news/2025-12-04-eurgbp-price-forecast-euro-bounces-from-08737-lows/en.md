The Euro has rebounded from five-week lows, trading around 0.8737 against the Pound on Thursday, as the Sterling loses momentum following a recent rally. Despite this uptick, the currency pair remains in a bearish trend, with technical indicators suggesting further downward movement ahead. Market sentiment is also influenced by the UK's budget details, which have bolstered investor confidence.

As the exchange rate of EUR/GBP fluctuates, traders are closely monitoring these developments. The Euro's bounce might provide a temporary relief, but the underlying bearish momentum indicates that the market could test lower levels soon. With investor focus shifting back to the USD and other global economic factors, the implications for both currencies will be significant in the coming days.

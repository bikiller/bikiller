EUR/USD is trading near the 1.1770 mark on Tuesday, reflecting a stable yet cautious atmosphere in the forex market as the New Year holiday approaches. The currency pair remains largely flat in low-volume conditions, with traders awaiting the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes, which could shed light on the central bank's future monetary policy.

The current exchange rate indicates a wait-and-see approach among investors, as they assess potential implications for the USD. With the market experiencing a lull, the focus remains on how the Fed's insights might influence upcoming trading sessions and the overall sentiment in the currency markets. The stability of the EUR/USD pair underscores the need for direction as traders prepare for the potential volatility that often accompanies year-end trading.

USD/CAD firms in Friday trading as the US Dollar regains traction against the Canadian Dollar, supported by easing concerns over Federal Reserve independence. The move follows President Donald Trump’s nomination of former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh as the next Fed Chair, a choice markets view as institutionally credible. The currency pair reflects renewed confidence in US monetary policy continuity.

Additional support for the USD comes from stronger-than-expected US Producer Price Index data, reinforcing expectations that inflation pressures remain sticky. The data beat encouraged fresh USD buying across major currency pairs, lifting the exchange rate against the CAD and weighing on risk-sensitive currencies. In contrast, the EUR and other G10 peers struggled to attract sustained demand during the session.

From a trading perspective, the rebound in USD/CAD highlights how political clarity and macro data can quickly shift forex sentiment. A firmer Greenback may limit near-term downside in the pair, especially if US data continue to outperform. For now, traders remain focused on Fed expectations, relative growth outlooks, and how North American yield dynamics shape USD and CAD flows.

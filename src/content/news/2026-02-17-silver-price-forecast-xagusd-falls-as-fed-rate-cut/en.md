Silver (XAG/USD) is under significant pressure, trading near $73.70 on Tuesday, marking a 3.50% drop on the day. The precious metal's decline comes amid waning expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, despite a cooling inflation report in January. Traders had hoped that softer inflation would prompt a more dovish stance from the Fed, but these expectations remain limited.

Geopolitical concerns continue to weigh on market sentiment, adding to the downward pressure on silver. With the Fed's policy outlook maintaining a hawkish tone, the XAG/USD currency pair faces challenges. The ongoing strength of the USD, influenced by Federal Reserve policies, further dampens the appeal of non-yielding assets like silver, limiting the metal's potential for recovery in the near term.

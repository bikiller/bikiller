The USD/CAD currency pair is experiencing a subdued trading session, remaining below the key technical level of 1.3800. During the Asian hours on Friday, the exchange rate hovered around 1.3780, reflecting ongoing market sentiment influenced by speculation surrounding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. This uncertainty in U.S. monetary policy is weighing on the U.S. dollar's performance against its Canadian counterpart.

As traders digest the implications of these rate cut bets, the Canadian dollar continues to show resilience. The ongoing developments in the forex market could lead to increased volatility as investors reassess their positions. With the exchange rate firmly below 1.3800, market participants will be closely monitoring economic indicators and central bank announcements that could further shape the USD/CAD outlook in the coming sessions.

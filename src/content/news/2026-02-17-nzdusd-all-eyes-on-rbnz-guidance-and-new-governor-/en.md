The NZD/USD currency pair is in focus as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) prepares to announce its first monetary policy decision of 2026. Market expectations are high, with a 99% probability priced in for a hold at the 2.25% Official Cash Rate (OCR). The RBNZ’s guidance will be closely scrutinized, especially as new Governor Breman takes the helm, signaling potential shifts in the central bank’s approach to managing New Zealand’s economic recovery.

Traders will be looking for any signs of future policy changes or forward guidance from the RBNZ, as these could influence the NZD’s performance against the USD. With the current exchange rate sitting under key resistance levels, any indication of tightening or dovish sentiment from the RBNZ could see sharp movement in the NZD/USD pair. The central bank’s decision will play a crucial role in shaping the broader forex market outlook for the New Zealand dollar in the coming months.

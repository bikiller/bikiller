The EUR/CAD currency pair continued its downward trend, trading around 1.6260 during European hours on Thursday. This marks a second consecutive session of losses as the exchange rate slips closer to the key support level of 1.6250. The decline is largely attributed to a recovery in oil prices, which has strengthened the Canadian Dollar against its European counterpart.

As oil markets stabilize, the Canadian Dollar gains traction, prompting traders to reassess their positions in the EUR/CAD pair. With the euro under pressure, the implications of this movement may lead to further volatility as investors closely monitor global economic indicators and oil price fluctuations. The current trading dynamics suggest a potential for continued movement towards the 1.6250 mark, depending on market sentiment and energy sector developments.

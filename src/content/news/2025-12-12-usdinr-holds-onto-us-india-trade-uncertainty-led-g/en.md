The Indian Rupee (INR) continued its downward trend against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR currency pair soaring to a new all-time high of 90.86. This surge is attributed to ongoing uncertainties surrounding US-India trade relations, which have heightened market volatility and impacted investor sentiment.

In addition, India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) saw a notable increase of 0.7%, further complicating the economic landscape. The rising inflation may influence the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decisions, potentially leading to adjustments in interest rates that could affect the exchange rate dynamics in the coming weeks. As traders navigate these developments, the USD/INR pair remains a focal point in the forex market.

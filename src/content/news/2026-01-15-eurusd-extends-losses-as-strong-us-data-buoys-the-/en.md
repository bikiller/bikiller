The EUR/USD currency pair continued its downward trend on Thursday, trading at 1.1630, marking its third consecutive day of losses. The exchange rate is approaching a one-month low of 1.1618, driven by robust economic data from the United States that has bolstered the strength of the USD. 

As the US Dollar gains traction, traders are closely monitoring the implications of these strong economic indicators, which have increased market confidence in the USD. This has put additional pressure on the Euro, leading to further declines in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Investors will be keen to see if the downward momentum can be sustained in the coming sessions.

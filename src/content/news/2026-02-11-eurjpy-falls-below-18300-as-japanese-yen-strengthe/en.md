EUR/JPY continued its downward momentum for a third consecutive session, slipping below the 183.00 level to trade around 182.80 during Asian hours on Wednesday. The currency pair faced pressure as the Japanese Yen strengthened, supported by optimism in domestic economic indicators and expectations of stable monetary policy. Traders noted that the euro remained under mild pressure against the USD, reinforcing the broader weakness in EUR/JPY.  

Market participants highlighted that the Yen’s resilience was driven by safe-haven demand and improved risk sentiment in Asia. Technical analysts observed that breaking below 183.00 could open the path toward 182.50, with short-term trading activity focused on key support and resistance levels. The EUR’s struggle against both the USD and Yen has kept the pair on a cautious footing, prompting traders to monitor macroeconomic signals closely.  

The exchange rate’s decline reflects broader market dynamics, including USD strength and investor positioning ahead of upcoming European data. Analysts suggest that if the Yen maintains its current momentum, EUR/JPY may face further downside, influencing cross-currency flows and trading strategies. Investors are watching how risk sentiment, central bank cues, and EUR-USD movements interact to shape the near-term direction of this key currency pair.

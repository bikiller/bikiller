Japan's exports saw their largest increase since 2022, yet the Japanese Yen remained relatively stable against the US Dollar. Despite the positive export data, the USD/JPY exchange rate slipped slightly, reflecting a muted market response. The pair traded lower, with USD/JPY hovering just below the 132.50 mark, showing limited movement.

Market attention is now shifting towards the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) policies, with traders anticipating potential adjustments.

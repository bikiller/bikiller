Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward trajectory, breaking through the $4,700 mark and setting new all-time highs during the early European session on Tuesday. The persistent fears surrounding the trade war have significantly heightened safe-haven demand, leading to a robust increase in gold buying. This surge reflects traders’ preferences amid ongoing market volatility, as they seek refuge in traditional safe-haven assets.

As gold scales these new heights, the implications for the broader forex market are noteworthy. The rising price of gold often signals a shift in investor sentiment, with traders potentially reevaluating positions in other currencies, particularly the USD and EUR. As safe-haven assets gain traction, fluctuations in currency pairs may arise, indicating shifting dynamics in global economic outlook and market stability.

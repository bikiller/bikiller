GBP/JPY is experiencing significant declines, trading around 212.70 on Thursday, down 0.70% on the day. The Pound Sterling (GBP) is facing strong pressure after the Bank of England's recent policy decision, which took a dovish stance on interest rates. This has led to a marked shift in market sentiment, weighing heavily on the GBP across multiple currency pairs.

The BoE's decision has sparked concerns about the potential for slower economic growth in the UK, driving the Pound lower against the Japanese Yen. As GBP/JPY struggles to maintain its footing, traders are closely monitoring further developments in both the UK and global economies, with additional volatility expected in the coming sessions. The exchange rate remains sensitive to any shifts in market expectations surrounding future BoE actions.

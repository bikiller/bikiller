WTI crude oil prices declined on Tuesday, trading around $62.50, marking a 1.80% drop on the day. The retreat comes as US-Iran nuclear talks and rumors surrounding OPEC+ production levels put a cap on potential gains. Despite this, the price remains within the narrow trading range observed in recent weeks, reflecting uncertainty in the oil market.

The ongoing discussions between the US and Iran, along with speculations over OPEC+'s output strategy, are keeping traders cautious. These developments are influencing the broader market sentiment, particularly in USD-related currency pairs. As the situation evolves, traders are closely monitoring potential shifts in oil supply dynamics, which could further impact the price movement in the coming days.

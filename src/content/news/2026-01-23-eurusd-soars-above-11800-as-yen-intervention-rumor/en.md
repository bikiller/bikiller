EUR/USD surged above the 1.1800 mark late in the North American session on Friday, driven by rumors that Japanese authorities were preparing to intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the Yen. The speculation sent the US Dollar (USD) tumbling, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) showing a sharp decline of over 0.70% on the day.

This sudden drop in the USD helped push the EUR/USD exchange rate higher, as traders reacted to the possibility of increased market intervention. With the pair climbing above key technical levels, the move underscores the ongoing volatility in forex markets, with investors closely monitoring any official announcements related to the Yen's support.

The Euro (EUR) has seen a sharp 4% rally against the US Dollar (USD) in just under two weeks, pushing the EUR/USD exchange rate above the 1.20 mark. This rapid appreciation has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike, signaling strong bullish momentum for the single currency. Despite this movement, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown concern but is unlikely to adjust its monetary policy in response.

The ECB has expressed its unease about the Euro's swift rise, acknowledging the potential challenges for exporters and the broader economy. However, given the current economic landscape and its commitment to maintaining accommodative monetary policy, the ECB seems poised to let the currency's upward trajectory continue, at least for now. Market participants will closely monitor any comments from the ECB in the coming weeks, but intervention remains unlikely at this stage.

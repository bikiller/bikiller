The Australian Dollar edges lower against the US Dollar on Wednesday, with the AUD/USD currency pair giving back ground after posting gains of more than 1% in the previous session. The pullback reflects a rebound in the USD as traders reposition ahead of the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy decision, prompting a more cautious tone across FX markets.

In early trading, the exchange rate drifted lower as demand for the US Dollar firmed, driven by expectations that the Fed will maintain a restrictive stance for longer. The shift in sentiment has weighed on risk-sensitive currencies like the AUD, even as recent momentum highlighted short-term buying interest following Tuesday’s strong advance.

For forex trading, the renewed strength in the USD signals potential near-term pressure on AUD/USD, while also influencing broader majors such as EUR/USD. With volatility likely to rise around Fed communication, market participants are closely watching how policy guidance may reshape capital flows, risk appetite, and directional bias across major currency pairs in the days ahead.

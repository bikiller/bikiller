EUR/JPY continued its downward trend for the second consecutive session, trading at around 182.90 during Monday’s Asian hours. The currency pair, which had previously hovered near 183.00, is now under pressure as the Japanese Yen strengthens. Speculation over potential intervention by Japanese authorities is fueling this shift, prompting a retreat in the EUR/JPY exchange rate.

The yen’s upward momentum comes amid increased market concerns over Japan's response to its currency's weakening. As EUR/JPY falls below key support levels, traders are closely watching for any signs of intervention from the Bank of Japan to stabilize the exchange rate. This heightened uncertainty is likely to keep the pair volatile in the short term, with 182.50 as the next potential support level to watch.

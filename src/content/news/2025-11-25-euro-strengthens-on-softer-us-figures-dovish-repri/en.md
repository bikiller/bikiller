The Euro strengthened significantly against the US Dollar on Tuesday, with the EUR/USD currency pair gaining over 0.51% to trade at 1.1579. This upward movement was driven by disappointing US economic data, which fueled speculation among traders that the Federal Reserve may consider reducing interest rates at its upcoming December meeting.

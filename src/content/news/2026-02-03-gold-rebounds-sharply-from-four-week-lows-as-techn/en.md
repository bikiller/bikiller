Gold (XAU/USD) surged over 5% on Tuesday, recovering from recent losses after hitting a four-week low near $4,402 on Monday. The rally comes as dip buyers re-enter the market, capitalizing on the steep correction from last week’s record highs of around $5,600. At the time of writing, the XAU/USD pair is trading near $4,915, signaling a strong rebound in the precious metal.

The sharp recovery reflects technical buying momentum, as traders look to exploit oversold conditions. Despite the volatile fluctuations, the market remains sensitive to global risk sentiment and USD strength, factors that have played a significant role in recent price movements. As the exchange rate stabilizes, attention will be on upcoming market data to gauge the sustainability of gold’s rebound in the near term.

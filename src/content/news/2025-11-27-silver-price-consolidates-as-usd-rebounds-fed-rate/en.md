Silver (XAG/USD) is experiencing mild downward pressure, currently trading at $53.25, reflecting a decrease of 0.15% for the day. This consolidation comes as the US dollar (USD) shows signs of rebounding, influencing the exchange rate dynamics in the precious metals market. The trading activity remains subdued due to the thin liquidity typically associated with the US Thanksgiving holiday.

Market participants are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's outlook on interest rates, as expectations of potential rate cuts continue to support demand for silver. The interplay between the USD's strength and investor sentiment surrounding monetary policy is likely to keep the price of silver within its current range until broader market catalysts emerge.

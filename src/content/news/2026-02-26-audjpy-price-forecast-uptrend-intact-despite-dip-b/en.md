The AUD/JPY currency pair saw a pause in its recent rally on Thursday, dipping by 0.40% as the Japanese Yen gained strength across the market. This retreat pushed the exchange rate below the 111.00 mark, signaling some short-term weakness. Despite this pullback, the pair's broader uptrend remains intact, with traders eyeing potential support levels for a rebound.

The decline was largely driven by hawkish remarks from two Bank of Japan officials, which weighed on investor sentiment. Their comments reinforced expectations of a more aggressive monetary policy stance, further boosting the Yen's appeal. As of writing, AUD/JPY trades below 111.00, but any sustained weakness will be closely watched for signs of a deeper correction or renewed bullish momentum.

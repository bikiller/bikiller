EUR/CAD has climbed above the 1.6200 level, continuing its upward momentum for the second consecutive session. Trading around 1.6210 during European hours on Monday, the currency pair is benefiting from growing investor confidence in the Euro (EUR) as the European Central Bank (ECB) signals it may be nearing the end of its rate-cutting cycle.

This movement highlights a stabilization in the eurozone, which is bolstering the exchange rate against the Canadian dollar (CAD). As the market digests the ECB's position, traders are closely monitoring any further developments that could influence the EUR, especially in relation to other major currencies like the USD. The ongoing trends suggest a cautious optimism surrounding the EUR's future performance.

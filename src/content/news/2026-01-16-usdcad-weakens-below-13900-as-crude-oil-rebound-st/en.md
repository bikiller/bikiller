The USD/CAD currency pair weakened, trading around 1.3890 during the Asian session on Friday. This decline was primarily driven by a resurgence in crude oil prices, which bolstered the Canadian Dollar (CAD) against the US Dollar (USD). As oil often impacts the Canadian economy due to its export reliance, the rebound has significantly influenced the exchange rate.

Market participants are now looking ahead to the US December Industrial Production report and upcoming comments from Federal Reserve officials later in the day. These economic indicators are expected to provide further insights into the US economic outlook and could influence trading strategies in the USD/CAD pair, as traders assess potential shifts in monetary policy and its impact on the exchange rate.

EUR/USD has shown resilience, emerging from recent lows in a quiet year-end trading session. The currency pair found solid support at 1.1720 during the European morning, which helped it regain momentum. Heading into the US session, EUR/USD is trading above 1.1750, reflecting a slight bullish sentiment.

The movement in the exchange rate can be attributed to a combination of market positioning and low liquidity typical of this time of year. As traders adjust their positions, the EUR has gained traction against the USD. This shift could signal potential for further gains, especially if the upward momentum continues as liquidity improves in the New Year.

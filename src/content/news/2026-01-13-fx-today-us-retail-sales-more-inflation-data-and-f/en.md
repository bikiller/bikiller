The US Dollar (USD) strengthened on Tuesday, reversing the previous day's losses as traders digested the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and braced for additional inflation indicators. This renewed confidence in the USD was evident in the EUR/USD exchange rate, which dipped to 1.0800, reflecting the market's shifting sentiment as investors seek guidance from upcoming Retail Sales figures.

As market participants anticipate comments from Federal Reserve officials, the implications of these economic releases could further influence trading dynamics. A solid performance in US Retail Sales could reinforce the USD's upward trajectory, while any unexpected inflation data may prompt volatility across currency pairs, particularly against the euro (EUR) and Japanese yen (JPY). The continuing focus on inflation underscores the market's sensitivity to economic signals, with traders ready to adjust positions in response to forthcoming data.

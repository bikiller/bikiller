EUR/USD has dropped to fresh weekly lows of 1.1565 after encountering resistance near the 1.1600 level once again. This downward movement followed the release of inflation data from the Eurozone, which did not meet market expectations. As traders reacted to the figures, the euro weakened against the dollar, causing a shift in the exchange rate dynamics.

The disappointing inflation figures have raised concerns about the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy stance, potentially leading to a more cautious approach in upcoming meetings. This sentiment further pressured the EUR/USD currency pair, highlighting the ongoing volatility in the forex market. As traders assess the implications of these economic indicators, the focus remains on how they will influence future trading strategies and market trends.

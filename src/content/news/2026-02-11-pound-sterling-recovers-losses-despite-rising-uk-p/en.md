Pound Sterling (GBP) has shown resilience against the US Dollar (USD), recovering losses from the previous session. During the Asian trading hours on Wednesday, GBP/USD was seen trading around 1.3650, gaining momentum despite mounting political uncertainties in the UK. The currency pair's recovery comes amid market concerns over rising risks surrounding domestic political developments.

The recovery is notable as GBP faces downward pressure from ongoing speculation of a potential rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE). With traders adjusting their positions, the pound's positive movement against the USD highlights a complex market environment, where short-term volatility is driven by both domestic factors and global market dynamics. GBP/USD’s near-term outlook remains highly sensitive to these risks.

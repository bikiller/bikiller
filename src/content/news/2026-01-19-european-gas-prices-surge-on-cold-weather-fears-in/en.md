European gas prices surged on Friday as the TTF index soared more than 11%, reaching its highest close since June. This increase is driven by concerns over low storage levels and forecasts of colder weather across the region. Market analysts from ING, Ewa Manthey and Warren Patterson, emphasize that these conditions heighten the urgency for energy supplies, influencing trading dynamics in related currency pairs.

The rally in gas prices could have broader implications for the forex market, particularly for the EUR/USD exchange rate. As energy costs rise, the euro may face downward pressure against the USD, as higher gas prices can impact economic growth and inflation in the Eurozone. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in gas prices could lead to increased volatility in European currencies.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) rose 0.15%, reaching 97.85 during the European trading session on Tuesday. The index, which tracks the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is gaining momentum ahead of the US market open. A stronger dollar is supported by market anticipation surrounding upcoming Federal Reserve speeches, which could provide fresh insights into future monetary policy.

As the greenback strengthens, currency pairs such as EUR/USD are seeing downward pressure. The exchange rate between the Euro and the Dollar continues to hover around key technical levels, reflecting market sentiment. Traders are closely watching any statements from Fed officials, as signals on interest rate hikes could further influence USD performance and broader market sentiment.

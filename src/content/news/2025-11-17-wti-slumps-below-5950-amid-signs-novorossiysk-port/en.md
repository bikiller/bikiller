West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a key benchmark for US crude oil, has fallen below $59.50, currently trading at approximately $59.35 during the Asian trading session on Monday. This decline can be attributed to indications that operations are resuming at the Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea, a critical hub for Russian oil exports. As trading unfolds, market sentiment appears to lean toward increased supply concerns, contributing to downward pressure on prices.

The reopening of Novorossiysk may lead to a shift in the supply dynamics within the global oil market, potentially influencing exchange rates across various currency pairs. Traders are closely monitoring this development, which could affect the USD's strength against currencies like the EUR. The oil market's fluctuations continue to impact broader economic indicators, highlighting the interconnectedness of crude oil prices and currency valuations in today’s trading landscape.

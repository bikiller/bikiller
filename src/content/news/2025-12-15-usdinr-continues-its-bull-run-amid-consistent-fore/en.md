The USD/INR currency pair continues its bullish momentum as the Indian Rupee (INR) faces downward pressure, marking its third consecutive day of losses against the US Dollar (USD). Amid consistent foreign outflows from India, the exchange rate has shown significant volatility, reflecting broader market sentiments and economic anxieties. 

As foreign investors withdraw capital, the INR's weakness is amplified, with the pair trading at elevated levels. This downward trend raises concerns over the potential impact on India's economy, as sustained INR depreciation could affect import costs and inflation. Traders are closely monitoring key technical levels, anticipating further developments that could shape the currency pair's trajectory in the coming days.

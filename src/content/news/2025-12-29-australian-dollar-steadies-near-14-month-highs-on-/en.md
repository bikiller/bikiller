The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, holding steady near a 14-month high at an exchange rate of 0.6724, a level last seen on December 26. This upward movement is largely fueled by rising expectations of a potential interest rate hike from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has bolstered market sentiment surrounding the currency pair.

As traders anticipate tighter monetary policy, the AUD's gains reflect broader confidence in the Australian economy. The sustained momentum near this technical level indicates a strong position for the AUD, potentially attracting further investment and influencing trading strategies in the currency markets. Meanwhile, the USD continues to be pressured as traders weigh future Federal Reserve actions against the backdrop of the evolving economic landscape.

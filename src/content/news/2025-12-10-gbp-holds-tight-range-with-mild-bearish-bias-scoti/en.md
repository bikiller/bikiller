Pound Sterling (GBP) is currently trading in a tight range, showing a mild bearish bias as it drifts down from last week’s highs. The currency pair is approaching the key support level at 1.33, with traders anticipating potential volatility ahead of this Friday’s domestic data releases. The lack of significant domestic risk is contributing to the GBP's restrained movement.

Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, suggest that the exchange rate may remain subdued until the market has digested the upcoming economic indicators. As market participants closely watch for these data points, the GBP's trajectory against the USD and EUR may shift, impacting broader trading strategies in the forex market.

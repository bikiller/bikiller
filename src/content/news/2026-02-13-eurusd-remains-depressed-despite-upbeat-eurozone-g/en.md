EUR/USD extended its downward trend for a fourth straight day, trading just below 1.1860 on Friday. The currency pair has retreated from a weekly high of 1.1928, despite positive GDP data from the Eurozone. The better-than-expected economic growth in the bloc failed to lift the Euro, as the US Dollar remains supported by stronger investor sentiment and ongoing demand for safe-haven assets.

The EUR/USD exchange rate's bearish momentum suggests continued pressure on the Euro, with the pair unable to break past key resistance levels. Traders are now watching closely for further direction, as the Dollar's strength outweighs the positive economic news from the Eurozone. For now, 1.1860 serves as a critical support level, with the potential for further declines if it fails to hold.

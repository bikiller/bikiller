EUR/USD is currently trading at 1.1575, maintaining its gains as it hovers just below the critical 1.1600 level. Market participants are closely watching upcoming economic data, particularly the US Durable Goods Orders and Jobless Claims, which could influence the currency pair's movements. 

The exchange rate reflects a cautious optimism in the EUR, supported by better-than-expected Eurozone economic indicators. However, with the USD's strength potentially bolstered by fresh economic insights, traders remain on alert for any shifts that may impact the balance between the euro and the dollar in the coming sessions.

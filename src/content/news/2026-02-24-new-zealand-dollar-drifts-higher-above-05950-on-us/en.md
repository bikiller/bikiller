The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) extended its upward momentum during Asian trading hours on Tuesday, pushing the NZD/USD currency pair to around 0.5965. This move was fueled by a weakened US Dollar (USD), as market participants continued to digest ongoing uncertainty surrounding US trade policy. The USD remains under pressure, failing to capitalize on any significant support.

As the NZD continues to hover above the 0.5950 mark, the broader market sentiment suggests that the Greenback’s weakness may persist. Uncertainty over trade negotiations and policy direction in the US continues to undermine investor confidence, with the NZD benefitting from these conditions. Traders will be closely monitoring developments, as the exchange rate may see further fluctuations depending on any trade-related updates.

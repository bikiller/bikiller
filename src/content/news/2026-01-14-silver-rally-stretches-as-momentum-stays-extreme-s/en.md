Silver has surged significantly, moving towards the upper limit of a steep ascending channel, currently targeting the $96.50 to $97.00 range. Société Générale’s FX analysts highlight that momentum indicators have reached multi-year highs. However, they also caution about signs suggesting the trend may be overstretched, indicating potential volatility in the near future.

This rally could influence trading strategies for both silver and associated currency pairs, potentially affecting the USD and EUR exchange rates. As traders remain vigilant, the current momentum may provide opportunities for profit, but the risk of a market correction looms if the upward trend fails to sustain itself. Analysts will be closely monitoring these developments as they unfold.

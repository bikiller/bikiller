The Australian Dollar (AUD) maintained its position against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, buoyed by a cautious sentiment surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy stance. The currency pair showed resilience in the face of external pressures, particularly following the People's Bank of China's (PBoC) decision to leave its Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) steady for November.

As traders digest the implications of China's monetary policy, the AUD/USD exchange rate remains stable, reflecting a broader market confidence. This stability may indicate that investors are weighing the impact of the RBA's forthcoming decisions against the backdrop of global economic conditions, particularly in China, which has significant influence on Australia's trade dynamics.

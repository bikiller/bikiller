The USD/JPY currency pair saw modest gains, trading around 158.65 during the early Asian session on Friday. This upward movement is attributed to a decline in US Initial Jobless Claims, which bolstered the strength of the US Dollar. As traders reacted to the positive labor market data, the exchange rate reflected the increased demand for USD against the JPY.

Looking ahead, market participants will be attentive to the upcoming US December Industrial Production report, scheduled for release later today. Any positive surprises in the industrial sector could further enhance the USD's position, potentially pushing the USD/JPY pair to new technical levels. As the trading day unfolds, the dynamics between the two currencies will be closely monitored for further insights into market sentiment.

Gold (XAU/USD) is currently trading near a two-week high, struggling to maintain upward momentum while hovering below the key resistance level of $4,200. Despite a positive shift in the Asian session, the precious metal is facing mixed fundamental cues that have stifled further gains. Traders are closely monitoring the market's sentiment amidst fluctuating economic indicators.

The positive risk tone in global markets has provided some support for gold, yet the currency pair remains constrained by uncertainty in the broader economic landscape. As investors weigh the implications of upcoming data releases and central bank policies, the exchange rate dynamics between gold and the USD continue to influence trading strategies. Market participants are keenly observing how these factors will shape gold's trajectory in the short term.

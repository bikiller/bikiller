The British Pound (GBP) has started the week on the back foot, softening against the Japanese Yen (JPY) as it trades near 205.25, marking a five-day low. The decline in the GBP/JPY exchange rate comes in response to hawkish remarks from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda, which have bolstered the Yen across various currency pairs.

Ueda's comments signal a potential tightening of monetary policy, leading to increased demand for the JPY. As traders react to this shift, the implications for GBP/JPY and other currency pairs could be significant, particularly as market participants assess the overall strength of the Yen against major currencies like the USD and EUR in the coming sessions.

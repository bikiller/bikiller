The Pound Sterling (GBP) struggled against its major counterparts on Wednesday, despite the latest inflation report from the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) showing a higher-than-expected inflation rate in December. The annual inflation rate rose to 4.0%, surpassing economists' forecasts of 3.8%. This unexpected spike in inflation raised questions about the Bank of England's future monetary policy decisions.

In currency trading, GBP/USD was trading lower around 1.2200, while GBP/EUR also saw declines, hovering near 1.1450. Market sentiment suggested that while inflation might prompt a reevaluation of interest rates, the overall economic outlook for the UK remains uncertain. As traders assess these developments, the Pound's performance against the USD and EUR reflects a cautious approach to the evolving economic landscape.

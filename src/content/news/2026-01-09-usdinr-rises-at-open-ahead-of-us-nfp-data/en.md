The Indian Rupee (INR) opened lower against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR currency pair rising to approximately 90.25. This movement reflects the strengthening of the USD as traders anticipate the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data for December, scheduled for 13:30 GMT.

As the market adjusts ahead of this crucial economic indicator, the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and INR suggest a cautious sentiment among investors. The upcoming NFP data is expected to provide insights into the health of the US labor market, potentially influencing future trading strategies and currency valuations.

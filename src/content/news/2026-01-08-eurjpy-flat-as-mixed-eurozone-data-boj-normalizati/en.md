EUR/JPY is trading around 183.00 on Thursday, showing little movement for the day as mixed economic data from the Eurozone balances against supportive sentiment for the Japanese Yen (JPY). The exchange rate's stability comes amid rising expectations for monetary policy normalization from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which is helping to anchor JPY.

The recent Eurozone macroeconomic releases have created uncertainty, limiting the EUR's strength against the JPY. As traders digest these mixed results, the currency pair remains flat, with the current dynamics reflecting the ongoing tug-of-war between Japan's monetary policy outlook and fluctuating economic indicators from Europe.

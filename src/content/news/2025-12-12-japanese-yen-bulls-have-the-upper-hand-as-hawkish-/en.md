The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing a cautious trading session against major currencies, particularly as traders anticipate a hawkish shift from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). With speculation rising that the BoJ may implement an interest rate hike as early as next week, the JPY faces limited bearish momentum, even as broader market sentiment remains risk-on. This dynamic is influencing currency pairs, notably USD/JPY, which is reflecting volatility in exchange rates.

As the market digests these potential policy changes, the JPY's resilience could impact trading strategies across various currency pairs. With the USD holding firm and the EUR also gaining ground, traders are closely monitoring the developments from the BoJ. Should the BoJ follow through with a rate increase, we could see a significant shift in the JPY’s performance, further influencing trading patterns and market sentiment in the coming sessions.

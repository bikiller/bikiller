The Australian Dollar (AUD) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, maintaining a position below its recent multi-month high. The AUD/USD exchange rate has consolidated after a slight pullback from its highest level since September 18, reflecting cautious market sentiment ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) upcoming decision.

Traders are closely monitoring the RBA's policy directions, which could significantly impact the currency pair's movement. As the market awaits the central bank's announcement, the AUD's current stability suggests a wait-and-see approach among investors. The implications of the RBA's decision could lead to increased volatility in the AUD/USD exchange rate, influencing broader market dynamics.

The AUD/USD currency pair is experiencing a downtrend during the Asian session on Thursday, retreating from strong gains made earlier in the week. After reaching its highest level since September 17, the exchange rate is now hovering above the mid-0.6600s, reflecting the mixed employment data released from Australia. 

Traders are closely monitoring these developments as the AUD/USD pair struggles to maintain momentum. The mixed jobs figures have led to uncertainty in the market, impacting investor confidence in the Australian dollar against the US dollar. As the pair drifts lower, market participants are recalibrating their positions ahead of potential moves influenced by upcoming economic indicators from both economies.

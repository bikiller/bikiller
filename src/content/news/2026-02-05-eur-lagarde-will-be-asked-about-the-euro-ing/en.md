The euro has shown resilience despite recent market turbulence, with EUR/USD trading largely steady. ING's Chris Turner points to the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) press conference as a key event that could influence the currency pair. President Christine Lagarde's comments regarding the euro's strength and the risks to inflation will be crucial for determining the direction of EUR/USD.

With the exchange rate hovering around key levels, traders are closely watching any hints of dovish rhetoric from Lagarde. If she acknowledges downside risks to inflation, it could signal a potential shift in the ECB's monetary policy stance, weighing on the euro. A dovish tone could lead to a weaker euro against the USD, while a more hawkish outlook might offer further support to EUR/USD.

The GBP/USD currency pair is experiencing bullish momentum, continuing its upward trend for a second consecutive day. Following a robust rally, the exchange rate is now eyeing a significant psychological level at 1.3500. Traders are closely monitoring this threshold, as a sustained move above could signal increased buying interest and a potential shift in market sentiment.

The recent strength of the pound against the USD has been supported by positive economic indicators and a risk-on environment in global markets. As investor confidence grows, the implications for the GBP/USD pair could lead to further gains, particularly if the bulls manage to establish a firm foothold above the 1.3500 mark. Market participants will be keen to see how upcoming data releases influence trading dynamics in this volatile forex landscape.

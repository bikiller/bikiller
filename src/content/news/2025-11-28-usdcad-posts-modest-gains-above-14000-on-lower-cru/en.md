The USD/CAD currency pair saw modest gains, trading around 1.4030 during the Asian session on Friday. This upward movement comes amidst a backdrop of declining crude oil prices, which typically influence the Canadian dollar's performance. As crude prices soften, the loonie faces pressure, allowing the Greenback to find support above the key technical level of 1.4000.

However, the potential for further upside in the USD may be capped as market participants anticipate additional monetary easing measures from the US Federal Reserve at their upcoming meeting. This environment of uncertainty surrounding interest rates could lead to cautious trading, limiting significant gains for the USD/CAD exchange rate in the near term. Traders will closely monitor economic indicators ahead of the Fed's decision to gauge the future trajectory of this currency pair.

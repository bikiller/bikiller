The Japanese Yen (JPY) showed signs of recovery during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, moving away from a nine-month low against the US Dollar (USD). The exchange rate had reached a low of 146.72 JPY to 1 USD the day before, prompting some buying interest in the currency pair as traders looked to capitalize on the dip.

Despite this rebound, analysts suggest that the upside potential for the Yen may remain limited. Factors such as ongoing monetary policy divergence between the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve continue to weigh on the currency, with investors cautious about the Yen's ability to sustain gains against the strength of the USD and other major currencies like the Euro (EUR).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) is set to release crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November on Wednesday at 07:00 GMT. Traders are keenly awaiting this release, as the CPI figures will likely influence market sentiment around the GBP/USD currency pair. A higher-than-expected inflation reading could bolster the British pound, while a lower figure may exert downward pressure on the exchange rate.

Market analysts are closely monitoring the CPI results for signs of persistent inflation, which could prompt the Bank of England to adopt a more hawkish stance on monetary policy. Currently, GBP/USD is navigating technical levels, with potential resistance around 1.2300 and support near 1.2100. The reaction in the forex market following the CPI announcement could set the tone for trading in the days ahead, impacting both the pound and its performance against the USD and EUR.

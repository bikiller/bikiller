The USD/CAD currency pair has seen a rebound, trading around the key psychological level of 1.4000 during the Asian session on Wednesday. This comes after the pair experienced a 0.5% decline in the previous session, as the Canadian Dollar (CAD), closely tied to commodity prices, faces downward pressure due to falling crude oil prices.

The decline in oil prices has contributed to a shift in market sentiment, leading to eased bets on potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

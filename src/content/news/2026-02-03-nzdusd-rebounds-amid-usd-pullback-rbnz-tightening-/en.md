NZD/USD bounced back to 0.6050 on Tuesday, climbing 0.75% after two days of losses. The rebound was driven by a pullback in the US Dollar, which saw a reduction in its recent gains across major currencies. As the USD weakened, the New Zealand Dollar found support, recovering from its earlier downtrend.

The shift in momentum follows the recent strength of the USD, driven by broader market sentiment. The pullback allows NZD to regain ground, but the pair remains sensitive to broader developments. Expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) could provide further support to NZD/USD, as traders anticipate potential rate hikes amid global inflationary pressures.

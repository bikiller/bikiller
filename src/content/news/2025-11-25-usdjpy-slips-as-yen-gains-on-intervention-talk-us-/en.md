The Japanese Yen (JPY) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, pushing the USD/JPY exchange rate lower amid speculation of potential intervention by Japanese authorities. Market sentiment shifted as traders reacted to the possibility of measures to support the Yen, reflecting a growing concern about currency stability.

In addition, disappointing US economic data contributed to the USD's weakness, further compounding downward pressure on the currency pair.

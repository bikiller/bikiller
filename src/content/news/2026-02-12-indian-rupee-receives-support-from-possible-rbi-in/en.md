The USD/INR exchange rate declined on Thursday, reversing some of its gains from the prior session. The Indian Rupee (INR) received support, aided by the possibility of intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Despite stronger-than-expected US jobs data, which pushed US Treasury yields higher, Asian currencies remained largely stable, helping to limit the downward movement in the INR.

The pullback in USD/INR highlights the resilience of the Rupee, which has managed to stay firm against the backdrop of rising global yields. With the pair weakening, traders are keeping a close eye on further developments, including any potential actions by the RBI to stabilize the INR. This comes amid a broader market focus on the impact of US economic data and its effects on currency dynamics.

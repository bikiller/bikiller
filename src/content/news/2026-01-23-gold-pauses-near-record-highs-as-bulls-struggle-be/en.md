Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a slight pullback on Friday as profit-taking emerged after a strong surge that brought prices to a fresh record high near $4,967 earlier in the Asian session. The precious metal has since hovered around $4,930, with market participants reassessing positions. Despite the minor dip, gold remains on track for its third consecutive weekly gain, highlighting the ongoing bullish trend.

The move above the $4,900 level has intensified the focus on gold’s potential to reach new highs, yet resistance near $5,000 continues to challenge bulls. The current exchange rate of XAU/USD reflects investor caution, with markets waiting for further catalysts to push the currency pair beyond its current range. The trend could signal continued strength for gold, driven by persistent uncertainty in global markets and the weaker outlook for the USD.

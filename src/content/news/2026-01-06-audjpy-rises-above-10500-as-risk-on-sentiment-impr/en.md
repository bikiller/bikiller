AUD/JPY has shown a robust upward trend, climbing for the third consecutive session and trading around 105.20 during the European hours on Tuesday. Earlier in the trading session, the currency pair reached a high of 105.37, marking its strongest level since July 2024. This momentum reflects improved risk-on sentiment in the market, likely spurred by positive economic indicators and investor optimism.

The rise in the AUD/JPY exchange rate suggests a shift in market dynamics, favoring higher-yielding currencies amid a backdrop of geopolitical stability and easing concerns over global economic conditions. As traders remain focused on the implications of U.S. monetary policy and overall market sentiment, the continued strength of the Australian dollar against the yen could signal further bullish momentum in this currency pair, potentially influencing trading strategies in other forex markets.

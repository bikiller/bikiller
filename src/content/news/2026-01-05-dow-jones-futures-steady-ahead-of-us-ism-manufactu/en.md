Dow Jones futures saw a modest increase of 0.06%, trading around 48,650 during the European session on Monday. The positive sentiment extended to S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures, which rose by 0.14% and 0.38%, respectively, reaching approximately 6,910 and 25,480. This upward movement reflects cautious optimism among traders as they await key economic data.

Market participants are particularly focused on the upcoming US ISM Manufacturing PMI, which could influence the USD's exchange rate against major currency pairs. A stronger-than-expected reading may bolster the USD, while disappointing figures could lead to volatility in trading. As investors position themselves ahead of this announcement, the overall market trend appears to be leaning towards stability, with potential implications for the broader forex landscape.

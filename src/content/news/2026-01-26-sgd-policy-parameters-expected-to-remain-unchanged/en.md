The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is expected to keep the SGD NEER policy band parameters unchanged in its upcoming review. Analysts predict minimal downside risks for the USD/SGD currency pair, with the exchange rate likely to remain above the 1.2675 level. The market anticipates stable conditions for the Singapore dollar, given the current policy stance.

Philip Wee, Senior FX Strategist at DBS Bank, suggests that the MAS is likely to maintain its current strategy, which has led to limited movement in the SGD's value. With the USD/SGD trading firm, traders are not expecting significant shifts in the exchange rate in the near term. This stability reflects broader market expectations for Singapore's monetary policy.

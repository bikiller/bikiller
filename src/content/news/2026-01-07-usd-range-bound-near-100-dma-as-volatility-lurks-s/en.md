The US Dollar (USD) remains largely stable, maintaining a narrow trading range around the 100-day moving average at 98.58. After a slight rebound in the Dollar Index (DXY) yesterday, the currency has shown minimal fluctuations, indicating a cautious market sentiment among traders. 

As the USD holds steady, investors are closely monitoring volatility across major currency pairs, particularly against the Euro (EUR) and other key currencies. This stability may reflect a wait-and-see approach as market participants anticipate upcoming economic data that could influence exchange rates and broader trading strategies.

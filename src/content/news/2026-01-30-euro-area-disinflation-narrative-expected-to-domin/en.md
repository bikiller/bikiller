Societe Generale expects the euro area’s disinflation story to dominate market narratives into 2026, underpinned by easing wage pressures and supportive commodity dynamics. The bank forecasts headline inflation to average 1.7% in 2026, down from 2.1% in 2025, reinforcing expectations that price pressures will remain contained. This outlook frames a calmer macro backdrop for EUR-denominated assets.

For forex trading, the inflation path has clear implications for the exchange rate outlook, particularly for the EUR/USD currency pair. Softer inflation reduces the urgency for restrictive ECB policy, potentially narrowing rate differentials with the USD. As a result, euro rallies may remain measured, with traders focusing on relative growth and policy signals rather than aggressive tightening expectations.

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor wage settlements, energy prices, and broader commodity trends for confirmation of the disinflation trajectory. If the forecast holds, it could encourage more stable trading conditions for the EUR against the USD and other majors. However, any upside inflation surprise could quickly shift sentiment and reprice currency pairs across the board.

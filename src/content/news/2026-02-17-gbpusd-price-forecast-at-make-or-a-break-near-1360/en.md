The GBP/USD currency pair has seen a partial recovery from earlier losses in the European session on Tuesday, managing to claw back about half of its previous downturn. Despite this rebound, the exchange rate remains under pressure, trading at approximately 1.3600, marking a 0.23% decline for the day.

The price action near the 1.3600 level suggests a critical juncture for the pair. Traders are closely monitoring this key support zone, as a break below could trigger further downside potential. The market’s movement appears influenced by ongoing USD strength, with broader risk sentiment and economic data adding to the volatility in the forex market.

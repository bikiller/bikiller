EUR/USD is holding firm near the 1.1750 level as it extends its gains for the third consecutive session, trading around 1.1730 during the Asian hours on Wednesday. The currency pair is benefiting from a weakening US Dollar (USD), which is under pressure due to rising geopolitical concerns involving the United States and Greenland. 

The surge in Germany's ZEW index has also contributed to the Euro's strength, signaling positive economic sentiment in the Eurozone. As the exchange rate moves upward, traders are closely monitoring the implications of these developments on future monetary policy and potential impacts on the broader forex market.

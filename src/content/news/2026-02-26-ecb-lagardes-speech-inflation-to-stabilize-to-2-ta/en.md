European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde addressed the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, emphasizing that Eurozone inflation is expected to stabilize around the ECB's 2% target in the medium term. This forecast comes as the ECB continues to monitor economic conditions following a series of rate hikes aimed at curbing inflation. The statement had a significant impact on the EUR/USD exchange rate, which saw modest fluctuations during European trading hours.

Market reactions to Lagarde’s comments were mixed, with the EUR/USD holding steady just below the 1.0700 mark. Investors are now weighing the implications for future ECB policy, particularly with concerns about the pace of global economic recovery. The central bank’s focus on maintaining inflation control could continue to support the euro against a weaker dollar, although volatility remains high as traders anticipate further guidance on interest rate trajectories.

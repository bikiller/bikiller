The USD/JPY eased on Friday as the US Dollar lost earlier gains following softer-than-expected US inflation data. The exchange rate of the currency pair dropped as traders digested the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed a slower pace of inflation. The Greenback, which had initially rallied, gave up some of its strength, causing the USD/JPY to trade lower at 131.20, down from its earlier highs.

Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen remained resilient, supported by ongoing demand for safe-haven assets amid market uncertainty. The CPI data failed to significantly alter expectations for the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy trajectory, but the Yen’s firmness indicated sustained investor interest in the currency. As USD/JPY continues to fluctuate near key levels, traders will be closely watching any further economic data for cues on potential price direction.

The EUR/USD currency pair has seen a decline, dipping below the 1.1800 level after briefly reaching a high of 1.2081 last week. Traders are closely watching the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) policy meeting, as its outcomes could significantly influence the Euro's performance. The shift in EUR/USD is indicative of market uncertainty ahead of key decisions from the ECB.

The movement below the 1.1800 mark signals potential weakness for the Euro against the US Dollar. With the ECB's policy stance in focus, any hints of dovish rhetoric could put further pressure on EUR/USD. Conversely, a more hawkish tone from the central bank could offer support, potentially leading to a rebound above 1.1800. The upcoming meeting will be pivotal in determining the Euro's near-term direction.

The euro remains under pressure as market participants await key comments from European Central Bank (ECB) officials. ECB members Isabel Schnabel and Fabio Cipollone are set to deliver speeches this week, which could provide insight into future monetary policy direction amid growing speculation about potential rate cuts. EUR/USD is currently trading around 1.0780, with the currency pair showing signs of volatility as investors position themselves ahead of these remarks. 

Commerzbank’s Erik Liem points out that the strong euro is also a critical factor in the ongoing rate debate, influencing inflation dynamics and ECB decision-making. The exchange rate has held firm despite weaker economic data, which could sway the central bank’s approach. If the speeches signal a shift towards more dovish policy, EUR/USD could face downward pressure, potentially testing the 1.0700 support level. Market sentiment remains finely balanced, with the euro’s resilience amid global uncertainties making it a focal point for traders.

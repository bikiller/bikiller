Silver prices (XAG/USD) have dropped 2% during the Asian trading session on Monday, with the currency pair trading at approximately $75.00. This decline follows a weaker market sentiment as traders remain cautious about global economic conditions and the ongoing strength of the US dollar. Investors are closely monitoring key data points for signs of direction, particularly in relation to USD performance.

The drop in silver prices reflects broader risk-off sentiment in the markets, where investors are shifting toward safer assets amid uncertainty. As the USD strengthens against other major currencies, such as the EUR, the exchange rate dynamics put downward pressure on precious metals. Traders are eyeing potential support levels for XAG/USD near $75.00, with any further weakness likely to test deeper support zones in the coming sessions.

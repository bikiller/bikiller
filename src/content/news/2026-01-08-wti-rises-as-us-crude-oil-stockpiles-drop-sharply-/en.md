West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil surged to approximately $56.70 on Thursday, gaining 0.90% as traders reacted to data revealing a significant drop in US crude oil stockpiles. This unexpected decline has bolstered bullish sentiment in the market, prompting an uptick in trading activity as investors position themselves for potential further gains.

The reduction in stockpiles not only supports WTI prices but also draws attention to ongoing developments in Venezuelan oil exports, which could influence global supply dynamics. As oil prices rise, the implications for currency pairs involving the USD are noteworthy, particularly as WTI strengthens against other commodities and currencies like the EUR, potentially affecting broader market exchange rates.

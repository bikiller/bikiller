The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its downward trend against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, marking its sixth consecutive day of losses. The exchange rate slipped to 0.6460, reflecting a broader sentiment of caution among investors despite a rise in consumer inflation expectations. This decline has raised concerns about the AUD's resilience in the face of ongoing economic pressures.

Market analysts attribute the AUD's weakness to a stronger USD, buoyed by robust economic indicators and rising interest rate expectations from the Federal Reserve. The EUR/AUD pair is also facing downward pressure, trading at 1.6540, suggesting a growing preference for the USD amid global uncertainty. As traders monitor these developments, further fluctuations in the AUD are anticipated, influenced by upcoming economic data releases and shifts in market sentiment.

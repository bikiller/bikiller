Oil prices, particularly ICE Brent, surged last week as geopolitical risks escalated over potential U.S. action against Iran, pushing markets into volatility. The rise came amid heightened tensions, with traders speculating on potential disruptions to oil supply. However, the rally has since softened as further U.S.-Iran talks are scheduled, easing some concerns. The uncertainty surrounding these negotiations continues to influence market sentiment.

The softer price movement in oil also reflects broader market dynamics, with the USD showing strength against major currencies like the EUR and GBP. Oil prices, a key driver of inflation and economic policy, remain sensitive to global developments. Traders are watching key technical levels and political updates closely, with any significant breakthrough or setback in U.S.-Iran discussions likely to cause more substantial price shifts. As the situation unfolds, oil’s price trajectory could have broader implications for currency pairs and global trade flows.

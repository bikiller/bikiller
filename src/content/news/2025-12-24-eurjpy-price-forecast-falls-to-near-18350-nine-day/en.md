EUR/JPY continues its downward trajectory for the third consecutive session, currently trading around 183.70 during European trading hours. The currency pair has fallen to near the critical support level of 183.50, closely aligning with the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA). This decline indicates ongoing selling pressure in the market, which could challenge the bullish sentiment that has characterized recent price action.

Despite the current losses, EUR/JPY remains within an ascending channel pattern, suggesting that a bullish bias could still be intact in the longer term. Traders will be closely monitoring this technical setup for potential reversal signals, as any significant movement below the 183.50 level may lead to further bearish momentum. Market participants are advised to watch for developments in the eurozone and Japan that could influence the exchange rate and overall market sentiment.

Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a rise on Friday, trading around $4,209, as it heads for its fourth consecutive monthly gain. After a recent volatility episode caused by a CME trading outage, which momentarily pushed prices lower, the precious metal has regained momentum, fueled by increasing expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. 

The market's focus on potential easing from the Fed has bolstered investor interest in gold as a safe-haven asset. As the exchange rate for XAU/USD strengthens, traders are closely monitoring any developments in U.S. monetary policy that could influence the dollar's performance against other currencies like the EUR. The implications of these shifts underscore the ongoing tug-of-war in forex markets, highlighting gold's resilience amid fluctuating economic sentiment.

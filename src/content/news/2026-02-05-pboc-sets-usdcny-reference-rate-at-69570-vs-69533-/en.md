The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the USD/CNY reference rate at 6.9570 for Thursday’s trading session, slightly higher than the previous day's fixing of 6.9533. This adjustment comes amid ongoing market volatility and signals the central bank's cautious stance on the yuan's movements. The fixing is also above the 6.9468 estimate from Reuters, hinting at a marginal weakening of the yuan.

This subtle shift in the exchange rate reflects broader economic conditions, with investors closely monitoring China's trade data and economic indicators. The PBOC's adjustments to the yuan's central rate play a crucial role in managing fluctuations in the currency pair, affecting both domestic and global market sentiment. As traders adjust to these movements, the USD/CNY remains sensitive to geopolitical developments and policy shifts.

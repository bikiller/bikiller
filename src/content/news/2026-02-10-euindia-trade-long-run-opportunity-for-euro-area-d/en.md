Danske Bank analysts are highlighting the recently finalized EU–India trade agreement, which is set to eliminate tariffs on over 90% of traded goods within seven years. While India currently accounts for just 1.5% of Euro area exports, the country is expected to experience an annual growth rate of 6.5% through 2030. This long-term expansion presents significant potential for the Eurozone’s economic landscape, particularly in terms of strengthening trade relations.

In forex markets, the Euro (EUR) stands to benefit from the agreement, potentially boosting the EUR/INR currency pair. As India becomes a more vital trading partner, demand for the Euro may rise, influencing exchange rates. Traders should closely monitor the EUR/USD pair, as the deal could also prompt shifts in the broader market sentiment toward the Euro, with increased export opportunities translating to a stronger EUR across various pairs.

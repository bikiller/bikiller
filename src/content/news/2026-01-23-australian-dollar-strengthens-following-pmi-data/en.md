The Australian Dollar (AUD) gained momentum against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, edging higher for the second consecutive day. Trading at 0.6745, the currency pair strengthened following positive data from the Australian Manufacturing PMI. The Australian economy showed resilience, boosting market sentiment and supporting the AUD's gains. 

This upward movement came despite the ongoing strength of the USD, which has maintained a dominant position against major currencies. The AUD/USD exchange rate’s steady rise signals growing investor confidence in Australia's economic outlook. As the trading week progresses, the pair remains poised for further gains if additional positive economic indicators support the bullish sentiment in the currency.

The GBP/USD currency pair is retreating after reaching its highest point in over four years, trading just above 1.3780 on Wednesday. This marks a pullback from the recent peak of 1.3868, which saw the Pound advance against the US Dollar amid a stronger market sentiment. The currency pair's movement reflects the broader market anticipation of the upcoming Federal Reserve decisions.

Traders are now bracing for potential impacts from the Federal Reserve's actions, with expectations of future interest rate hikes potentially influencing the USD's strength. As the Fed's policy stance remains a focal point for investors, fluctuations in the GBP/USD exchange rate are likely to persist, with further volatility anticipated in the lead-up to key announcements. The pair's current levels remain near significant technical support, adding an extra layer of focus to the ongoing market dynamics.

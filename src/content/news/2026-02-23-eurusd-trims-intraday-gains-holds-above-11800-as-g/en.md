EUR/USD trimmed its intraday gains on Monday but managed to hold above the 1.1800 level during the first half of the European session. Despite positive trading momentum earlier, the currency pair remained largely flat after the release of Germany’s IFO business survey for February. The survey, which showed mixed results, failed to provide enough direction for traders to push the exchange rate higher.

The EUR/USD pair showed resilience, maintaining its position above 1.1800, though volatility was contained. The IFO data, reflecting business sentiment in Germany, had little impact on the market as traders awaited further economic indicators. With the USD holding steady, the currency pair's movement remains constrained as the European session progresses. The outlook for EUR/USD will depend on upcoming events and any shifts in market sentiment surrounding the USD.

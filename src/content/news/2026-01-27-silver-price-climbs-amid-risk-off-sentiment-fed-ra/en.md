Silver (XAG/USD) surged 3.80% on Tuesday, trading at 112.50, continuing its four-day bullish streak after recovering from recent losses. The precious metal’s rise comes amid growing risk-off sentiment in global markets, where investors are seeking safe-haven assets. This shift has been further fueled by expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon cut interest rates, providing additional support to silver prices.

The XAG/USD exchange rate is benefiting from the softening outlook for the US dollar (USD) as traders anticipate a shift in US monetary policy. Silver’s price movement is also linked to broader market uncertainty, as concerns over global economic growth push investors toward assets perceived as more stable. As silver continues its upward trajectory, market participants will closely monitor any signs of change in the Fed's policy stance, which could drive further fluctuations in the price of the metal.

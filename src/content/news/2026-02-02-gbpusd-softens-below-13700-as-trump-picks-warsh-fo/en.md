The GBP/USD pair is facing downward pressure, dropping to 1.3670 during the early European session on Monday. The US Dollar strengthened amid growing demand, as market participants shifted focus towards signs of political stability in the United States. The Greenback’s rise, bolstered by news of President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh for the Federal Reserve, weighed on the British Pound.

This shift in sentiment led to a softening of the exchange rate below the key 1.3700 level. The Pound's vulnerability was exacerbated by ongoing concerns over the UK's economic outlook, while the US Dollar gained traction due to expectations of a more hawkish Fed stance. As the trading week progresses, further volatility in GBP/USD could occur depending on developments in US politics and economic data releases.

The EUR/USD currency pair is currently trading in positive territory, with the exchange rate hovering around 1.1755 during early European trading hours on Friday. This upward momentum reflects a bullish sentiment in the market, as traders remain optimistic about the euro's performance against the US dollar.

As the pair continues to gain traction, a key upside barrier has emerged above the 1.1800 level. Breaking through this threshold could pave the way for further gains, signaling sustained strength in the euro.

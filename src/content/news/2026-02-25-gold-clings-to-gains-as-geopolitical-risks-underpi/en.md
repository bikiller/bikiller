Gold (XAU/USD) continues to hold steady, maintaining modest intraday gains as it trades just below the $5,200 mark during the Asian session on Wednesday. The precious metal is also hovering near its monthly peak, which it reached on Tuesday. Geopolitical tensions have kept demand for safe-haven assets like gold elevated, offering support to its price.

Meanwhile, a weaker USD is adding to gold's upward momentum, as the greenback remains under pressure against major currencies like the EUR. With market participants cautious amid ongoing geopolitical risks, gold has attracted continued buying interest, strengthening its position within the market. As traders navigate these uncertainties, gold's ability to stay above key technical levels suggests further potential for price consolidation or slight upward movement in the near term.

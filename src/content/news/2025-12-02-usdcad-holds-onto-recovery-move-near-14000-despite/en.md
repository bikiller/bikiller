The USD/CAD currency pair continues to maintain its recovery, hovering around the 1.4010 level during the Asian trading session on Tuesday. This move comes amidst strong dovish expectations from the Federal Reserve, which have thus far not undermined the pair's upward momentum observed since Monday.

Traders remain attentive to the implications of the Fed's stance, as it could influence the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and CAD. The continued resilience of USD/CAD near the 1.4000 mark suggests that market participants are weighing broader economic signals while navigating through volatility in the forex market.

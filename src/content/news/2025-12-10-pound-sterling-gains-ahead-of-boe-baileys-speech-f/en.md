The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthened against major currencies on Wednesday as traders anticipate insights from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey's upcoming speech. The GBP/USD exchange rate rose sharply, reflecting a broader sentiment in favor of a cautious approach to monetary policy. BoE members appear to support a gradual shift away from restrictive measures rather than a rapid easing, which has bolstered confidence in the currency.

As the market looks ahead to the Federal Reserve's decision, the GBP/EUR pair also gained momentum, highlighting the divergence between UK and Eurozone monetary policies. With the BoE's emphasis on a steady approach, analysts suggest that the Pound could continue to rise if Bailey reinforces this stance, especially against a backdrop of potential volatility in USD movements following the Fed's announcement.

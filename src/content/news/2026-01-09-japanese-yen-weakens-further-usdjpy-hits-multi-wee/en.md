The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued its downward trend, with the USD/JPY currency pair reaching a multi-week high as the US dollar strengthens ahead of the upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. The exchange rate climbed amid growing uncertainty surrounding the timing of the next interest rate cut by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), influencing traders' sentiment.

Adding to the Yen's woes, rising tensions in the China-Japan relationship have further pressured the currency.

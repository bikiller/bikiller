Gold (XAU/USD) continues to face selling pressure for the second consecutive day, retreating closer to the overnight swing low during Thursday's Asian session. Traders are taking profits ahead of the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which is creating a cautious atmosphere in the market. The current exchange rate reflects this nervous sentiment, and while the downtick lacks significant fundamental drivers, it indicates traders are bracing for potential volatility.

As the market anticipates the NFP data, the overall backdrop remains supportive for gold, suggesting that the declines may be limited. The interplay of profit-taking and potential shifts in the USD's strength could influence gold's trajectory in the near term. Investors will be closely monitoring how the upcoming employment figures impact currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD and USD/JPY, as they seek to navigate this evolving trading environment.

EUR/USD has pulled back slightly, trading near 1.1730 on Friday, after seeing moderate losses. Despite this dip, the currency pair is holding onto most of the previous day's gains, reflecting its strong momentum heading into the final trading session of the week. The exchange rate remains on track for its best weekly performance since June, driven by a steady rise earlier in the week.

The market's focus is shifting to upcoming flash PMIs, which could provide further direction for EUR/USD. The modest retreat in the pair comes as traders position themselves ahead of potential volatility, though the euro has remained resilient against the USD. With the eurozone economic data in focus, the EUR/USD pair could see further fluctuations, depending on the outcomes of these reports.

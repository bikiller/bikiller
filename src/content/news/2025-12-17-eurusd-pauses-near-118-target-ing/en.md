EUR/USD has encountered a pause near the significant psychological level of 1.1800, as heavy option expiries contribute to a range-bound trading environment. Analysts at ING, led by FX expert Chris Turner, suggest that this stagnation reflects broader market uncertainty ahead of the European Central Bank's upcoming meeting. 

Traders are keenly awaiting any potential shifts in monetary policy that could provide direction for the currency pair. The exchange rate currently hovers around 1.1800, and the market's focus remains fixed on the ECB's decisions, which could catalyze movement in the USD and EUR dynamics in the near term.

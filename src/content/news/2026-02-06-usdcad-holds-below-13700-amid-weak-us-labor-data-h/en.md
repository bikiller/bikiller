The USD/CAD currency pair is experiencing mild losses, trading around 1.3685 in the early European session on Friday. The US Dollar has softened against the Canadian Dollar as weaker-than-expected US labor data impacts market sentiment. The economic figures have raised concerns about the strength of the US economy, contributing to the dollar's decline.

Meanwhile, a rise in crude oil prices is providing support for the Canadian Dollar, as the nation is a major oil exporter. As the exchange rate hovers below the key resistance level of 1.3700, traders are closely monitoring both economic indicators and commodity prices for further direction in this trading pair. The combination of softer dollar statistics and stronger oil prices could influence future movements in the USD/CAD exchange rate.

The European Parliament has paused ratification of the EU-US trade deal, seeking greater clarity on newly proposed US tariffs, according to Standard Chartered economist Christopher Graham. The move injects fresh uncertainty into transatlantic trade relations, prompting cautious trading across major currency pairs. The EUR/USD exchange rate hovered in tight ranges as investors assessed the potential impact of shifting tariff policy on growth and capital flows.

Market participants are particularly sensitive to how additional US tariffs could affect European exports and, by extension, Eurozone economic momentum. Any escalation in trade tensions may bolster demand for the USD as a relative safe haven, while limiting upside in the EUR. The currency pair’s near-term direction is likely to remain headline-driven, with traders closely monitoring policy signals from both Washington and Brussels.

For now, the lack of tariff clarity is restraining stronger directional moves in the exchange rate. If negotiations stall or tariffs expand, downside pressure on the EUR could intensify, especially against the USD. Conversely, a resolution that reduces trade friction may support renewed EUR buying, shifting trading sentiment and volatility across broader forex markets.

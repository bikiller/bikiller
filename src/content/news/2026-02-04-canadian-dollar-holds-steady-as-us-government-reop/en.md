The Canadian Dollar (CAD) remained steady against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, trading just below the 1.3700 mark. The currency pair showed little movement as markets adjusted to the news of the US government reopening after the partial shutdown. Traders processed the implications of the government’s return to normal operations, which had caused volatility in the currency markets earlier in the week.

The release of weaker-than-expected ADP private payroll data also kept the USD on the backfoot. The soft report dampened investor sentiment, suggesting potential economic slowdowns in the US. As a result, the CAD’s performance was muted, holding steady in the 1.3670-1.3700 range. The data reinforces the view of cautious optimism in the currency markets as participants await further economic indicators.

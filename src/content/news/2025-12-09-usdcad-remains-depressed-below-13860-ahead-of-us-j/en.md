The USD/CAD currency pair continues to trade under pressure, remaining below the 1.3860 level as the US Dollar hovers near two-month lows around 1.3800. This downward movement reflects a broader market sentiment, with the pair experiencing a nearly 2% decline since late November. Investor expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at this week's meeting are putting additional strain on the exchange rate.

As traders await crucial US jobs data, attempts for the USD to rally above 1.3860 have been limited, suggesting a cautious market. The focus on monetary policy shifts and economic indicators is likely to influence future trading strategies, with the potential for further volatility in the USD/CAD exchange rate as participants react to upcoming announcements.

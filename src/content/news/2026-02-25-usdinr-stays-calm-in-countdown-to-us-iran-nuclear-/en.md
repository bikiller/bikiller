The Indian Rupee (INR) held steady against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR exchange rate remaining largely unchanged as markets awaited key developments. As of the latest data, the pair was trading flat, maintaining its position amidst the build-up to the highly anticipated US-Iran nuclear talks and India's Q4 GDP data. Investors are closely watching these events, which could influence future market direction.

The lack of significant movement in the INR can be attributed to cautious trading ahead of these crucial events. While the USD continues to dominate in global markets, the INR’s stability reflects market participants’ wait-and-see approach. With technical levels holding steady, the focus remains on the upcoming geopolitical and economic developments, which could prompt volatility in the currency pair in the coming days.

Gold (XAU/USD) edged closer to its record high on Thursday, recovering from earlier losses as traders absorbed a slew of U.S. economic data. The currency pair rose nearly 0.80% to trade around $4,870, following a brief dip below the key $4,800 level. This move highlights the ongoing volatility as market participants assess economic signals and geopolitical tensions.

The price action of gold reflects the broader market dynamics, with traders weighing the impact of U.S. data releases. As global uncertainty persists, gold remains a safe-haven asset, with its price closely tied to fluctuations in the USD. The recovery in XAU/USD suggests that investors are cautious, navigating both economic indicators and geopolitical risks that continue to drive the forex market.

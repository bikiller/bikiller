The GBP/USD exchange rate fell sharply during the North American trading session, dropping nearly 100 pips to 1.3529. This 0.71% decline came as traders returned from the US President’s Day holiday, reacting to a disappointing UK jobs report. The unexpected rise in the UK jobless rate to its highest level in a decade placed additional pressure on the Pound.

The weaker-than-expected employment data fueled concerns over the UK economy, intensifying selling pressure on GBP. As a result, the currency pair struggled to maintain its position, with traders cautious about future economic growth. This drop highlights the ongoing challenges the Pound faces, particularly against a stronger USD, which has shown resilience in global markets.

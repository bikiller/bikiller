The Australian Dollar (AUD) is expected to trade within a range of 0.6685 to 0.6730 against the US Dollar (USD), according to analysis from UOB Group's FX experts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This range reflects a broader market trend where the AUD is navigating a range-trading phase, anticipated to fluctuate between 0.6655 and 0.6745 in the longer term.

As the currency pair stabilizes, traders should monitor external factors influencing the exchange rate, such as economic indicators and geopolitical events. The ongoing fluctuations within these technical levels suggest that the AUD's performance may remain subdued amid uncertainty surrounding global economic recovery and shifts in investor sentiment toward the USD and other major currencies.

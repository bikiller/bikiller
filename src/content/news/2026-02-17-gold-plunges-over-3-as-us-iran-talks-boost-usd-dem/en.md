Gold prices tumbled over 3% on Tuesday as the USD gained momentum following positive developments in U.S.-Iran negotiations. A senior White House official, quoted by Axios, indicated progress in talks, strengthening market confidence in the Greenback. As a result, the XAU/USD currency pair dropped sharply, with gold trading at $4,869, after hitting a daily high of $5,000 earlier in the session.

The US dollar’s rebound continued to exert pressure on gold, as investors flocked to the Greenback amid growing expectations of diplomatic advancements. This shift in sentiment significantly impacted the XAU/USD exchange rate, pushing the precious metal lower. With current trading levels near $4,869, the market remains sensitive to geopolitical developments and their potential influence on future USD strength.

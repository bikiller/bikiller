Gold (XAU/USD) has surged to a one-week high, reaching $4,428-4,427 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday. This rally has been driven by a flight to safety as investors seek refuge from market uncertainties, coupled with increasing speculation around potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. 

As the demand for safe-haven assets rises, the upward movement in gold's price reflects a broader trend in the forex market, impacting the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other currencies. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as shifts in monetary policy could influence not just gold, but also the performance of currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY in the coming sessions.

USD/CAD extended its gains for the second consecutive session, trading around 1.3680 during the Asian hours on Thursday. The currency pair has been supported by a stronger US Dollar (USD) as market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts slow down. The recent shift in sentiment has given the USD an upper hand, pushing the exchange rate closer to the key 1.3700 level.

The slowdown in anticipated Fed rate cuts has reinforced USD strength across the forex market. Traders are adjusting their outlook, signaling a potential delay in monetary easing. As a result, the USD/CAD pair has seen upward momentum, reflecting growing confidence in the US Dollar. Any further movement toward 1.3700 could set the stage for further technical adjustments in the coming sessions.

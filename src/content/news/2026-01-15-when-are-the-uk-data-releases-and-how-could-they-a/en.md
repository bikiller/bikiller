The UK will release its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Industrial Production data for November today at 07:00 GMT, as reported by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). These figures are expected to significantly influence the GBP/USD exchange rate, which is currently under pressure as traders weigh economic performance against a backdrop of rising inflation.

Market analysts anticipate that any positive surprises in the data could bolster the British pound, prompting a potential rally in the currency pair. Conversely, disappointing results may lead to a decline in GBP/USD, with key technical levels closely watched for signs of further movement. As traders position themselves ahead of the announcement, volatility in trading could increase, making it crucial to monitor these economic indicators closely.

GBP/JPY continues its bullish momentum, surpassing the 211.00 mark for the first time in over two weeks. This move follows a strong rally from the previous day, with the currency pair gaining traction for a second consecutive session. The exchange rate is buoyed by weakening expectations surrounding the Bank of Japan’s interest rate hike, which has pressured the Japanese yen.

The rise in GBP/JPY reflects broader market sentiment, as traders remain cautious about JPY strength amid a shift in rate hike speculation from the BoJ. With the pair breaking through key resistance levels, including 210.50, traders are eyeing further potential gains. This price action indicates that the pair could extend its upward trend, depending on the direction of global market risk sentiment and any shifts in USD or EUR currency dynamics.

USD/JPY is trading near 156.00, down 0.08% on the day, despite stronger-than-expected US Producer Price Index (PPI) data. The US Dollar struggled to capitalize on the inflation report, failing to extend its recent rebound against the Japanese Yen. The market’s response remains relatively muted, with the exchange rate hovering in a narrow range.

The Yen received further support as expectations of tightening from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) continue to build, countering the US Dollar's attempts to recover. With USD/JPY fluctuating near key technical levels, traders are closely monitoring both US inflation data and potential policy shifts from the BoJ, which could dictate the pair's next move in the near term.

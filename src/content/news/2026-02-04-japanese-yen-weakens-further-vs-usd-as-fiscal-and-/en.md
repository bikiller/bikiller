The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues its decline against the US Dollar (USD) for the fourth consecutive day, hitting a nearly two-week low during the Asian session on Wednesday. The USD/JPY currency pair traded at 135.45, reflecting a 0.4% drop as concerns over Japan’s fiscal and political instability overshadow the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) hawkish stance. 

Market sentiment has been weighed down by increasing uncertainty surrounding Japan's economic policies, while the BoJ’s tightening measures remain limited in their effect. This divergence in policy outlooks has led to further pressure on the Yen, as traders adjust expectations. The weakening Yen suggests ongoing vulnerability, with the USD/JPY pair possibly targeting higher levels in the near term, barring any major policy shifts from the BoJ.

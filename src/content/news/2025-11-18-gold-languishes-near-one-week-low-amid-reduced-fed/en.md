Gold (XAU/USD) continues to face downward pressure, trading near a one-week low as reduced expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts weigh on the market. Currently hovering around the $4,000 mark, the precious metal has experienced four consecutive days of losses, reflecting broader shifts in the forex landscape.

The decline in gold prices is largely attributed to a stronger USD, as traders recalibrate their outlook on monetary policy. As the Fed signals a more hawkish stance, the exchange rate dynamics are shifting, prompting investors to reassess their positions in safe-haven assets like gold. This trend may further influence trading strategies in the forex market, particularly between the USD and major currency pairs such as EUR/USD.

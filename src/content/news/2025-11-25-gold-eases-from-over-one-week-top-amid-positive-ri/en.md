Gold (XAU/USD) has pulled back slightly from a recent one-and-a-half-week high reached on Tuesday, reflecting a modest correction amid a generally positive risk sentiment in the market. The precious metal, which peaked near $1,950, is exhibiting resilience, suggesting that bullish potential remains intact despite this minor retreat.

Market participants are closely monitoring trading dynamics as the exchange rate for gold continues to be influenced by broader macroeconomic factors. With the USD showing strength against other currencies, including the EUR, the interplay between risk appetite and safe-haven demand will be crucial in determining gold's trajectory in the coming sessions. Although the recent upward momentum has slowed, the overall bullish outlook persists.

The EUR/USD currency pair ended Friday slightly lower, closing at 1.1600, reflecting a 0.10% loss for the day. However, the pair registered a weekly gain of 0.51%, buoyed by a decline in risk appetite amid increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve may pause its easing cycle in the upcoming month. This sentiment appears to have supported the euro against the USD, allowing the pair to maintain its position above the critical 1.1600 level.

As traders adjust their positions in response to evolving economic signals, the stability of the EUR/USD above 1.1600 sets the stage for potential further upside. Market participants are closely watching developments around Fed policy, which could influence the exchange rate in the coming sessions. The contrasting outlook for the Eurozone and the US economy continues to play a crucial role in shaping trading strategies for this currency pair.

Dow Jones futures dipped 0.06% to around 48,650 during Tuesday's European trading session, as investors braced for the upcoming release of the US Q3 GDP figures. The cautious sentiment extended to the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures, which fell 0.09% and 0.12%, trading at approximately 6,920 and 25,650, respectively. 

Market participants are closely monitoring these economic indicators, which could significantly impact the USD’s exchange rate against other currencies like the EUR. A stronger GDP could bolster the dollar, while a weaker report may lead to increased volatility in forex trading. As traders position themselves ahead of the release, fluctuations in major currency pairs are expected in the lead-up to the data.

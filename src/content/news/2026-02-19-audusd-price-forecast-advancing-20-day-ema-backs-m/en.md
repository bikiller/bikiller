The AUD/USD currency pair advanced 0.27% to near 0.7065 during the European trading session on Thursday, as the Australian Dollar (AUD) gained ground. The move comes on the heels of strong labor market data for January, which provided a boost to the AUD. Market participants reacted positively to the report, pushing the Aussie higher against the US Dollar (USD).

With the pair now trading above the key 20-day EMA, the outlook for further upside remains intact. The exchange rate could see additional gains if the positive momentum continues, with traders eyeing the 0.7100 level. The labor data has added to the bullish sentiment, strengthening the case for more AUD/USD upward movement in the near term.

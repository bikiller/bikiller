The Pound Sterling (GBP) opens the week cautiously as traders await the Bank of England's (BoE) upcoming monetary policy decision. Currently, the GBP/USD exchange rate hovers around 1.3700, reflecting a stable sentiment among investors. The market is closely monitoring key UK economic data that may influence the central bank's stance, further complicating trading dynamics against major currencies.

As the week progresses, the GBP is also trading in a tight range against the Euro, with the EUR/GBP exchange rate around 0.8500. Analysts suggest that any unexpected shifts in the BoE's policies or the UK economic outlook could lead to increased volatility. Traders are urged to watch for potential breakout levels that could dictate the short-term direction of these currency pairs.

The AUD/USD currency pair is trading lower on Thursday, hovering around 0.6965, down 0.45% on the day. The US Dollar has gained strength following hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, prompting a pullback in risk-sensitive assets like the Australian Dollar. Investors are reacting to expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Fed, which continues to support the USD's bullish momentum.

The exchange rate for AUD/USD is under pressure as market participants anticipate further interest rate hikes from the Fed in the coming months. This has led to a shift in sentiment, with the USD outperforming the Australian Dollar, which has been weighed down by weaker commodity prices. If the pair breaks below the 0.6950 support level, further downside could be expected, with traders closely watching the Fed's next moves for more direction.

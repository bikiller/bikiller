The EUR/USD currency pair remains stable around the opening price of 1.1750, showing little movement as the Dollar strengthens amidst a light economic calendar in the US. This recovery in the USD contrasts with recent data from the Eurozone, which revealed easing inflation and a decline in business confidence in Germany, adding pressure to the single currency.

As traders assess the implications of these developments, the exchange rate is likely to be influenced by further economic indicators. With the Dollar gaining traction, market participants will be watching closely for any signs of shifts in monetary policy or economic outlooks that could affect the trading dynamics between the EUR and USD in the coming sessions.

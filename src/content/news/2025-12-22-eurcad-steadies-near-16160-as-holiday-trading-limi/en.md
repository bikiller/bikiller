EUR/CAD remained stable around the 1.6160 mark during early European trading on Monday, showing minimal movement following slight gains in the previous session. The currency pair is experiencing subdued activity, as holiday trading conditions limit market volumes ahead of the Christmas period.

With light trading expected this week, participants in the forex market are likely to see reduced fluctuations in the EUR/CAD exchange rate. This environment may lead to less volatility, impacting traders' ability to capitalize on price movements within the currency pair as they navigate through the holiday-shortened week.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are experiencing a downward trend, retreating for the second consecutive day to trade around $59.20 per barrel, marking a 1.60% decline. This pullback is largely attributed to easing tensions surrounding Iran, as concerns over a potential U.S. military action diminish, impacting market sentiment.

Additionally, increased exports from Venezuela are putting further pressure on oil prices, contributing to the overall bearish outlook. As the market adjusts, traders are closely monitoring the USD exchange rate and its potential influence on commodity prices, as shifts in currency strength can significantly impact trading strategies in the oil sector.

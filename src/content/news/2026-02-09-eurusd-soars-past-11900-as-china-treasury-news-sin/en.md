EUR/USD surged by over 0.80% on Monday, crossing the 1.1900 mark as the US Dollar struggled to find direction. The rally came after news that Chinese authorities advised financial institutions to reduce their holdings of US Treasuries. This recommendation followed significant volatility in the fixed income markets, putting pressure on the Dollar. As a result, the EUR/USD exchange rate gained ground, benefiting from the uncertainty surrounding US bond market stability.

The sharp movement in EUR/USD reflects growing concerns over US Treasury stability, which has placed the Greenback on the back foot. The currency pair's climb past 1.1900 suggests that traders are reacting to these global financial shifts. With the Dollar weakened by the latest developments in China, traders are now looking for further signs of volatility or new measures to address US Treasury market concerns.

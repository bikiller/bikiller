The US Dollar (USD) rebounded on Monday, gaining momentum after hitting multi-day lows. Traders are closely watching upcoming US economic data releases, including the ADP Weekly Employment Report, which could influence expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts. The current exchange rate for the USD against the Euro (EUR) reflects this renewed strength, as the pair shifted above key technical levels.

Market sentiment remains cautious as participants await the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) Minutes and comments from Federal Reserve officials. The interplay between these events and the evolving economic landscape will likely impact trading strategies and currency pair movements. As the week unfolds, the focus will remain on how these factors shape the outlook for the USD and its peers in the forex market.

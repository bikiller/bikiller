USD/KRW has continued its range-bound movement, showing a slight downside bias, with the exchange rate under pressure despite some support from solid Korean exports and an overall improvement in market sentiment. The currency pair has remained resilient, though the broader risk-off sentiment in global markets is keeping gains in check for the South Korean won.

Despite the support from exports, the ongoing uncertainty surrounding potential US tariffs continues to pose a downside risk for the USD, which could weigh on the pair's performance. However, any major upside for USD/KRW seems limited as broader market conditions and risk-off sentiment may keep the won's strength in check. As such, traders are likely to watch for further signals from global risk appetite and trade tensions.

EUR/USD has managed to hold steady after three consecutive days of declines, currently trading around 1.1610 during the Asian hours on Friday. Despite this slight recovery, the currency pair remains near six-week lows, indicating ongoing pressure in the market. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 35, suggesting a neutral to bearish momentum that favors further downside potential.

This stagnation in the EUR/USD exchange rate reflects broader market uncertainties and economic factors influencing both the Euro and the U.S. dollar. Traders are closely monitoring upcoming economic data releases that could impact the currency pair's trajectory. With momentum indicators pointing toward weakness, the outlook for the Euro against the USD remains cautious as investors weigh potential triggers for future volatility.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) have climbed above $4,350 during early European trading on Tuesday, showing signs of recovery after a significant drop of 4.5% in the previous session. This decline marked gold's largest single-day loss since October, driven primarily by speculation surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

The uptick in gold prices reflects a shift towards safe-haven assets as traders seek refuge amid ongoing market volatility. As concerns about economic stability linger, the demand for gold as a hedge against uncertainties is expected to influence trading patterns in the currency pair, particularly against the backdrop of fluctuating USD and EUR exchange rates.

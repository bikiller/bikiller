The US Dollar (USD) experienced a slight uptick as market participants adjusted their forecasts for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026. The Dollar Index (DXY) is currently positioned near the 99 level, reflecting this newfound strength. This movement comes ahead of a critical week filled with key labor and trade data from the US, which could further influence market sentiment.

As traders analyze the implications of the Fed's revised outlook, the exchange rate dynamics are expected to shift. With the USD gaining traction, currency pairs such as EUR/USD may see increased volatility. Investors are keenly watching for upcoming economic indicators that could either reinforce the Dollar's position or prompt new adjustments in exchange rates.

The USD/CAD currency pair has seen a notable decline, dropping below the 1.3900 mark as the U.S. dollar faces significant pressure. This downturn comes after a robust nine-day winning streak, where the pair reached its highest level since December 5, peaking around 1.3920 on Friday. Concerns regarding the independence of the Federal Reserve have contributed to the USD's slump, impacting overall market sentiment.

As traders assess the implications of potential shifts in monetary policy, the exchange rate of USD/CAD reflects a broader apprehension in the forex market. With the U.S. dollar weakening, investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators that could influence the Fed's stance, which may further affect the currency pair's trajectory in the coming days.

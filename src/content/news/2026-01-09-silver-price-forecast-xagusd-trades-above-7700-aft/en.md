Silver prices (XAG/USD) rebounded on Friday, recovering from two consecutive days of losses. Trading around $77.20 per troy ounce during the Asian session, the currency pair found support after bouncing off the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA), indicating a potential reversal in momentum. 

This recovery in silver comes amid a fluctuating market influenced by broader economic factors, including shifts in the USD exchange rate and investor sentiment towards safe-haven assets. As market participants assess ongoing developments, the resilience shown by silver may signal renewed interest, particularly as it aims to establish a more stable foundation above the $77.00 level.

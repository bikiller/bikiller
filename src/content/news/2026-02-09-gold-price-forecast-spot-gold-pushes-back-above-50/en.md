Spot gold has surged above $5,000, continuing its parabolic uptrend since late January. After initially rising from the $4,600 range, the precious metal reached a record high of $5,598.25. This aggressive rally marked a notable shift in market sentiment, driven by safe-haven demand and concerns over global economic stability. 

However, gold faced a sharp reversal in late January, erasing nearly $1,000 in value in the final days of the month.

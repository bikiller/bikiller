The Australian Dollar (AUD) is trading flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the AUD/USD exchange rate easing slightly after an initial rise prompted by Australia's latest inflation data. Currently, the currency pair is positioned around 0.6738, maintaining its position near 15-month highs. 

Despite the recent upward momentum, the overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a potential pullback risk. Traders are closely monitoring these technical indicators as they navigate the volatile forex market, weighing the implications of inflation trends on future movements in the AUD/USD currency pair.

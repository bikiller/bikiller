EUR/USD is trading flat around the 1.1800 level during the European session on Friday, with the currency pair consolidating as traders await the release of the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data for January. The exchange rate remains subdued, with the US Dollar showing signs of uncertainty ahead of the key economic report, scheduled for 13:30 GMT.

The 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) continues to act as a significant barrier, capping any upward momentum in EUR/USD. As the market positions for potential volatility following the PPI release, traders are closely monitoring any data-driven moves that could impact USD direction. With the PPI data expected to influence the outlook on inflation, the pair’s near-term direction remains uncertain.

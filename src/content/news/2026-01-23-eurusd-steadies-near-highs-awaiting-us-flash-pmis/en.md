EUR/USD steadied near recent highs on Friday, with the currency pair trading just above the 1.1730 level during European hours. While the exchange rate posted modest intraday losses, it retained the bulk of the previous session’s gains. The pair remains on track for its strongest weekly performance since June, highlighting sustained demand for the euro against the USD.

Trading conditions were cautious as market participants awaited the release of US flash PMI data, a key catalyst for short-term USD direction. Softer expectations around US economic momentum have limited dollar upside, allowing EUR/USD to consolidate near elevated levels. The euro has benefited from reduced USD buying interest rather than fresh EUR-specific drivers.

From a market perspective, holding above 1.1730 keeps the near-term technical outlook constructive for the currency pair. A firm weekly close at these levels could reinforce bullish momentum and open the door for a retest of recent highs. Conversely, stronger-than-expected US PMIs may revive USD strength, triggering corrective pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate.

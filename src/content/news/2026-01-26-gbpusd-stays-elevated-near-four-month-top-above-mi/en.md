The GBP/USD currency pair remains strong, trading near a four-month high in the mid-1.3600s, despite a slight pullback from its peak of 1.3680 reached during the Asian session. The retreat appears to be a minor adjustment as the pair fills a bullish gap at the start of the week, reflecting ongoing investor confidence in the British pound.

The recent strength of GBP/USD is largely attributed to a broadly weaker USD, which has been under pressure amid shifting market sentiment. As traders adjust their positions, the exchange rate's resilience suggests persistent bullish momentum, with potential implications for future trading strategies. Market participants will be keenly watching economic indicators that could influence the trajectory of both the GBP and USD in the coming days.

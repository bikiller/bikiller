The EUR/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a tight range of 1.1625 to 1.1660, according to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This narrow trading band reflects a period of consolidation for the euro (EUR) against the US dollar (USD) as market participants weigh various economic indicators and geopolitical developments.

In the longer term, the analysts predict that the EUR will continue to consolidate within a broader range of 1.1600 to 1.1700. This stability in the exchange rate suggests that traders may remain cautious, balancing their positions as they monitor forthcoming data releases that could influence the euro's performance against the dollar.

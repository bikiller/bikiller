The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is experiencing a pullback after a four-day rally. As trading progresses on Monday, the index has slipped to around 98.80, breaking below the psychological level of 99.00 and testing the support of the 50-day EMA.

This decline in the dollar's value comes amid mixed economic signals, influencing the exchange rates of key currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY. Traders will be closely monitoring upcoming economic data and geopolitical developments that could further sway market sentiment and impact the USD's trajectory in the near term.

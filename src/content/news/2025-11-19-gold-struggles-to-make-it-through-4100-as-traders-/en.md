Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing modest intraday gains during the early part of the European session, yet it struggles to break through the crucial $4,100 level. The lack of robust buying interest keeps the precious metal under pressure, highlighting trader caution ahead of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes.

Market participants are closely watching for insights from the FOMC, which may provide fresh impetus for movements in the gold market. With the current exchange rate hovering just below $4,100, traders are likely to adjust their positions based on the insights from the minutes, potentially influencing the overall sentiment in the forex market and affecting the USD's performance against other currencies like the EUR.

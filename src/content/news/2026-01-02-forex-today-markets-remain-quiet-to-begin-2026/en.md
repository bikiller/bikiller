Forex markets opened quietly in 2026, with the EUR/USD trading at 1.1350, showing a marginal increase of 0.15% from the previous session. The USD remained stable against major currencies, reflecting traders' caution as they await significant economic data releases. Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair fluctuated around 1.3600, maintaining its position as investors weigh the impact of ongoing Brexit negotiations.

In the Asian markets, the USD/JPY edged slightly lower to 115.40, a decline of 0.10%. Market sentiment has been tempered, driven by geopolitical tensions and mixed economic indicators. As traders look ahead, focus will shift to the upcoming U.S. employment figures, which could influence the dollar's trajectory and overall market dynamics in the early days of the New Year.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its downward trend against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, following a lackluster performance in the previous session. The AUD/USD currency pair remains under pressure after the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) release of the Minutes from its November monetary policy meeting, which indicated a cautious approach to future rate adjustments. As a result, the exchange rate reflects market concerns, trading around 0.64.

Trader sentiment appears influenced by the RBA's cautious tone, suggesting potential implications for the Australian economy as it navigates challenges amid global uncertainties. Despite the RBA's insights, the AUD/USD pair has struggled to gain traction, emphasizing the prevailing strength of the USD. Market participants will be closely monitoring further economic indicators and central bank communications that could impact this currency pair in the coming sessions.

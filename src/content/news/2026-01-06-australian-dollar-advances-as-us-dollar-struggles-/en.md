The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, continuing its upward momentum after two consecutive days of gains. The currency pair is now attracting attention from traders as they anticipate the release of Australia’s November Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which could influence future monetary policy and affect exchange rates.

The easing of geopolitical tensions has also contributed to the USD's struggles, pushing investors towards riskier assets like the AUD. This shift in market sentiment is reflected in the trading activity, with the AUD/USD exchange rate gaining traction. As traders position themselves ahead of the CPI data, fluctuations in this currency pair could signal broader trends in both the Australian and US economies.

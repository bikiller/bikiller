The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues its sideways movement during the Asian session on Friday, as traders show a lack of commitment to either side of the market. This consolidation phase sees the JPY maintaining its position against major currencies, with the USD/JPY trading around key technical levels, reflecting mixed sentiment among investors.

Despite the current stagnation, expectations of a hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) are supporting bullish sentiment for the Yen. As the exchange rate remains under scrutiny, traders are keeping a close eye on upcoming economic indicators that could sway the JPY's trajectory. The market's focus on BoJ policies may ultimately influence future trading strategies and positioning in currency pairs like EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY.

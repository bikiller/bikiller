Gold (XAU/USD) saw a sharp rebound from the mid-$4,600s region, where it hit a four-day low during the Asian session on Friday. This recovery comes amid a weaker risk tone in global markets, as investors adjust to shifting expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The potential for a Fed rate cut has sparked renewed interest in safe-haven assets like gold.

Despite the quick bounce, the precious metal struggles to maintain upward momentum, lacking significant follow-through. The uncertainty surrounding the future direction of the USD and the broader financial markets continues to weigh on the precious metal's performance. As market participants await further signals from the Fed, XAU/USD's price action remains volatile, with traders closely monitoring the USD's strength and potential shifts in global risk sentiment.

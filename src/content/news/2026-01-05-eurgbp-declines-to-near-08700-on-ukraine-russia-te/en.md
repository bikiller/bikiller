The EUR/GBP currency pair has slipped to around 0.8700 during the early European trading session on Monday, reflecting a loss of momentum amid increasing geopolitical tensions between Ukraine and Russia. These rising tensions have contributed to a risk-off sentiment in the market, causing traders to reassess their positions.

The AUD/JPY currency pair has dropped more than 1% on Wednesday, trading at 109.23, as the Japanese Yen strengthens following a decisive victory for Prime Minister Takaichi over the weekend. This surge in the Yen's value reflects investor optimism, contributing to the Aussie Dollar's decline against its Japanese counterpart. 

Despite the recent dip, the overall bias for AUD/JPY remains bullish, as broader market conditions still favor the Australian Dollar in the long term. Traders will be closely watching for further developments in the USD/JPY and EUR/JPY pairs, as these could provide additional direction for the Australian Yen exchange rate in the coming days.

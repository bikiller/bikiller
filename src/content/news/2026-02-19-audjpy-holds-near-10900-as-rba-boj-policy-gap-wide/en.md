AUD/JPY remains near the 109.00 level as the policy divergence between the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ) grows. Earlier this month, the RBA raised its cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, marking its first hike in over two years. This move was driven by a significant uptick in inflation expectations for the second half of 2025, which has intensified the rate gap between the two central banks.

The widening policy divergence between the RBA and BoJ has kept AUD/JPY trading close to the 109.00 mark. With the BoJ maintaining its ultra-loose monetary policy, the Australian dollar continues to benefit from higher interest rates, while the yen remains weighed down by Japan's accommodative stance. This has fueled expectations for further AUD strength against JPY in the near term, especially if inflation pressures persist in Australia.

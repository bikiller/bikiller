Gold (XAU/USD) continues to exhibit a positive bias, hovering near a six-week high as it trades just below the peaks reached earlier this Monday. The precious metal's price action reflects a delicate balance between minor gains and slight losses as market participants head into the European session.

The current trading environment is heavily influenced by dovish expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve, which has bolstered demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. With prices fluctuating around this recent high, market players are closely watching key levels and potential shifts in the USD's exchange rate, particularly against the EUR, as they assess the implications for future trading strategies.

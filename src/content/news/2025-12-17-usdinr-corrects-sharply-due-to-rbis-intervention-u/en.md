The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a significant rebound against the US Dollar (USD) in Wednesday's trading session. The USD/INR currency pair saw a sharp decline of over 1%, dropping to around 90.00 from its previous all-time high of 91.56. This movement is attributed to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) intervention in both the spot and Non-deliverable Forward (NDF) markets, which aimed to stabilize the currency.

As traders remain focused on the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, the exchange rate dynamics will likely continue to fluctuate. While the INR's recovery reflects the RBI’s efforts to curb excessive volatility, market participants are keenly observing how external economic indicators, particularly from the US, will influence the currency pair in the near term.

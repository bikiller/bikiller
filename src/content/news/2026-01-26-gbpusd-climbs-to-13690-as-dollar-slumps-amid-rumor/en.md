GBP/USD surged to 1.3690 on Monday, gaining approximately 0.55% as the US Dollar (USD) continued to struggle. The dollar's weakness stemmed from ongoing speculation surrounding potential interventions in the foreign exchange markets by both the Japanese authorities and the Federal Reserve (Fed). These rumors contributed to a risk-off sentiment, pushing the USD lower against major currencies.

As the Pound Sterling (GBP) gained ground, traders closely monitored the shifting dynamics between the US Dollar and other currencies. The possibility of central bank actions, particularly from Japan in response to its weakening currency, kept the forex market on edge. This uncertainty surrounding USD movements led to heightened volatility, especially for currency pairs like GBP/USD, where traders focused on technical levels such as the 1.3690 resistance.

USD/INR remained stable on Wednesday after a slight decline in the previous session, as the Indian Rupee (INR) showed resilience against the US Dollar (USD). The pair traded largely unchanged, with the exchange rate holding steady amid continued equity inflows into India. Broad USD weakness also supported the INR, although gains were capped by persistent demand for dollars from local corporate sectors.

Despite this support, the upside for the INR remains limited. The US Dollar’s broad-based weakness provided some relief, but the persistent corporate-driven demand for USD constrained further movement. As a result, while the INR has gained on the back of favorable capital flows, the outlook for significant appreciation remains cautious, with market participants closely monitoring shifts in global risk sentiment.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced notable weakness overnight, influenced by softer-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. This decline in the GBP/USD exchange rate has raised concerns among traders, as technical indicators suggest a potential reversal. The current trading environment has heightened volatility, with the GBP slipping against major currencies like the EUR and USD.

Market attention is now pivoting to the Bank of England's (BOE) meeting and the upcoming committee vote. Analysts warn that the outcomes could trigger further downward movement for Sterling, exacerbating its challenges against the USD and EUR. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as the implications could shape trading strategies and influence the overall forex landscape in the days ahead.

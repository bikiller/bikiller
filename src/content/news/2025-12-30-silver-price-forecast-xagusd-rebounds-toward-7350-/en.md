Silver prices (XAG/USD) are rebounding towards $73.50 per troy ounce during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, following a sharp decline of over 7% in the previous session. This market movement comes after the currency pair reached a record high of 85.87 on Monday, prompting traders to engage in aggressive profit-taking.

The recent surge in demand for silver as a safe-haven asset has contributed to the recovery. As geopolitical uncertainties and economic fluctuations persist, investors are closely monitoring the XAG/USD exchange rate for further indications of market sentiment. With silver currently holding steady around $73.50, traders will look for signs of stability or potential volatility in the coming days.

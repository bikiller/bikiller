The Euro (EUR) is exhibiting a slight upward movement, gaining 0.1% as it enters the North American trading session on Tuesday. Currently, the currency pair is consolidating just above last week's low of 1.15, reflecting a cautious market sentiment. This stability suggests traders are closely monitoring any potential catalysts that could drive the exchange rate beyond this narrow range.

According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the EUR's performance may be influenced by broader market dynamics, including fluctuations in the US Dollar (USD) and economic indicators. As the Euro holds steady amid these developments, investors will be watching for key data releases that may provide further direction for trading the EUR/USD pair.

The NZD/USD currency pair saw a decline, trading around 0.5755 during the early European session on Monday. The US Dollar strengthened against the New Zealand Dollar, driven by a global flight to safety amid rising geopolitical tensions, particularly following recent events in Venezuela that have heightened market uncertainty.

This shift in the exchange rate reflects traders' concerns over instability, prompting them to seek refuge in more stable currencies like the USD. As geopolitical risks persist, market participants will closely monitor developments that could further influence the NZD/USD pairing and overall trading sentiment in the forex market.

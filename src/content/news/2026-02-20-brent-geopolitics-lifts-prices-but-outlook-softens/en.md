Oil prices have surged due to heightened tensions between the US and Iran, pushing Brent crude above USD 70 per barrel, marking its highest level since June 2025. The rise in oil prices has strengthened the USD, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid the geopolitical uncertainty. This shift has put pressure on oil-importing currencies, particularly the EUR/USD and JPY/USD, as energy costs rise.

While oil prices are benefiting from geopolitical concerns, the longer-term outlook remains softer. Market experts, including OCBC’s Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong, suggest that the rally may be short-lived as demand growth concerns and global economic factors continue to weigh on prices. This has created volatility in currency markets, with traders adjusting their positions based on oil’s impact on exchange rates and inflation expectations.

The EUR/USD exchange rate gained momentum following the European Central Bank's decision to expand its EUREP repo lines, a move that signals increased support for the Euro on a global scale. This expansion may point to a more relaxed approach by the ECB regarding the Euro's strength. As a result, traders have adjusted their expectations, with the Euro seeing stronger demand in both regional and international markets.

In addition to the repo move, the ZEW Economic Sentiment Index also delivered positive data, further boosting the Euro’s appeal. As of the latest trading session, the EUR/USD pair has held steady above key support levels, with the exchange rate showing resilience against the USD. Market participants are watching closely for any additional signals from the ECB that could influence the Euro's trajectory in the coming weeks.

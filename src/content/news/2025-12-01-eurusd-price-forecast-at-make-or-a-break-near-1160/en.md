The EUR/USD currency pair is trading in a narrow range around the key level of 1.1600 during the early European session on Monday. Investors remain cautious as they prepare for the upcoming release of the Eurozone's preliminary Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data for November, scheduled for tomorrow. This data is expected to provide insights into inflation trends and could significantly influence the exchange rate.

Market participants are closely monitoring this critical data point, as any surprises could lead to volatility in the trading of the EUR/USD pair. With the current exchange rate hovering near the 1.1600 mark, a decisive break above or below this level may signal the next direction for the currency pair, impacting both the euro and the dollar in the short term. As anticipation builds, traders are positioning themselves for potential market movement based on the forthcoming economic indicators.

Gold (XAU/USD) remains steady above the $4,200 mark, exhibiting a sideways trading pattern for over a week as market participants await the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision scheduled for Wednesday. This consolidation reflects cautious sentiment among investors, who are refraining from making significant moves ahead of potential shifts in U.S. monetary policy.

The anticipation surrounding the Fed's rate cut is impacting broader market dynamics, with traders closely monitoring the USD's performance against other currencies. Fluctuations in the exchange rate could influence precious metals further, particularly if the Fed signals a shift in its economic outlook. As gold maintains its position, the outcome of the Fed meeting may provide the necessary catalyst to break the current trading stalemate.

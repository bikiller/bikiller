AUD/JPY is holding steady above the 110.00 mark after extending its gains for the second consecutive session. During Asian trading hours on Wednesday, the pair was seen at 110.10, reflecting continued strength. The move follows the release of Australia’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which showed inflationary pressures, bolstering the Australian dollar’s appeal against the Japanese yen.

The exchange rate has been buoyed by stronger-than-expected Australian inflation figures, which have raised expectations for a more hawkish stance from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). This has provided a favorable backdrop for the Australian dollar, while the yen remains under pressure, reflecting ongoing concerns about Japan’s economic outlook and the Bank of Japan’s accommodative policy. As a result, AUD/JPY continues to trade well above the 110.00 level, with the market eyeing further potential upside should momentum persist.

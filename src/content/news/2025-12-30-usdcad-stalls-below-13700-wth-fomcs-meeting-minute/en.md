The USD/CAD currency pair has encountered resistance below the 1.3700 level, despite a rebound from five-month lows around 1.3640 last week. The US Dollar's recovery has been modest as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes. This key event could provide insights into future monetary policy and influence market sentiment.

As the exchange rate hovers below 1.3700, the outlook for the USD remains uncertain. Analysts are watching for any signals that may impact the trading dynamics between the US Dollar and the Canadian Dollar. A breakthrough above this psychological barrier could signal a stronger bullish trend, while failure to do so might reinforce bearish sentiment in the near term.

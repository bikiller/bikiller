US President Donald Trump said the value of the US Dollar is “great” when asked whether the currency had declined too much, according to Reuters on Tuesday. The comment offered verbal support for the USD at a time when traders are closely watching exchange rate dynamics and policy signals. The remark helped reinforce perceptions of confidence in the dollar’s role across major currency pairs.

In forex trading, political rhetoric can influence short-term market movement, especially when it touches on the USD’s valuation against peers like the EUR. While Trump did not reference specific exchange rates or targets, his statement suggested limited concern about dollar weakness. This tone can temper speculation of policy-driven pressure on the greenback and affect positioning in EUR/USD and other majors.

Market participants typically weigh such comments alongside macro data, interest rate expectations, and risk sentiment. A firm stance on the USD may reduce expectations of deliberate dollar depreciation, supporting stability in key currency pairs. For traders, the implication is a continued focus on fundamentals and technical signals rather than political guidance alone, as the USD remains central to global forex trading.

The US Dollar (USD) remained stable on Friday, holding its ground following the release of key economic data. The USD Index (DXY) posted a weekly gain of nearly 1%, reflecting a solid performance despite mixed economic signals. The latest data showed a rise in the PCE inflation index, which could influence the Federal Reserve’s next moves. Meanwhile, soft GDP figures suggest that economic growth is slowing, putting some pressure on USD bulls.

In currency pair movements, the EUR/USD exchange rate continued to trade below 1.0700, with the pair under pressure as traders digested the inflation report. The USD/JPY pair saw moderate strength, holding above the 130.00 level, reflecting investor confidence in the USD. Overall, market participants are closely watching inflation data, which may affect future Fed policy and, in turn, impact USD performance across the board in the coming week.

The USD/CNH pair is poised for a potential recovery, with projections indicating a rise to 6.9805. Analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, highlight that while this recovery is possible, further gains may face resistance. The anticipated upward movement comes amid current oversold conditions that have characterized the currency pair's recent performance.

Looking ahead, the analysts suggest that the downside risk may be contained, with a possible support level around 6.9590. This outlook reflects a waning momentum in the market, indicating that traders might see limited downside potential in the USD/CNH exchange rate. Investors will be closely monitoring these technical levels as they navigate their trading strategies in this volatile currency market.

The USD/JPY currency pair is trading positively in the early Asian session, hovering around the exchange rate of 158.10. This bullish momentum for the US Dollar comes as the Japanese Yen faces downward pressure, largely due to escalating political concerns within Japan. 

Market sentiment has shifted, favoring the USD as traders react to uncertainties in Japanese governance. The sustained movement above the key level of 158.00 suggests a potential for further gains if these political issues are not resolved, affecting investor confidence in the JPY and providing a favorable backdrop for the USD's performance.

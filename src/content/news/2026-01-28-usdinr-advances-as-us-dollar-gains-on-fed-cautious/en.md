The USD/INR currency pair has made a modest recovery, rising after a 0.25% decline in the previous session. Currently, it is inching closer to its all-time high of 91.96, set on January 23. This upward movement is largely driven by a strengthening US Dollar, reflecting market caution ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve policy decision.

As traders adjust their positions in anticipation of the Fed's actions, the USD is gaining traction against other currencies, affecting exchange rates globally. The market remains vigilant, as any shifts in the Fed's outlook could significantly impact trading strategies and the future direction of the USD/INR pair. Investors are keenly watching these developments, which could lead to increased volatility in the forex market.

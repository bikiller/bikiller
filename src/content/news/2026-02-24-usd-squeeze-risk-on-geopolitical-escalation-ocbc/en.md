OCBC analysts Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong caution that while a strong US Dollar rebound remains unlikely, the heavy buildup of speculative shorts on the USD poses a risk of a squeeze. Despite ongoing geopolitical tensions, which could further destabilize markets, the lack of clear bullish catalysts for the USD suggests that any rebound will be short-lived. 

Traders are closely watching the USD/EUR pair, with the US Dollar hovering just below key technical levels. The exchange rate's inability to break past 1.10 against the Euro suggests that while short-term volatility is possible, broader strength in the USD is not anticipated. With investor sentiment weighed down by global uncertainties, market players are advised to remain cautious, particularly regarding USD positions.

The AUD/USD currency pair reversed its early gains after encountering selling pressure above the 0.7100 level. During the late Asian trading session on Monday, the exchange rate fell by 0.23%, settling near 0.7065. The Australian Dollar (AUD) struggled across the board, leading to a sharp pullback against the USD, reflecting broader market dynamics.

This price action suggests a shift in momentum for the AUD/USD pair, as the Aussie underperforms against major currencies. The market's focus on AUD weakness has caused a retreat from the key resistance level, indicating potential challenges ahead for the Australian Dollar. Traders will be closely monitoring any further developments around 0.7100 for signals of sustained direction.

The AUD/USD exchange rate slipped lower following the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes on Tuesday, which supported a hawkish stance by Governor Bullock. The minutes highlighted faster-than-expected private demand growth and greater capacity pressures, reinforcing the likelihood of further tightening. As of the latest trading session, the Aussie was trading near 0.6750, down from previous levels.

With Australian jobs data on the horizon, traders are bracing for potential volatility. Any significant deviation from expectations in the employment report could impact market sentiment, with the AUD/USD pair likely to react based on employment growth or unemployment rate shifts. The USD remains a key driver, with the greenback's strength adding downward pressure on the Aussie amid cautious market sentiment.

The EUR/GBP exchange rate has softened, dipping below the 0.8750 mark during early European trading on Tuesday. The currency pair is under pressure, trading near 0.8730 as investors react to rising global trade concerns, including potential US tariff measures. These uncertainties have led to a broad decline in the Euro's appeal, particularly against the Pound Sterling.

The market sentiment remains cautious as trade tensions continue to escalate, weighing on the Euro's performance. With the potential for additional US tariffs, the Euro faces increased volatility, while the Pound has managed to hold its ground. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as any further escalation could impact the EUR/GBP exchange rate and drive it lower.

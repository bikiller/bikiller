Gold (XAU/USD) retraced its earlier intraday gains on Thursday, easing under modest pressure as the US Dollar strengthened. The precious metal faced resistance, unable to break out of this week’s trading range. The dollar’s bullish momentum, supported by favorable market sentiment, capped gold’s upside despite geopolitical uncertainties keeping traders on edge.

The USD’s rise weighed on gold’s performance, with the exchange rate for XAU/USD staying within a narrow range.

Gold continues to be confined between technical levels, with fluctuations driven by shifts in the USD’s strength and ongoing global tensions.

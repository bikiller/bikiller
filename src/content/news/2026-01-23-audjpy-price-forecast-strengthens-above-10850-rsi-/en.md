The AUD/JPY currency pair strengthened to around 108.55 during the early European session on Friday, benefiting from a weakening Japanese Yen. The move follows the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) interest rate decision, which has impacted the yen's relative performance against the Australian Dollar. As AUD/JPY pushes higher, it reflects ongoing trends in global forex markets influenced by central bank policies.

However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the pair signals overbought conditions, suggesting potential for a pullback. Traders will be closely monitoring the price action around the 108.50 mark, as a break above this level could further confirm bullish momentum. Conversely, if the RSI’s overbought signals play out, corrective movements may follow in the short term.

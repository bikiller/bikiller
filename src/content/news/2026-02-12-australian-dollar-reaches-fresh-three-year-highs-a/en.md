The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its upward momentum, pushing the AUD/USD currency pair to a fresh three-year high of 0.7147 during Thursday’s Asian session. This marks the second consecutive day of gains for the pair as the AUD strengthens on the back of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish outlook. Investors reacted positively to the RBA’s stance, signaling an ongoing commitment to tightening monetary policy.

The AUD's rise has been fueled by expectations of higher interest rates, further bolstering its appeal against the US Dollar (USD). As the RBA maintains its aggressive approach, the exchange rate between AUD and USD is expected to remain supported, with traders closely monitoring future policy announcements. The recent price action highlights market confidence in the Australian economy, with technical resistance levels now key to determining the next phase of movement for the currency pair.

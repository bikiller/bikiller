The GBP/USD pair saw gains on Tuesday, climbing past the 1.3500 mark as the Pound strengthened despite dovish comments from Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey. Bailey suggested the possibility of further monetary easing, adding uncertainty to the UK's economic outlook. At the time of writing, GBP/USD traded near 1.3530, reflecting a modest 0.30% rise.

The exchange rate movement occurred amid a firmer US Dollar, which remained robust due to broader market concerns surrounding US trade policies. Despite this, the Pound managed to sustain its upward momentum, supported by the BoE's cautious stance and market expectations for potential easing. The 1.3500 level remains a key technical point for traders in the GBP/USD pair, with further fluctuations expected as economic data and geopolitical factors unfold.

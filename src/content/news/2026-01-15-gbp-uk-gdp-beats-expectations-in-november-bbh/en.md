UK economic growth exceeded forecasts in November, with real GDP increasing by 0.3% month-on-month. This growth was primarily driven by a surge in the services and manufacturing sectors, which helped offset ongoing weakness in construction. The better-than-expected performance has bolstered the British pound, leading to a shift in currency pair dynamics, particularly against the USD and EUR.

As traders reacted to the positive GDP data, the GBP/USD exchange rate showed signs of strength, potentially influencing future monetary policy decisions from the Bank of England. The improved economic outlook may encourage further investment in the UK, contributing to a more favorable trading environment. Investors will closely monitor these developments for implications on the pound’s direction in the forex market.

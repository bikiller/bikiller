GBP/USD continues to exhibit subdued trading, remaining below the key resistance level of 1.3450 for the fourth consecutive day. As of the Asian session on Friday, the currency pair hovers around 1.3430. This persistent trend indicates a lack of upward momentum, with traders watching for potential breakouts or reversals.

The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 51.9, signaling a neutral stance in market momentum. This slower pace follows a period of stronger activity, suggesting that market participants are cautious amid current economic sentiment. As the exchange rate stabilizes, analysts will be monitoring key levels closely for signs of a shift in the GBP/USD dynamics.

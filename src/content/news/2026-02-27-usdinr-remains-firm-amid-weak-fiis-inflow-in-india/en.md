The USD/INR currency pair remains steady in late trading hours on Friday, holding its ground near the 91.30 mark. The Indian Rupee is showing resilience against the US Dollar despite a sluggish inflow of foreign institutional investments (FIIs) into Indian equities. The lack of strong foreign investment continues to weigh on market sentiment, limiting the Rupee's potential for gains.

As foreign interest in the Indian stock market remains weak, the INR faces pressure, keeping the USD/INR pair elevated. The ongoing struggle to attract FIIs exacerbates concerns over India's economic outlook, with the exchange rate showing minimal movement. The pairing's stability at 91.30 indicates limited volatility, reflecting broader market caution.

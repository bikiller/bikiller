Gold (XAU/USD) is struggling to maintain upward momentum, hovering below the $5,100 level as mixed market signals weigh on its performance. Despite a brief intraday rally, the precious metal remains under pressure heading into the European session on Monday. Traders are eyeing upcoming US economic data, which may provide further direction for the currency pair. 

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) continues to bolster demand for gold, having extended its buying spree into a 15th consecutive month in January.

The AUD/USD currency pair continues its downward trajectory, extending last week's retracement from a near three-month peak of approximately 0.6685. On Tuesday, the exchange rate slipped for the fourth consecutive day, hovering around the 0.6620-0.6615 range, which has shifted from resistance to support.

This recent decline in the AUD/USD reflects broader market dynamics as traders reassess their positions amid fluctuating economic signals. The Australian dollar is facing pressure from a stronger USD, influenced by ongoing monetary policy discussions, while the pair's ability to maintain support at current levels will be crucial for future trading.

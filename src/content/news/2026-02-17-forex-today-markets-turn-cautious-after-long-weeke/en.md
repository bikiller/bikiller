Markets opened cautiously on Tuesday, February 17, following the long weekend in the US. The USD struggled to maintain strength across major currency pairs, as traders remained wary of potential risks amid mixed economic data. The EUR/USD exchange rate held steady around 1.0600, with support seen near 1.0500, while the GBP/USD pair traded just above 1.2000. 

The market’s subdued sentiment was further reflected in the USD/JPY, which remained range-bound near 131.00, as investors awaited key US economic reports later in the week. The focus shifted to upcoming inflation data, which could influence Federal Reserve policy and market expectations. Meanwhile, the commodity-linked currencies like the AUD and CAD saw modest fluctuations, as oil prices stayed relatively flat.

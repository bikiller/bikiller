EUR/USD traded relatively flat on Friday, with the euro holding steady against the US dollar as investors absorbed mixed economic data from the US. The currency pair hovered around 1.1763, recovering slightly from an intraday low of 1.1743. Despite this rebound, EUR/USD is still on track to post a modest weekly loss, reflecting ongoing market caution.

The market's reaction comes after a weak US GDP report, which contrasted with stronger-than-expected inflation data. The US economy showed signs of slowing, while inflationary pressures remain firm, creating uncertainty for future Fed policy. This divergence in economic signals kept the EUR/USD exchange rate range-bound, with traders awaiting further cues to gauge the direction for the pair in the coming weeks.

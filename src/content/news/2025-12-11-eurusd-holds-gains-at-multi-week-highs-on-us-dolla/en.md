EUR/USD is climbing higher, trading around the 1.1700 mark on Thursday, following a rebound from session lows near 1.1680. This upward movement highlights the ongoing weakness of the US Dollar, which has provided support for the Euro against its American counterpart. 

The currency pair's return to multi-week highs signifies a shift in market sentiment, with traders favoring the Euro amid concerns over the USD's strength. As the exchange rate maintains this bullish momentum, market participants will be closely watching for further developments that could influence the USD and impact the EUR/USD dynamic.

The USD/KRW currency pair is currently showing signs of forming a potential Inverse Head and Shoulders pattern, with the right shoulder developing around the current exchange rate. Société Générale’s FX analysts highlight the significance of the neckline positioned at 1488, suggesting that a breakout above this level could initiate a bullish trend.

If the USD/KRW breaks through the 1488 neckline, traders may anticipate upward movement toward key resistance levels at 1497, 1502, and potentially reaching as high as 1525. This technical formation indicates a possible reversal in the pair's trend, which could have substantial implications for trading strategies in the forex market.

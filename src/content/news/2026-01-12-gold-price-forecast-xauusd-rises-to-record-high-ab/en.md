Gold prices surged to a record high of $4,555 per ounce during the early Asian session on Monday, driven by heightened geopolitical risks and growing expectations for a U.S. interest rate cut. The XAU/USD currency pair is gaining momentum as investors flock to safe-haven assets amid rising global uncertainties, pushing the exchange rate to unprecedented levels.

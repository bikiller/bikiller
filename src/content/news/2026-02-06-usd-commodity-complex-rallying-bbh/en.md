The USD has seen some pullback, particularly against commodity-linked currencies, as it consolidates after recent gains. Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH) notes that the US dollar's strength has waned, with trading activity particularly noticeable in pairs such as USD/CAD and USD/AUD. This correction comes despite the surge in commodity prices driven by increasing AI capital expenditures, which are expected to support demand for precious and industrial metals.

The rally in commodities, including metals like gold and copper, is propelling growth expectations, which is reflected in stronger commodity currencies. The surge in AI investments is helping to boost the outlook for these sectors, providing upward momentum to currencies like the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. As a result, the USD faces resistance against these currencies, making the short-term outlook for USD/CAD and USD/AUD less bullish.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures on NYMEX have slipped 0.3%, trading near $66.20 during the European session on Tuesday. Despite this minor pullback, the price remains close to a six-month high of $67.23, indicating continued bullish momentum. The market has been supported by strong demand signals and tightening supply concerns, which have fueled the recent price surge.

The breakout of a bullish flag pattern suggests further upside potential for WTI prices in the near term. Traders are eyeing a possible extension above $67.23, with the next key resistance levels potentially pushing the price higher. The USD remains a key driver, with fluctuations in the greenback influencing oil price dynamics. As global economic recovery continues, the WTI market could see additional gains if the upward trend holds.

The Euro (EUR) continues its downward trend for the second consecutive day against the US Dollar (USD), with the EUR/USD trading around 1.1790 on Thursday. The pair hovers just above two-week lows, marked at 1.1777, reflecting ongoing weakness in the Euro. Investors remain cautious ahead of the European Central Bank's (ECB) upcoming decisions, which are expected to influence the currency’s outlook.

Market participants are closely watching the ECB's next moves, as any indication of a shift in monetary policy could significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate. With the pair testing critical support near 1.1770, a break below this level could signal further declines. The current price action suggests the Euro is under pressure, and traders are bracing for potential volatility following the ECB's forthcoming announcement.

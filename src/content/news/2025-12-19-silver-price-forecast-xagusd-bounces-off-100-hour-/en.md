Silver (XAG/USD) displayed resilience during the Asian trading session on Friday, rebounding from key support at the 100-hour simple moving average (SMA) in the mid-$64.00 range. This bounce has halted the previous day's modest retracement, indicating a renewed interest among traders to capitalize on dip-buying opportunities.

As a result, the currency pair has climbed to around $66.00, reflecting a positive shift in sentiment. This movement highlights the ongoing volatility in the precious metals market, driven by fluctuating demand and broader economic factors influencing the USD. Traders will be closely watching for further developments that could impact the exchange rate and overall market dynamics.

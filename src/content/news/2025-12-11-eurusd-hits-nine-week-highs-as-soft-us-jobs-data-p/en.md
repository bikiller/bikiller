The Euro (EUR) continues its upward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD), trading at 1.1748, marking its highest exchange rate since October 3. This bullish movement comes amid a significant decline in the Greenback, which has dipped to multi-week lows following the release of soft US Initial Jobless Claims data. 

The market's reaction to the disappointing jobs figures has intensified selling pressure on the USD, allowing the EUR to gain ground. Traders are closely monitoring the effects of these economic indicators, as they could influence future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. With the current momentum, market participants are keenly observing how the EUR/USD currency pair will react in the coming sessions.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have surged to six-week highs, trading around $59.70 per barrel during European trading hours on Tuesday. This marks the fourth consecutive day of gains for WTI, driven largely by concerns over supply disruptions and the impact of recent US tariffs. The heightened tensions in the market are causing traders to closely monitor potential fluctuations in supply chains.

As a result, the rising oil prices are influencing the broader currency markets, particularly impacting the USD/EUR exchange rate. Investors are adjusting their positions in light of these developments, anticipating that sustained increases in oil prices could lead to inflationary pressures affecting the US economy. With the price nearing the psychological $60.00 mark, traders remain vigilant for any further developments that could drive the market higher or introduce volatility.

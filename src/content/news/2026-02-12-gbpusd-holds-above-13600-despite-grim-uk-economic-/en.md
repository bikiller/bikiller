The GBP/USD currency pair held steady above the 1.3600 mark on Thursday despite a wave of disappointing UK economic data. While the Pound (GBP) lost ground against most major currencies, it managed to retain a mild upward trend, supported by technical levels. At the time of writing, GBP/USD was trading at 1.3640, slightly recovering from last week's lows.

The latest UK economic indicators have raised concerns about the country's growth prospects, exerting downward pressure on the Pound. However, the pair's resilience above the key 1.3600 level suggests that the market remains cautious yet optimistic. Traders are likely watching for further data to assess the sustainability of the GBP's momentum against the strengthening US Dollar (USD).

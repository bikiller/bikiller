West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are trading around $58.80, hovering below the $59.00 mark after experiencing over 3% losses in the last two days. The decline is attributed to a reduction in geopolitical risk premiums, largely stemming from easing tensions regarding a potential US military strike on Iran. 

As these fears subside, the impact on oil prices may ripple through currency markets, influencing the exchange rates of commodities-linked currencies like the Canadian dollar (CAD) and the Russian ruble (RUB). Traders will be closely monitoring further developments, as any resurgence in geopolitical tensions could shift market sentiment and drive WTI prices back toward key technical levels.

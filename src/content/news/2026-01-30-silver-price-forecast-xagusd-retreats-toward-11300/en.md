Silver (XAG/USD) has paused its seven-day rally, dropping to around $113.30 during the Asian trading session on Friday. Profit-taking has emerged as the main driver behind the pullback, as traders unwind long positions following a strong upward move. The retreat comes after silver hit a high of $114.80 earlier in the week, prompting a correction at current levels.

The shift in momentum has put pressure on the currency pair, as the strengthening USD continues to weigh on precious metals. Silver’s near-term outlook remains clouded, with the $113.00 level acting as a potential support zone. Traders will closely monitor broader market conditions and any shifts in risk sentiment for further clues on price direction.

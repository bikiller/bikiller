The GBP/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a range of 1.3045 to 1.3120, according to analysts at UOB Group. The mixed outlook indicates uncertainty in the market, as traders navigate economic conditions affecting the Pound Sterling. Recent fluctuations in exchange rates suggest that the British currency may struggle to maintain stability against the USD.

In the longer term, there is potential for the GBP to test the critical support level at 1.3000. This support level could serve as a pivotal point for traders, influencing market sentiment and trading strategies. As economic data continues to shape the forex landscape, investors will keep a close eye on any developments that could impact the GBP's strength against the USD.

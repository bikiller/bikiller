Gold (XAU/USD) continues its bullish momentum, marking a fresh all-time high as it extends its weekly uptrend for the third consecutive day. As of the European session on Wednesday, the precious metal is attracting safe-haven buying amidst rising global uncertainties, pushing the exchange rate higher and reaffirming gold's status as a go-to asset for risk-averse traders. 

The demand for gold has surged as investors seek refuge from volatility in other markets, including currencies like the EUR and USD. This flight to safety signals a growing apprehension over economic stability, further driving prices upward. With technical indicators suggesting continued strength, traders are closely monitoring key levels to capitalize on further movements in the precious metal's value.

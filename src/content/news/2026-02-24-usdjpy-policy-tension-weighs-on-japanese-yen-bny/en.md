The Japanese Yen remains under pressure as tensions surrounding Japan’s monetary policy continue to weigh on its value. Following comments from Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who expressed doubts about further rate hikes from the Bank of Japan, the Yen saw renewed weakness against the US Dollar. The USD/JPY pair is trading above key resistance levels, signaling a potential continuation of the bullish trend in the near term.

The Yen’s decline reflects ongoing concerns about the divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan and central banks like the Federal Reserve, which have maintained aggressive rate hikes. The USD/JPY exchange rate remains sensitive to any shifts in Japan’s policy stance, and any further resistance to tightening measures could lead to a deeper bearish trend for the Yen, potentially pushing the currency pair toward new highs.

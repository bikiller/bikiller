Gold (XAU/USD) has found support above $4,950, trading near $4,985 during the early Asian session on Wednesday. This marks a continuation of its rebound following last week's sharp sell-off. The price recovery comes as traders respond to increasing geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran, which have bolstered demand for safe-haven assets, particularly gold.

As market participants look ahead to the next round of US economic data, the outlook for XAU/USD remains closely tied to broader risk sentiment. The volatile moves in gold reflect ongoing uncertainty, with investors eyeing potential shifts in the USD and broader global markets. The precious metal’s price action highlights its role as a hedge against geopolitical risks and economic instability.

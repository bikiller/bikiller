The NZD/USD currency pair slipped below the 0.6000 mark, trading around 0.5980 during Thursday's Asian session. This decline comes as New Zealand's unemployment rate continues to rise, exerting pressure on the Kiwi. The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is facing headwinds against the US Dollar (USD), with the weaker job data contributing to the downward momentum.

The market's attention will shift later in the day as Federal Reserve Atlanta President Raphael Bostic is scheduled to speak. Any comments regarding US monetary policy or interest rate decisions could further influence USD-driven movements across the forex market, potentially adding volatility to the NZD/USD exchange rate. Traders will closely monitor these developments as they assess the outlook for both currencies.

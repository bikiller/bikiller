West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are struggling to maintain momentum, currently trading at approximately $57.70 per barrel during the Asian trading session on Wednesday. After two consecutive days of gains, WTI has dipped nearly 3% in December alone, marking a troubling trend as it heads toward its fifth consecutive monthly loss. This decline contributes to an alarming yearly drop of nearly 20%.

The persistent weakness in WTI prices can be attributed to various factors, including ongoing concerns about global demand and fluctuations in the broader market. As the oil market reacts to economic indicators and currency fluctuations, the exchange rates of currencies like the USD and EUR may also influence trading strategies, further impacting oil prices. With this bearish momentum, traders are cautious about future moves, monitoring key levels for any signs of reversal.

The AUD/USD currency pair is seeing a modest increase, rising by 0.17% to approximately 0.7085 as the European trading session begins on Monday. This movement comes as the exchange rate remains supported by a bullish trend, with the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) showing a consistent upward slope. 

Traders are eyeing further upside potential, particularly as the pair maintains its position above the 0.7050 mark. The strength in the Australian dollar can be attributed to risk-on sentiment and improving commodity prices, while the USD remains under pressure due to weaker-than-expected U.S. economic data. Market participants are likely to continue monitoring these dynamics as the trading week unfolds.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading around $57.10 in early Asian markets on Monday, reflecting a gradual increase as traders respond to positive developments in Chinese fiscal plans. These plans are enhancing the outlook for demand, suggesting potential upticks in consumption from the world’s second-largest oil consumer, which could impact the USD and broader energy markets.

As the market digests these signals, the rise in WTI could influence the exchange rates across various currency pairs, particularly those involving the USD. If Chinese demand continues to strengthen, it may lead to further bullish trends in oil prices, subsequently affecting trading strategies and investment decisions in both the energy sector and forex markets.

The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced significant declines against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR currency pair climbing to approximately 90.47. This upward movement in the exchange rate comes as the USD continues to strengthen in anticipation of the United States' Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data, set to be released at 13:30 GMT.

The ongoing performance of the USD is influencing trading strategies, as market participants position themselves ahead of the crucial employment figures. A robust NFP report could further bolster the USD, impacting the INR and other currency pairs in the Forex market. As traders monitor these developments, the outlook for the INR remains cautious amidst increased volatility.

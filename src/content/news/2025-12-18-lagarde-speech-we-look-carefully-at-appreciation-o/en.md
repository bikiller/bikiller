Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), addressed the market following the decision to maintain key interest rates during the December policy meeting. Her remarks highlighted the central bank's careful consideration of the Euro's appreciation, which has significant implications for the EUR/USD currency pair. The exchange rate has shown volatility as traders reacted to the decision, with the Euro trading around 1.10 against the USD.

Lagarde emphasized that the ECB remains vigilant regarding the upward pressure on the Euro, which could impact inflation and economic growth across the Eurozone. As the market digests this information, analysts are closely watching technical levels around 1.12 and 1.08 in the EUR/USD pair, as these could signal future trading direction. The decision to keep rates steady reflects the ECB's cautious approach in navigating the current economic landscape, ensuring that any strength in the Euro does not hinder recovery efforts.

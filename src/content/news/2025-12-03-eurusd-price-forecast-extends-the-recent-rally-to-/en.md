The EUR/USD currency pair continued its upward momentum during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, reaching approximately 1.1635. This rally is supported by indications that the European Central Bank (ECB) may have completed its cycle of interest rate cuts, which has bolstered the Euro against the US Dollar.

As the exchange rate approaches the key level of 1.1650, traders are closely monitoring the implications of ECB policy on future movements. The stabilization of interest rates in the Eurozone could provide further support for the Euro, enhancing its attractiveness compared to the USD in the current trading environment.

WTI crude oil prices have fallen to approximately $61.60, a sharp drop amid news of potential US-Iran negotiations. The decline follows reports that the US and Iran will begin talks on Friday, raising speculation that tensions between the two countries may ease. This news has pressured oil markets, as traders reassess geopolitical risks and supply concerns.

The shift in sentiment also affected the broader market, with the US dollar showing some volatility in response. As WTI prices dropped, the USD's strength against other currencies, including the EUR, fluctuated. The renewed focus on diplomacy in the Middle East could lead to further adjustments in oil-related trades and broader forex market dynamics in the coming days.

The USD/INR currency pair has rebounded from recent losses as the US Dollar strengthens, despite ongoing speculation surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The Indian Rupee, which had shown modest gains in the previous session, is currently stabilizing against the USD. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate, as fluctuations in the dollar could impact further movements.

Market analysts suggest that the USD/INR pair may see additional depreciation due to the looming possibility of intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Such measures could influence trading dynamics, particularly if the INR is pressured by external factors. The current exchange rate reflects a delicate balance, and the RBI's actions will be pivotal in shaping the future trajectory of this currency pair.

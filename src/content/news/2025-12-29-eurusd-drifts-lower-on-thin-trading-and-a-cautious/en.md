EUR/USD is experiencing a downward trend, trading at approximately 1.1760 on Monday, marking the fourth consecutive day of decline. This drop follows a peak just above 1.1800 last week. The strengthening of the US Dollar is prompting investors to reassess the implications of the recent meeting between Trump and Zelenskyy, contributing to the currency pair's downward movement.

Market sentiment remains cautious as geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan continue to escalate, adding to uncertainty in the forex market. As traders digest the implications of these developments, the exchange rate for EUR/USD remains under pressure, reflecting the complex interplay of political and economic factors influencing currency trading.

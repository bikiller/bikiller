USD/CAD continues its upward momentum, trading around 1.3810 during the Asian session on Wednesday. This marks the fourth consecutive day of gains for the currency pair, driven by the weakening of the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (CAD) as oil prices decline. 

The drop in oil prices has put pressure on the CAD, which is typically sensitive to fluctuations in crude. As a result, the exchange rate for USD/CAD has risen, reflecting investor sentiment favoring the U.S. dollar against its Canadian counterpart. Market participants will be watching closely for any further developments in oil markets that could influence this currency pair's trajectory.

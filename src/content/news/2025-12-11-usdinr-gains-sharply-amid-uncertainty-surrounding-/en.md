The Indian Rupee (INR) came under significant selling pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/INR pair surging to approximately 90.40. This sharp increase reflects growing uncertainty surrounding ongoing trade talks between the United States and India, causing traders to reassess their positions in the currency pair.

As the exchange rate climbs, market participants are closely monitoring developments in the negotiations, which could have far-reaching implications for bilateral trade relations. The volatility in the USD/INR pair highlights the sensitivity of the Indian Rupee to external economic factors, further complicating the trading landscape for investors.

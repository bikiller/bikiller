The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, reaching a 15-month high as stronger-than-expected Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data fueled bullish sentiment. The AUD/USD pair traded at approximately 0.6800, marking a 0.5% increase from the previous session, as traders reacted positively to the improved economic outlook in Australia.

The upward movement in the AUD is a reflection of resilience in the Australian economy, attracting investors amid a backdrop of uncertainty in global markets. Analysts note that if the AUD surpasses the key resistance level of 0.6850, it could pave the way for further gains, with implications for trading strategies as market participants adjust their positions in response to evolving economic indicators.

The USD/CAD currency pair is currently experiencing downward pressure as it hovers near a three-month low of approximately 1.3750 during the late Asian trading session on Monday. Traders are closely analyzing the Federal Reserve's outlook for 2026, which is influencing market sentiment and prompting cautious trading strategies.

As the exchange rate remains vulnerable below the critical 1.3750 level, market participants are weighing the implications of potential shifts in U.S. monetary policy. This assessment could impact not only the USD but also the broader forex landscape, as traders position themselves ahead of forthcoming economic indicators and central bank communications.

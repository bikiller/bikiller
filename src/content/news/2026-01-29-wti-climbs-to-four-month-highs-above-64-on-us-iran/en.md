West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have surged to four-month highs, trading above $64.00 per barrel during early European trading on Thursday. This marks the third consecutive session of gains, driven primarily by escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The geopolitical climate has intensified, prompting traders to seek safe-haven assets, which could further bolster oil prices amid concerns over supply stability.

As oil prices climb, the implications for currency pairs involving the USD are notable. A stronger WTI could lead to a more robust USD, particularly against currencies like the EUR, as rising energy costs often influence inflation and monetary policy outlooks. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as continued volatility in oil markets may impact exchange rates and overall trading strategies in the forex market.

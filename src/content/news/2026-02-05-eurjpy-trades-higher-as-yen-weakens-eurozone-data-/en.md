EUR/JPY is trading at 185.40 on Thursday, marking a 0.10% gain for the day. The Japanese Yen remains under pressure, influenced by growing political uncertainty in Japan. This has led to weaker demand for the Yen, allowing the Euro to maintain a relatively stronger position, despite mixed macroeconomic signals from the Eurozone.

The Euro’s performance is more varied, with conflicting economic data adding volatility to the currency pair. While some indicators suggest resilience, others point to slower growth. With the European Central Bank's upcoming decision looming, market participants are keeping a close watch on any new developments that could sway the EUR/JPY exchange rate further.

The EUR/JPY currency pair is currently testing long-term highs around 182.60, as the Japanese Yen exhibits significant weakness against the G8 majors this week. Earlier on Wednesday, the pair demonstrated resilience, bouncing off a key support level near 182.00, where previous downside attempts were effectively contained.

As a result of this strong performance, EUR/JPY has reversed its earlier losses, rising to its highest exchange rate in over three decades. The continued weakness in the Yen has implications for traders, potentially signaling further movements in the Forex market as investors reassess their positions in light of ongoing market dynamics and economic factors affecting both the Euro and the Yen.

Silver (XAG/USD) is regaining ground, bouncing back to $75.00 after experiencing a significant decline of over 7% in value during Monday's trading session, characterized by low liquidity. This recovery comes amid rising geopolitical tensions that have influenced market sentiment, pushing investors toward safe-haven assets like silver.

As the currency pair navigates through this turbulent landscape, the exchange rate's volatility highlights the ongoing impact of global events on precious metals. Traders are closely monitoring the market, as further fluctuations could provide opportunities for those looking to capitalize on price movements in the silver market against the backdrop of the broader USD trends.

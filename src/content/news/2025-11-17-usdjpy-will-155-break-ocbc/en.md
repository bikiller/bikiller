The USD/JPY currency pair continues to hover near recent highs, last recorded at 154.75. The exchange rate is influenced by a mix of fiscal concerns and the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) delayed policy normalization. Market participants are closely monitoring these dynamics, which could have significant implications for future trading patterns.

Additionally, risk sentiment and potential intervention risks are playing a crucial role in the movement of USD/JPY. Analysts from OCBC, Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, suggest that these opposing forces will continue to shape the exchange rate's trajectory, raising questions about whether the critical level of 155 will eventually break. Traders should keep a close watch on these factors as they navigate the evolving forex landscape.

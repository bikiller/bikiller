GBP/USD pulled back from its weekly highs above 1.3700 as traders turned cautious ahead of the upcoming Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report. The Pound initially made gains against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, recovering from previous losses. However, the currency pair struggled to maintain momentum at 1.3700, and by mid-session, GBP/USD retreated to the 1.3680 zone.

The market's focus has shifted toward the NFP data, which is expected to provide further insights into the strength of the US labor market and potential monetary policy shifts from the Federal Reserve. As traders await the report, GBP/USD's price action remains capped around the 1.3700 level, and a continued pullback could see further support around 1.3650.

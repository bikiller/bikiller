The GBP/JPY currency pair held steady near weekly highs on Friday as the Japanese Yen continued to weaken following softer-than-expected Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation data. The disappointing figures pressured the JPY, encouraging fresh selling and lifting the Pound’s exchange rate. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY was trading around 212.16, reflecting firm demand in yen-cross trading.

Market participants interpreted the weaker Tokyo CPI as a signal that Japan’s inflation momentum may be easing, which in turn raised doubts over how quickly the Bank of Japan (BoJ) can proceed with policy normalisation. This uncertainty weighed on the Yen across major currency pairs, while the British Pound remained supported despite broader moves in USD and EUR markets.

With GBP/JPY hovering near key weekly technical levels, traders will closely watch upcoming BoJ commentary and global risk sentiment for direction. Continued yen softness could keep the pair elevated, while stronger inflation or shifting rate expectations may trigger a pullback in the exchange rate.

Silver prices surged nearly 4% on Monday, with the XAG/USD currency pair trading around $75.50 during European hours. This significant rise reflects a bullish sentiment among traders, supported by a technical analysis that indicates the precious metal remains within an ascending channel pattern. 

The persistence of this bullish bias suggests continued upward momentum for silver, which could attract further interest from investors seeking safe-haven assets amidst market fluctuations. As the exchange rate for XAG/USD approaches key resistance levels, market participants will be closely monitoring external factors that could influence future price movements.

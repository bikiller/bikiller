The South Korean won (KRW) is experiencing notable underperformance in the forex market, largely due to the recent announcement of increased tariffs by US President Trump. This move has raised concerns among investors, contributing to a decline in the KRW's exchange rate against major currencies, particularly the US dollar (USD). Despite the tariffs weighing heavily on the KRW, reduced capital outflows are providing a modicum of support, helping to stabilize the currency amid the volatility.

As the market reacts to these tariff threats, traders are closely monitoring the KRW/USD currency pair for any signs of further depreciation. The dynamics of the forex landscape are shifting, with the KRW trading under pressure, yet resilient to some extent due to domestic factors. The implications of these tariff changes could lead to increased trading activity as investors reassess their positions in anticipation of further developments in US trade policy.

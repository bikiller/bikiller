Gold (XAU/USD) gained traction on Monday, trading around $4,087, which reflects a nearly 0.50% increase after recovering from an intraday low of approximately $4,040. This uptick comes as investors react to a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, which has influenced expectations for a potential easing of monetary policy.

The AUD/USD currency pair has remained steady around the 0.6700 level for the second consecutive day, as holiday season trading has led to diminished market volumes. This lack of liquidity is stifling momentum, leaving the exchange rate unable to break free from this technical level.

As traders close out the year, the reduced activity is indicative of the broader trend in the forex market, where both the Australian dollar and the US dollar face challenges. With the holiday season in full swing, market participants may find it difficult to push the AUD/USD beyond its current range, potentially setting the stage for increased volatility once trading volumes return to normal in the new year.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) is under pressure ahead of the Bank of England's (BoE) policy decision, trading lower against its major counterparts. As of Thursday morning, GBP/USD is hovering around 1.2215, down 0.3% from the previous session. Traders are positioning for the BoE's interest rate decision at 12:00 GMT, with expectations of no immediate changes, but a cautious tone could drive further volatility.

The GBP is also weaker against the Euro, with EUR/GBP climbing to 0.8740. Market participants are focused on the central bank's stance on inflation, which could offer clues on future tightening. With recent economic data showing signs of resilience, the BoE's message could influence the pound's direction through the rest of the week, especially as the USD remains strong across the board.

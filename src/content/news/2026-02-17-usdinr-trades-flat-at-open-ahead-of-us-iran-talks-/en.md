The Indian Rupee (INR) remained steady against the US Dollar (USD) at the open on Tuesday, trading near Monday's low of 90.80. The currency pair USD/INR shows limited movement as traders await significant catalysts, including the ongoing US-Iran talks and the upcoming release of the FOMC minutes.

Market sentiment is cautious as investors brace for potential shifts in geopolitical dynamics and monetary policy insights. The INR's performance near the 90.80 level suggests a wait-and-see approach, with traders closely monitoring global developments that could impact exchange rate fluctuations. The release of the FOMC minutes could offer clues on the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate decisions, influencing both the USD and INR.

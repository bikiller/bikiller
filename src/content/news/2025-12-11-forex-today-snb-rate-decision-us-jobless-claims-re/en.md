The forex market is poised for significant movement today as traders focus on the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) rate decision and the latest US Jobless Claims report. The EUR/USD currency pair is closely watched, currently trading at 1.0600, with resistance at 1.0650. Market sentiment is mixed ahead of the SNB's announcement, with expectations of maintaining the current interest rate intact, which could impact the Swiss franc's exchange rate.

In the US, the Jobless Claims data is expected to reveal a slight increase in claims, potentially affecting the USD's strength. The current trading price for USD/JPY is 110.30, facing support around 110.00. Traders anticipate how these economic indicators will influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook, as any surprises could lead to increased volatility in the currency markets.

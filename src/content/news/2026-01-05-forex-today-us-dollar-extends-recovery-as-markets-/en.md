The US dollar continued its recovery on Monday, January 5, as traders reacted to recent geopolitical developments following a US strike on Venezuela. The USD rose against major currencies, with the EUR/USD exchange rate dipping to 1.1050, reflecting a 0.3% decline. The market's focus on geopolitical tensions has created volatility, prompting investors to seek safe-haven assets like the greenback.

In contrast, the GBP/USD pair experienced a slight uptick, trading at 1.3500, up 0.2% as the UK’s economic data remains mixed. Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair showed resilience, climbing to 115.50, indicating a strong demand for the dollar amidst ongoing market uncertainty. As traders watch these developments closely, the implications for future trading strategies in currency pairs will be significant, particularly if tensions escalate further.

The USD/INR currency pair faces upside risks as outflows from India and concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) developments weigh on market sentiment. MUFG analysts Lin Li, Michael Wan, Lloyd Chan, and Khang Sek Lee highlight that India's fourth-quarter GDP growth is expected to slow, primarily due to weaker export performance. Despite this, resilient domestic demand is likely to mitigate some of the downside pressures on the economy.

The Indian rupee's exchange rate will likely remain under pressure, with any potential outflows adding to volatility. The ongoing concerns surrounding AI advancements could also influence the currency pair's movements, as investors monitor global tech trends. Traders should watch for key levels of support and resistance in USD/INR, as shifts in domestic economic performance and external factors continue to impact its trajectory.

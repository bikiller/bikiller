USD/JPY is currently trading in a narrow range just above the 156.00 level as the final week of 2025 draws to a close. Yen traders are confronting several challenges, with the Bank of Japan (BoJ) being a significant source of uncertainty. The central bank's policies and statements are influencing market sentiment, making it difficult for the currency pair to gain momentum.

The stagnation in the exchange rate reflects broader market dynamics, where the USD's strength is countered by the Yen's vulnerabilities. As traders navigate these headwinds, the focus remains on potential interventions from the BoJ and other economic indicators that might sway the USD/JPY pairing in the coming sessions.

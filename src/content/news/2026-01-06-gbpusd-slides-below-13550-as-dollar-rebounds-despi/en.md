The GBP/USD currency pair slipped below the 1.3550 mark as the US Dollar made a notable recovery, despite disappointing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data. After peaking at 1.3567 earlier in the session, the Pound Sterling faced downward pressure, trading at 1.3519, reflecting a decline of 0.15%. 

This movement comes amid neutral comments from Federal Reserve officials, suggesting a cautious outlook on monetary policy. The resilience of the USD, even in the face of soft economic indicators, highlights ongoing market dynamics that traders should watch closely. The current exchange rate signals potential volatility as the market digests the implications of both economic data and central bank communications.

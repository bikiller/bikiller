The Euro strengthened against the Japanese Yen for the second straight day, with the EUR/JPY currency pair trading above 185.10 during early European hours on Tuesday. This uptick follows a rebound from Monday's low of 182.69, driven by a notable sell-off in the Japanese currency amid broader market sentiments.

This movement highlights the ongoing volatility in forex trading, where the weaker Yen reflects concerns over Japan's economic outlook. As the exchange rate shifts, traders are closely monitoring any further developments that could impact the Euro's strength against the Yen, particularly in light of recent economic data from both regions. The current trading dynamics suggest potential for continued fluctuations in this currency pair as market participants adjust their positions.

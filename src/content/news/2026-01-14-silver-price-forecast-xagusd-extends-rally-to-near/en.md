Silver (XAG/USD) continues its upward momentum, extending its rally for the fourth consecutive day. During the Asian trading session, the currency pair approached the significant level of $90.00. This increase is driven by a robust demand for safe-haven assets as geopolitical tensions escalate, prompting investors to seek stability amidst uncertainty in global markets.

The ongoing geopolitical woes have reinforced the appeal of silver, pushing its exchange rate higher. As traders remain cautious, the demand for precious metals like silver tends to rise, reflecting a broader trend in the market. With the current trajectory, market participants will be closely monitoring the geopolitical landscape and its potential impact on the XAG/USD price, which could face further fluctuations depending on developments.

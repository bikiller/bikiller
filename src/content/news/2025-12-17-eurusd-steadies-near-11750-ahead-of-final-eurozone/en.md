The EUR/USD currency pair is holding steady around the 1.1750 mark during the Asian session on Wednesday, showing resilience after a significant retracement from a recent peak. This level comes after the pair reached its highest point since September 24, indicating that traders are cautiously reassessing their positions ahead of the forthcoming Eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.

As the USD recovery appears to be fading, market participants are keenly focused on the implications of the Eurozone inflation figures. A robust CPI reading could bolster the euro further, potentially pushing the exchange rate above current resistance levels. In contrast, any weakness in the data may lead to renewed selling pressure on the EUR/USD pair, as traders consider the broader economic landscape and its impact on future monetary policy.

EUR/USD has seen a slight rebound, trading at 1.1695 as it recovers from recent lows around 1.1670. This movement comes ahead of crucial economic data releases in the United States, specifically the GDP and PCE inflation figures, which are anticipated to influence the currency pair's trajectory in the near term.

The modest gains in the EUR/USD exchange rate suggest cautious optimism among traders as they await these indicators. A strong performance from the US economy could strengthen the USD, potentially impacting the exchange rate significantly. Conversely, weak data may support the euro in its quest for stability against the dollar.

The Indian Rupee (INR) showed resilience against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR pair holding steady near 90.55. The exchange rate’s slight decline comes amid renewed investor caution following the confirmation of a US-India trade deal, which triggered a return of Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) into Indian markets.

Market participants are watching closely as the INR demonstrates strength, suggesting potential support around the 90.50 level. The recent trading movement is likely influenced by market expectations for the trade deal's long-term impact on India's economic growth. The currency pair’s outlook remains tied to developments in global trade dynamics, particularly between the US and India.

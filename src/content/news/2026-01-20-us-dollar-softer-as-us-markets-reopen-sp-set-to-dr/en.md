The US dollar is experiencing a slight downturn as markets reopen following a public holiday, with notable movement across various currency pairs. The USD/JPY remains an exception, resisting the overall weakness in the dollar's performance. Traders are particularly focused on the exchange rate dynamics, as the dollar shows a softer stance against major currencies like the EUR and GBP.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is expected to open approximately 1.5% lower than its last close on Friday, signaling bearish sentiment among investors. The declining stock index may further influence currency trading, particularly as market participants assess the implications for economic indicators and future Federal Reserve policies. Overall, the combination of a weaker dollar and a declining equity market is shaping the trading landscape today.

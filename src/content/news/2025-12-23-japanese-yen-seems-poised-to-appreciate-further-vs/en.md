The Japanese Yen (JPY) is showing signs of potential appreciation against the US Dollar (USD) as market participants react to the ongoing divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve. During the early European session on Tuesday, the USD/JPY currency pair eased from its daily peak, allowing the exchange rate to rebound approximately 20 pips from just below the critical 156.00 level.

As traders assess the implications of these divergent policies, the yen's resilience may continue to shape trading dynamics in the forex market. With the BoJ maintaining its accommodative stance while the Fed signals tighter monetary conditions, the USD/JPY pair remains under pressure, potentially paving the way for further yen appreciation in the coming sessions.

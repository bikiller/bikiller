EUR/USD remained steady at 1.1800 on Thursday, with little change in its exchange rate as investors reacted to the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy decision. The ECB held rates unchanged, providing stability to the euro, while market participants awaited further economic data from the US. The currency pair is maintaining a neutral stance, hovering near this technical level as it balances European and US economic influences.

Mixed US labor data added complexity to the market's outlook. While some indicators pointed to ongoing strength in the job market, others raised concerns over economic momentum. This divergence in data sent conflicting signals to traders, limiting the USD's ability to capitalize on any potential strength. As a result, EUR/USD remains confined within a narrow range, with investors looking for clearer trends to determine the next move.

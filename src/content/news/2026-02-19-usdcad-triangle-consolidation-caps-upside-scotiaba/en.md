The USD/CAD currency pair has shown slight upward movement, with the Canadian Dollar softening but holding above the 1.37 mark. As the pair continues to track broader USD fluctuations, technical consolidation within a triangle pattern is limiting further gains for the pair. Market focus remains on external dollar dynamics, keeping the exchange rate within a controlled range.

Scotiabank analysts suggest a modest rise in fair value, now pegged at 1.3625 for USD/CAD, indicating a less favorable environment for the Canadian Dollar. Despite the CAD's weakening, the pair is contained by the resistance level, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in broader market sentiment and external influences on the greenback.

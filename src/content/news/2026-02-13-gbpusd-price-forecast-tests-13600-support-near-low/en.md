GBP/USD remains under pressure for the fourth consecutive session, hovering near the 1.3600 support level during the European trading hours on Friday. The pair continues to trade within an ascending channel, with the 1.3600 mark aligning closely with the lower boundary of this pattern. This technical structure points to an ongoing bullish bias, suggesting potential for a bounce or further support at this level.

However, the currency pair's subdued performance reflects a broader caution in the market as the USD holds steady. Traders are keeping an eye on upcoming economic data that could influence the exchange rate, with market sentiment largely driven by US economic indicators. The 1.3600 level remains a crucial support zone, and any break below could signal a shift in momentum, potentially challenging the bullish trend.

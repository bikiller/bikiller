Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing cautious trading, slightly dipping to around $4,200 as market participants prepare for the Federal Reserve’s forthcoming interest rate decision. The currency pair has remained within a recent consolidation zone, reflecting a measured response to the anticipated monetary policy announcement. Earlier in the session, XAU/USD reached an intraday high of $4,218 before the downward shift.

The Fed's interest rate decision is creating a ripple effect in the markets, influencing investor sentiment and gold's exchange rate against the USD. As traders remain on the lookout for potential signals regarding future policy changes, the price action in gold could see increased volatility in the aftermath of the announcement.

Gold continues to trade near record territory as the XAU/USD exchange rate stabilizes just below the $5,100 all-time high. After a brief late pullback in the previous session, the metal attracted fresh buying interest, extending its positive bias for a seventh consecutive day. Persistent safe-haven demand and broad-based USD weakness remain central drivers of current trading conditions.

In the forex market, the softer US Dollar has provided ongoing support to gold prices, with major currency pairs reflecting cautious positioning ahead of the Federal Reserve. As traders reassess USD exposure across EUR/USD and other pairs, capital continues to rotate toward non-yielding assets. Elevated geopolitical and macro uncertainty has reinforced gold’s role as a hedge within diversified trading strategies.

From a technical perspective, holding above the psychological $5,000 level keeps the bullish structure intact, with the $5,100 zone acting as immediate resistance. A sustained break could open further upside, while any deeper correction would likely attract dip buyers. Market participants remain focused on Fed signals, as shifts in USD expectations could influence near-term gold momentum.

Gold (XAU/USD) fell below the $4,200 mark on Monday as rising yields and uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting weighed on the precious metal. Currently trading at $4,195, gold has dipped 0.27% after reaching a daily high of $4,219. Traders are positioning themselves ahead of the Fed's anticipated third consecutive rate cut, which is expected before the end of 2026.

The market's focus on the Fed's monetary policy is creating volatility in the gold market, as speculations about interest rate adjustments influence investor sentiment. With rising yields typically boosting the appeal of the U.S. dollar (USD) over non-yielding assets like gold, the current exchange rate dynamics reflect these pressures on bullion. As the central bank's decisions unfold, traders will closely monitor further movements in both gold and the broader currency markets.

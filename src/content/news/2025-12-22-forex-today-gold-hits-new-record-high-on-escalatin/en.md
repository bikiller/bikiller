Gold soared to a new record high of $2,075 per ounce on Monday, December 22, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions that have heightened demand for safe-haven assets. The ongoing unrest has led investors to seek stability in gold, pushing prices up by 2.5% over the past week. As a result, the USD is showing signs of weakness against a basket of currencies, particularly the EUR, which is currently trading at an exchange rate of 1.10.

In the forex market, the heightened uncertainty has seen the EUR/USD pair gaining traction, reflecting a broader shift in investor sentiment. Traders are closely monitoring developments, with key technical levels indicating that a breakout above 1.11 could signal further bullish momentum for the euro. Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair remains under pressure, trading near 130.5 as risk aversion continues to dominate market sentiment.

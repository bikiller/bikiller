EUR/USD is trading higher on Thursday, holding steady near four-year highs as the currency pair rebounds from the prior session’s dip. After sliding to lows just below 1.1900 on Wednesday, the exchange rate has recovered and is back around 1.1970 at the time of writing, reflecting resilient demand for the EUR despite shifting rate expectations.

The move comes even as the USD finds support from a hawkish Federal Reserve backdrop, which typically boosts the greenback in FX trading. Still, the euro is maintaining its footing, suggesting investors remain confident in the broader uptrend and are willing to buy dips near the 1.1900 technical area.

With price action hovering near 1.1970, traders will be watching whether EUR/USD can sustain momentum toward the psychological 1.2000 level. A firm break above that zone could reinforce bullish positioning, while another failure may keep the currency pair range-bound in the near term as markets reassess Fed signals and USD direction.

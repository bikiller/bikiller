EUR/USD continues its downward trajectory, marking a fourth consecutive day of losses. As of the latest trading session, the currency pair is priced at 1.1715, reflecting a slight decline as it approaches the end of the week. This follows a robust rally of nearly 2% over the preceding three weeks, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment.

The US Dollar has gained traction in this period of calm trading, contributing to the downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate. Investors appear to be reassessing their positions after a recent surge in the pair, leading to a cautious outlook for the Euro as it struggles to maintain its strength against the USD. The market's reaction suggests that traders are keeping a close eye on economic indicators that could influence future movements.

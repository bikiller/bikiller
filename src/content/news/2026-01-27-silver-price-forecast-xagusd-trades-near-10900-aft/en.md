Silver prices (XAG/USD) are experiencing a positive shift, currently trading around $108.90 after recovering from earlier losses. This marks the continuation of a four-day winning streak as the safe-haven asset gains traction amid escalating political and trade tensions. Investors are increasingly turning to silver as a protective measure amidst uncertainty in the financial markets.

The upward momentum in the currency pair reflects a broader shift in trader sentiment, with concerns over geopolitical risks prompting buying interest in precious metals. As XAG/USD hovers near the key psychological level of 109.00, market participants will be closely monitoring any developments that could further impact the exchange rate and influence trading decisions in the days ahead.

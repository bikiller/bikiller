West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading at approximately $56.30 early Thursday, reflecting a decline as the US Dollar strengthens. The current exchange rate dynamics are favoring the USD, impacting commodities priced in the currency. This shift in market sentiment highlights the ongoing influence of the greenback on oil prices, particularly amidst fluctuating economic indicators.

Compounding the downward pressure on WTI is the sign of weak energy demand from China, a key player in global oil consumption. As traders assess these developments, the implications for supply and demand dynamics remain significant. The interplay between the USD's strength and China's energy appetite will likely continue to shape market trends in the near term, influencing trading strategies across the board.

EUR/USD is trading firmly near the 1.1630 mark, having recently rebounded from seven-week lows of 1.1585 earlier on Monday. The currency pair's resilience comes amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, which have contributed to fluctuations in the exchange rate as investors navigate the uncertain landscape.

As market participants weigh the potential implications of these trade disputes, the euro's strength against the dollar reflects a cautious optimism. Traders are closely monitoring developments that could influence future movements in this key currency pair, with resistance levels becoming increasingly significant in the current trading environment.

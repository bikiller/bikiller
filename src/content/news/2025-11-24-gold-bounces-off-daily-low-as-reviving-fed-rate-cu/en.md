Gold (XAU/USD) showed signs of recovery after hitting a daily low during the early European session, trading just above the $4,060 mark. The precious metal is currently experiencing a mild negative bias, down less than 0.15% for the day. The rebound comes as market sentiment shifts, fueled by renewed bets on potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which are weighing on the strength of the USD.

As traders adjust their positions, the implications for the broader forex market are significant. The weakening of the USD amid expectations of lower interest rates could lead to fluctuations in the exchange rates of major currency pairs like EUR/USD. Investors remain cautious, closely monitoring economic indicators to assess the likelihood of further monetary easing by the Fed, which could impact gold prices and overall market dynamics.

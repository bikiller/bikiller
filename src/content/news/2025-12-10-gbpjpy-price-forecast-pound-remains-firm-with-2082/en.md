The GBP/JPY currency pair is showing resilience this week, buoyed by a broader weakness in the Japanese Yen. Trading near multi-year highs around 208.90, the Pound is effectively holding its ground against the Yen, with attempts to push lower being capped above the critical support level at 208.20. 

The strength of the Pound reflects positive market sentiment, likely influenced by recent developments in the UK economy. As traders remain cautious, the stability in this exchange rate could signal continued bullish momentum for the Pound, especially if the Yen's weakness persists amidst global economic uncertainties.

Gold (XAU/USD) remains stable above the $4,200 mark as traders anticipate the Federal Reserve's rate decision scheduled for Wednesday. Currently, the precious metal is displaying modest intraday gains but lacks strong bullish momentum, fluctuating within a narrow trading range that has persisted for the past week. The market's focus on upcoming monetary policy shifts highlights the significance of interest rates on gold’s appeal as a safe haven.

As the EUR/USD exchange rate holds steady, investor sentiment is influenced by the Fed's potential moves, which could reshape capital flows in the forex market. The stability in gold prices signifies a cautious approach among investors, who are weighing the implications of the Fed's decision on the USD and broader market dynamics. Investors are poised for a potential breakout, with eyes on critical data impacting future trading in gold and other currencies.

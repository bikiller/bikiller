Gold prices have recently rebounded above $4,900/oz, recovering from declines driven by a stronger USD and risk-off market sentiment. The precious metal had been under pressure as the USD strengthened against major currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, amid concerns about global economic stability. The recent price drop was amplified by thin Asian trading liquidity, which exaggerated market moves.

Despite this short-term setback, ING's commodities team views the pullback as a corrective phase rather than a trend reversal. With the broader outlook remaining constructive, analysts expect gold to maintain upward momentum, supported by potential weakness in the USD and market uncertainty. Traders are advised to consider this dip as a potential buying opportunity.

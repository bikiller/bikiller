The GBP/USD currency pair is trading on a softer note around 1.3605 early on Monday, as market sentiment turns cautious. Growing expectations of a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) have put downward pressure on the British pound. The exchange rate is facing challenges as traders anticipate the central bank’s dovish stance to weigh on the Pound Sterling against the US Dollar.

Despite the current pullback, the GBP/USD remains supported above the key technical level of 1.3600, suggesting a medium-term bullish bias. Should the pair maintain trading above this level, it could signal further upside potential. However, any developments related to the BoE’s policy stance and broader market sentiment will likely play a significant role in guiding the currency pair’s direction in the coming sessions.

The GBP/JPY currency pair extended its decline on Wednesday, sliding to its lowest level since December 19 as firm demand for the Japanese Yen weighed heavily on the exchange rate. The cross dropped toward 209.25 during European trading, marking its third consecutive daily loss and highlighting persistent selling pressure on the British Pound across the broader forex market.

Broad-based strength in the Yen has underpinned the move, with investors favoring the Japanese currency amid shifting risk sentiment and positioning flows. As the Yen strengthens not only against GBP but also versus peers such as USD and EUR, GBP/JPY has come under sustained pressure, reflecting cautious trading conditions and defensive capital allocation.

The break to an eight-week low reinforces the near-term bearish tone surrounding the pair, with traders closely monitoring momentum and liquidity dynamics. Continued Yen demand could keep the exchange rate under pressure, while any stabilization in global risk appetite or renewed Pound support may be needed to curb further downside in this closely watched cross-currency pair.

The recent geopolitical turmoil stemming from Venezuela has seen its influence on the foreign exchange markets diminish, with traders shifting their focus back to economic data. The USD is regaining strength as the market stabilizes, with key currency pairs like EUR/USD trading around 1.0700. This return to pre-January levels reflects a broader sense of calm among investors, who are prioritizing fundamental indicators over fleeting headlines.

As oil prices and equity markets stabilize, the USD/EUR exchange rate is expected to find a technical support level around 1.0650. Analysts predict that upcoming economic reports will further dictate trading patterns, particularly as the market looks for signs of recovery in the U.S. economy. With the geopolitical noise quieting down, traders are likely to take cues from data releases, steering exchange rates in the coming sessions.

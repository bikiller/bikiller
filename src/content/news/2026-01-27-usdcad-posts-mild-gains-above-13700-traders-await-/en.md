The USD/CAD currency pair is trading with modest gains, hovering around 1.3720 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This movement comes as traders await key rate decisions from both the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the Bank of Canada (BoC) later this week. Market sentiment remains cautious as these central banks are expected to influence the broader market direction.

The pair has managed to hold above the 1.3700 level, a critical technical support, amid expectations that both the USD and CAD will be affected by the upcoming monetary policy announcements. The Fed's stance on inflation and the BoC's economic outlook will likely shape the trading sentiment for USD/CAD in the near term, with the potential for more volatility around these events.

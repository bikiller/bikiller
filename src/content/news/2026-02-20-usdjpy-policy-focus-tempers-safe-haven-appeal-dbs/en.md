The USD/JPY has surged past 155, driven by broad Dollar strength, despite ongoing geopolitical uncertainties that typically bolster the Japanese Yen as a safe haven. This upward movement in the exchange rate comes amid strong U.S. economic data, which continues to support the Dollar’s dominance in the forex market.

Key developments surrounding Japan’s fiscal policy are likely to influence JPY’s direction moving forward. Notably, the ongoing debate over Japan’s FY26 budget and Prime Minister Takaichi's proposal to suspend the consumption tax on food are important factors that traders are monitoring closely. These political decisions could have significant implications for the Yen's stability and future performance.

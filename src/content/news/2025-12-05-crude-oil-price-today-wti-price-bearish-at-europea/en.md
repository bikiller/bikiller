West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices registered a decline during the early European session on Friday, trading at $59.36 per barrel, a slight drop from Thursday’s close of $59.48. This bearish momentum in WTI reflects broader market concerns, influenced by fluctuating demand projections and geopolitical tensions that continue to overshadow oil market stability.

Meanwhile, Brent crude also experienced a downturn, with prices falling to $63.08 from the previous daily closing rate of $63.16. As oil prices dip, traders should closely monitor the correlation between crude movements and currency pairs, particularly the USD/EUR exchange rate, as shifts in oil prices can significantly impact economic conditions and trading strategies in the forex market.

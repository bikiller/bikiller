The Euro (EUR) continues its downward trend against the US Dollar (USD) for a fourth straight day, with the EUR/USD pair trading at 1.1855. This marks a drop from its weekly high of 1.1928, reflecting ongoing pressure ahead of crucial economic data releases. Market participants are awaiting Eurozone GDP figures and the US Consumer Price Index (CPI), both of which could provide fresh direction for the currency pair.

The decline in the EUR/USD exchange rate comes as traders brace for potential volatility. The Euro’s weakness may stem from concerns over economic growth in the Eurozone, while the USD remains supported by expectations of stronger inflation data from the US. The upcoming data releases are expected to influence market sentiment, with any surprises likely to impact the Euro's trajectory against the Dollar in the near term.

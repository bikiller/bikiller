The Euro (EUR) maintained its strength against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, with the EUR/USD currency pair trading near two-week highs. The exchange rate saw a firm hold as traders reacted to the latest mixed signals from the ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), indicating a complex economic landscape for the US.

As the market digests this data, the Dollar remains on the defensive, struggling to gain momentum. The fluctuations in PMI figures have created uncertainty among investors, prompting them to reassess their positions in this key currency pair. Continued volatility in the USD could lead to further adjustments in trading strategies as market participants seek clarity on economic trends.

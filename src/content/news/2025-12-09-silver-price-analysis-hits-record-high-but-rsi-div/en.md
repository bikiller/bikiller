Silver (XAG/USD) continued its upward momentum on Tuesday, reaching a new record high of $60.75 after gaining over 4% during the day. The precious metal has surged an impressive 110% year to date, reflecting strong demand and favorable market conditions. Currently, XAG/USD is trading at $60.65, slightly below its peak.

Despite this bullish trend, analysts are advising caution as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates a divergence that could signal an overbought condition. Traders should remain vigilant as the market navigates these highs, considering potential corrections that may arise from profit-taking or shifts in investor sentiment. The current exchange rate underscores silver's robust performance against the USD in an increasingly volatile forex landscape.

The AUD/JPY currency pair reached new record highs, surpassing the 110.00 level during Wednesday’s European trading session. This marks the third consecutive day of gains, as the pair continues its upward momentum. The exchange rate has seen a strong rally, fueled by market sentiment and favorable conditions for the Australian dollar, which is benefiting from robust economic data.

This surge above 110.00 signals a shift in market dynamics, with investors increasingly confident in the AUD’s outlook. The rise in the currency pair highlights the ongoing strength of the Australian dollar against the Japanese yen, which remains under pressure due to weak economic data from Japan. The continued bullish trend suggests further upside potential, with eyes on potential resistance levels as the pair breaks new ground.

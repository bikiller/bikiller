The GBP/USD currency pair pulled back on Wednesday after reaching four-year highs of 1.3869 in the previous session, as the US Dollar rebounded across the FX market. The exchange rate slipped below the 1.3800 psychological level, with sterling last trading around 1.3798, down 0.32% on the day, reflecting cautious positioning ahead of key US events.

The modest reversal in trading was driven largely by renewed demand for the USD as investors focused on the upcoming Federal Reserve monetary policy decision. Expectations around interest rates and future guidance supported the Dollar, pressuring major currency pairs, including GBP/USD and EUR/USD. The pullback suggests near-term profit-taking after sterling’s strong multi-month rally.

From a market perspective, the inability to sustain gains above 1.3800 may signal a period of consolidation for the pair. Traders are closely watching whether the Fed delivers a hawkish or dovish message, which could influence broader USD flows. A stronger Dollar could extend the correction, while softer guidance may reopen the path toward recent highs.

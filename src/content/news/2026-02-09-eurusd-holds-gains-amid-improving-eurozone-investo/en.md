The EUR/USD currency pair is trading higher at the start of the week, maintaining its upward momentum above the 1.1860 mark. At the time of writing on Monday, the exchange rate reflects strong demand for the Euro, driven by improving investor sentiment within the Eurozone. The market appears to be responding positively to recent economic indicators, strengthening the Euro against the US Dollar.

The positive outlook for the Eurozone has allowed the Euro to hold its ground, with investors becoming increasingly optimistic about economic recovery prospects. As the EUR/USD pair moves past key technical levels, including 1.1860, traders are keeping an eye on further developments, with potential for additional gains in the near term.

USD/JPY is showing renewed upward momentum, according to Societe Generale. The currency pair has experienced a strong V-shaped recovery, moving higher as it pushes toward key resistance levels. The exchange rate is testing the 50-day moving average (50-DMA), a crucial level that could determine the next directional move.

The rebound signals a potential continuation of bullish momentum, especially if the pair can hold above critical support levels. Traders are eyeing the 50-DMA as a key technical indicator, with a break above this point likely to trigger further gains. This movement reflects broader market trends and investor sentiment towards the USD, which continues to outperform the JPY.

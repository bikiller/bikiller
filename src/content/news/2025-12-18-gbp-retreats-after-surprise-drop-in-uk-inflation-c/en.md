The Pound Sterling (GBP) saw a reversal of its earlier gains following an unexpected decline in UK inflation, which came in below market forecasts. This shift has shifted trader focus to the Bank of England's (BoE) upcoming rate decision and the possibilities of further monetary easing in future meetings. As a result, the GBP/USD exchange rate is under pressure, affecting trading sentiment across major currency pairs.

Commerzbank's Head of FX and Commodity Research, Thu Lan Nguyen, highlighted that this inflation data raises concerns about the BoE's approach to interest rates. With the market anticipating a rate cut today, the implications for GBP against the USD and EUR could lead to increased volatility as investors reassess their positions in light of the new economic landscape.

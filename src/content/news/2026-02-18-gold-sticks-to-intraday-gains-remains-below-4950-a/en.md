Gold (XAU/USD) continued its intraday rally, reaching a fresh daily high as it prepared for the European session on Tuesday. The precious metal extended its gains despite lingering pressure from the U.S. dollar. However, it remains firmly below the $4,950 mark, with traders cautious ahead of the upcoming release of the FOMC Minutes. 

The price of gold is seeing steady movement, trading within a narrow range. The recent uptick reflects a modest recovery, but market sentiment remains subdued as the focus shifts to the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes. Any hints regarding future monetary policy could significantly influence the USD and impact the XAU/USD exchange rate in the coming days.

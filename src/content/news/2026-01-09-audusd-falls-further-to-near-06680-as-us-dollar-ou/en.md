The AUD/USD currency pair continued its downward trend on Friday, falling to approximately 0.6676 during the late European trading session. This marks the third consecutive day of losses for the Australian dollar as it struggles against a stronger US dollar. The ongoing weakness in the AUD can be attributed to rising investor confidence in the USD, which has been buoyed by expectations surrounding upcoming economic data.

Market participants are closely monitoring US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, set to be released later today, which could further impact the exchange rate. A robust jobs report may reinforce the dollar's strength, potentially pushing the AUD/USD pair even lower. As traders position themselves ahead of these critical indicators, volatility may increase, resulting in significant implications for both currencies in the short term.

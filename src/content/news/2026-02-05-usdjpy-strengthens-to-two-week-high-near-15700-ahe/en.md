The USD/JPY currency pair surged to a two-week high near 157.00 during the early Asian session on Friday, as the Japanese Yen continued to face selling pressure. The exchange rate pushed higher amid expectations of market uncertainty ahead of Japan's snap general election, scheduled for Sunday. Investors are cautious about potential political shifts, which could influence the Yen's performance against the US Dollar.

The strength of the USD is also contributing to the Yen's weakness, with the greenback maintaining a solid footing in global markets. The pair's advance toward the 157.00 level marks a significant technical move, signaling continued bullish momentum. With the election looming, traders will closely monitor any developments that could drive volatility in the currency pair.

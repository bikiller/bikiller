The USD/JPY currency pair is currently expected to trade within the range of 156.20 to 157.35, as the UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, observe a waning possibility of the USD reaching 158.00 in the longer term. This diminishing outlook could signal a consolidation phase for the dollar against the yen, reflecting market uncertainties.

As traders analyze this range, they might consider various economic indicators and geopolitical factors influencing the exchange rate. A sustained trading pattern within these levels could imply a strategic pivot for investors, prompting them to reassess their positions in the USD and explore opportunities in other currencies, such as the EUR, as market sentiment evolves.

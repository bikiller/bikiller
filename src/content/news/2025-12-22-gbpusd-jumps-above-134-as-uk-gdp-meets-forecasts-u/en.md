The GBP/USD currency pair surged above the 1.34 level during the North American trading session on Monday, climbing 0.59% after the UK’s GDP data came in line with forecasts. This growth reflects a stable economic outlook for the UK, which provided support for the British pound amid thin liquidity as traders prepare for the upcoming Christmas Eve holiday.

As the market activity was subdued, the US dollar traded with limited volatility, allowing the pound to strengthen against it. Investors are closely monitoring economic indicators as they navigate the holiday season, with the exchange rate fluctuations indicating potential shifts in sentiment. The current dynamics underscore a cautious optimism in the UK economy, influencing trading strategies in the forex market.

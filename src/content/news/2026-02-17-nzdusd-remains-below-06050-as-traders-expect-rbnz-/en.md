The NZD/USD exchange rate remains under pressure, trading near 0.6030 during Tuesday's Asian session. The New Zealand dollar continues to struggle below the 0.6050 level, as traders largely anticipate the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) will maintain interest rates unchanged in its upcoming decision. This cautious outlook reflects market expectations for a stable monetary policy stance from the central bank.

With the pair holding below the 0.6050 mark, market sentiment remains subdued. A lack of significant catalysts and the broader USD strength have kept the New Zealand dollar in check. Investors are awaiting further clues from global economic developments, while the outlook for the RBNZ’s policy remains a key factor for the NZD/USD's near-term direction.

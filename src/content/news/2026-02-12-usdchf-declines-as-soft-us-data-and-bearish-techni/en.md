The Swiss Franc gained ground against the US Dollar on Thursday, with USD/CHF trading at 0.7700, down 0.22%. The move followed a slightly disappointing US jobs report, which, while not as impactful as Wednesday's Nonfarm Payrolls data, still contributed to a lack of upward momentum for the Greenback. 

Despite the softer US data, USD/CHF struggled to recover, with bearish technical signals adding further pressure. The currency pair's performance highlights the ongoing challenges for the USD in gaining traction, as traders remain cautious amid mixed economic indicators and a less favorable outlook.

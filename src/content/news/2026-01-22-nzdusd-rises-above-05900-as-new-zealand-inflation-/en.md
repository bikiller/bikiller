The NZD/USD pair surged to 0.5910, reaching its highest level since September 17, 2025, during the early Asian session on Friday. This sharp rally follows New Zealand’s inflation data, which exceeded expectations, driving the New Zealand Dollar (NZD) higher against the US Dollar (USD). The inflationary pressures signaled potential tightening by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, further boosting the NZD’s appeal.

Traders are now closely watching the NZD/USD as it hovers above the 0.5900 level, marking a strong technical milestone. With the inflation data fueling optimism for New Zealand’s economy, market participants are likely to adjust their positions in anticipation of possible policy shifts. The movement of the pair reflects growing confidence in the NZD, while the USD remains under pressure from softer-than-expected U.S. economic data.

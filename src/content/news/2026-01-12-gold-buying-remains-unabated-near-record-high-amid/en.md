Gold (XAU/USD) continues to hold steady near its all-time high as geopolitical tensions and concerns about Federal Reserve policies drive demand. Currently trading close to the record peak, bulls are eyeing a breakthrough of the $4,600 mark, which could signal further appreciation in the metal's value. 

The persistent interest in gold reflects broader market anxieties, particularly regarding the stability of the USD and economic conditions in Europe. As investors weigh the implications of Fed moves on interest rates and the ongoing geopolitical landscape, gold remains a favored safe haven, indicating that trading strategies may increasingly lean towards this precious metal in the near term.

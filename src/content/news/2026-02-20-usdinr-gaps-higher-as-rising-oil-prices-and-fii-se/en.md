The USD/INR currency pair opened with a gap higher on Friday, continuing its upward movement after a holiday on Thursday. The Indian Rupee (INR) faced downward pressure, with rising oil prices and Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling playing key roles in the weakness. At the start of the trading session, the USD/INR was trading at 83.20, up from Thursday's close, reflecting the impact of external factors on the Indian currency.

Rising oil prices, which increase India's import costs, contributed to the Rupee’s decline, while FII outflows further dampened market sentiment. The ongoing pressure on INR pushed the exchange rate to approach key resistance levels, which traders are closely monitoring for potential breakouts or reversals. With oil prices remaining elevated, the outlook for the Rupee remains bearish, and the market is likely to watch any significant shifts in global risk sentiment for further moves in USD/INR.

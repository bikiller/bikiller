The GBP/USD currency pair has shown resilience, strengthening to approximately 1.3090 during the early European session on Friday. However, the momentum for further gains appears constrained as traders brace for a potential interest rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE) at its upcoming monetary policy meeting in December. This market sentiment is likely to weigh heavily on the exchange rate in the near term.

Despite holding above the key psychological level of 1.3100, the pair continues to exhibit bearish momentum below the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). As expectations grow around the BoE's policy decisions, market participants are closely monitoring these developments, which could significantly influence GBP/USD trading dynamics in the coming weeks.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading at approximately $59.45 during the Asian session on Friday, remaining below the critical $60.00 mark. The decline in WTI prices is primarily driven by a rise in US crude oil inventories, which indicates an oversupply in the market. This added pressure comes as traders assess the implications of increasing stockpiles on future pricing.

Despite the drop in oil prices, expectations surrounding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts are providing some support to the market, cushioning losses for WTI. As traders evaluate the interplay between crude supply dynamics and monetary policy, the fluctuations in exchange rates for USD and EUR could further influence trading strategies in the energy sector. The market remains cautious as participants navigate these developments.

The US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the USD against six key currencies, has paused its five-day rally, currently trading near 100.20 during the Asian session on Monday. This stabilization comes as market participants anticipate the release of the US September Producer Price Index (PPI) report on Tuesday, which could influence future monetary policy decisions.

As bets for a December rate cut by the Federal Reserve increase, the DXY's movement reflects a cautious trading environment. Currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY may experience volatility in response to upcoming economic data, impacting exchange rates across the board. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as shifts in the USD's value could signal broader market trends.

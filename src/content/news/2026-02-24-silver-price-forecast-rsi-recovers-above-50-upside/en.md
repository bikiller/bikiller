Silver (XAG/USD) has regained momentum on Tuesday, recovering from earlier intraday weakness. The precious metal's price is being supported by ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties, which continue to attract dip buyers. As a result, the currency pair shows an upside bias, with market participants focused on any potential risk-off sentiment.

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) for silver has bounced back above the key 50 level, indicating a shift toward bullish sentiment. This technical recovery suggests further upside potential, especially if silver can maintain its price above this threshold. Traders will be monitoring global events closely, as any escalation in risks could drive additional demand for safe-haven assets like silver.

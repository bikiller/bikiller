Gold (XAU/USD) has reached fresh highs, trading around $4,413, reflecting a 1.70% increase on the day. This surge comes as rising geopolitical tensions drive investors toward safe-haven assets. The precious metal has successfully broken above the previous peak of $4,381 recorded on October 21, signaling strong bullish momentum in the market.

The escalating risks in global politics have heightened demand for gold, further supported by expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. As traders react to these developments, the exchange rate for gold against the USD is likely to remain volatile, with potential implications for other currency pairs, including EUR/USD, as market participants reassess their strategies in light of shifting economic indicators.

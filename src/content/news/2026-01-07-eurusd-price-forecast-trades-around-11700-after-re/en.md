EUR/USD is experiencing a rebound after three consecutive days of losses, trading around the 1.1700 mark during the Asian session on Wednesday. This recovery comes amid a broader market context where the euro has shown resilience against the USD, despite a prevailing bearish sentiment indicated by technical analysis.

On the daily chart, the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 47, reflecting neutral momentum and suggesting that the currency pair may face further challenges ahead. Traders will be closely monitoring this level, as it highlights potential fluctuations in the exchange rate, with the possibility of renewed selling pressure if bearish trends persist.

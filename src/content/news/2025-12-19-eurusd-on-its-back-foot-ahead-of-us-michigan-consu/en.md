EUR/USD is trading under pressure, currently hovering around 1.1710 as the US session opens. This marks a notable decline from the three-month highs above 1.1800 reached earlier this week. The recent drop reflects a strengthening US Dollar against its major counterparts, contributing to the pair's moderate losses as the week approaches its close.

Market participants are closely watching the upcoming US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, which could further influence the exchange rate. The current bearish momentum in EUR/USD underscores the dollar's resilience, raising concerns for Euro bulls as they navigate potential volatility ahead of key economic data releases.

The EUR/USD pair continues its downward trend for the third straight day, trading near 1.1860 during the early European session on Thursday. This weakness follows stronger-than-expected US jobs data, which reduced market expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut. As a result, the USD has gained strength against the euro, maintaining a firm hold over the currency pair.

Market participants are now eyeing the upcoming US weekly Initial Jobless Claims data, which could provide further insights into the labor market's health. On Friday, focus will shift to the highly anticipated US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which could influence future Fed decisions and impact the EUR/USD exchange rate.

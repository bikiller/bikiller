USD/CAD reversed a two-day losing streak and traded around 1.3560 during Tuesday’s Asian session, stabilizing after recent declines. The currency pair found support as the Canadian Dollar benefitted from a boost in foreign inflows, which helped counterbalance broader market pressures. The exchange rate held steady near the 1.3550 level, indicating resilience in the face of fluctuating global risk sentiment.

The Canadian Dollar's strength was largely attributed to sustained foreign investment flows into Canada, which provided positive momentum. As a result, the USD/CAD pair managed to hold its ground despite ongoing volatility in global markets. With the 1.3550 level acting as a key support zone, traders will be watching for any shifts in investor sentiment that could drive the currency pair higher or lower in the coming days.

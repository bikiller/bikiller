Gold (XAU/USD) maintained a steady position above $4,200 during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, reaching a new weekly high. Despite this upward movement, the precious metal experienced a lack of follow-through buying, indicating a cautious sentiment among traders as they await the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate decision.

As investors keep a close eye on forthcoming economic indicators, the exchange rate dynamics of gold remain influenced by the broader market perceptions of USD strength. With the FOMC meeting approaching, volatility in trading could increase, prompting market players to reassess their positions in light of potential changes to interest rates that could impact the USD and overall market sentiment.

This softening comes despite robust Australian PMI data that typically supports the Australian dollar. The pair struggles to build on the rebound observed on Thursday, reflecting mixed global sentiment that is influencing trading dynamics.

As the market anticipates upcoming US data releases, traders are cautiously evaluating the exchange rate movements. The current pressure on AUD/USD highlights the challenges faced by the Australian dollar despite favorable domestic indicators.

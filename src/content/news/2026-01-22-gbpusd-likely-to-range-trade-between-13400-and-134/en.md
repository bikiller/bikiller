The GBP/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a range of 1.3400 to 1.3460 in the near term, according to analysts at UOB Group. While the bias has a slight upward tilt, any potential breakout above the key resistance level of 1.3505 seems unlikely at this stage. 

This trading range indicates a consolidation phase for the Pound Sterling as it navigates through various economic indicators and market sentiment. Traders will be closely monitoring any developments that could influence the exchange rate, particularly in relation to the performance of the USD and broader market trends.

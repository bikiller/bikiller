The Pound Sterling (GBP) saw a strong rally across its major currency pairs following stronger-than-expected UK economic data. The flash S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for January surpassed forecasts, signaling continued economic expansion. Retail Sales also bounced back in December, growing 1.0% month-on-month after a dip in November. These developments have fueled optimism about the UK’s economic recovery, pushing GBP/USD to 1.2400, its highest level in over two weeks.

The upbeat data has bolstered the GBP, strengthening its appeal against both the USD and EUR. The EUR/GBP exchange rate saw a notable decline, dipping to 0.8760, reflecting the Pound’s strength. Analysts suggest the recent economic momentum could further support the GBP in the near term, though global market volatility and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates remain key risks for the currency. Traders are watching closely for any potential shifts in UK economic performance and central bank policies.

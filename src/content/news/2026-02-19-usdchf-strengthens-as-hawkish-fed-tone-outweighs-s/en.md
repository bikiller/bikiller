The Swiss Franc (CHF) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/CHF exchange rate rising to around 0.7750. The pair recovered from an intraday low of 0.7694, as a hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve provided support to the Greenback. Market participants are closely monitoring the Fed's stance on future rate hikes, fueling bullish sentiment for the USD.

In contrast, Swiss data failed to deliver any substantial boost to the CHF, allowing the USD to maintain its strength. As a result, the USD/CHF currency pair is seeing upward pressure, with traders focusing on potential shifts in US monetary policy. The ongoing strength of the dollar reflects investor confidence in the US economic outlook, overshadowing weaker Swiss fundamentals.

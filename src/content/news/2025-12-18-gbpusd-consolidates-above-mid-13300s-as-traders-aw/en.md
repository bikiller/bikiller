The GBP/USD currency pair is currently stabilizing above the mid-1.3300s, following a rebound from a one-week low of 1.3310. Traders are keenly observing market movements as they await the Bank of England's (BoE) policy decisions and the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which could significantly influence the exchange rate.

During the Asian session on Thursday, the trading range for GBP/USD remained narrow, reflecting uncertainty among traders. As the market prepares for these pivotal economic indicators, fluctuations in the exchange rate could intensify, impacting both the British pound and the US dollar in the near term.

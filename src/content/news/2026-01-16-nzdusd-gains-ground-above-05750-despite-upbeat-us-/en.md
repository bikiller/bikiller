The NZD/USD currency pair found support near 0.5755 during the early European session on Friday, reflecting a modest uptick amidst mixed market sentiment. The pair's ascent comes despite the release of positive economic data from the United States, which has tempered market expectations for imminent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed). 

As traders digest the upbeat US economic indicators, the potential for further gains in the NZD/USD exchange rate appears constrained in the near term. The lingering strength of the USD, bolstered by solid economic performance, suggests that upward momentum for the New Zealand dollar may face challenges as the market adjusts its outlook on Fed monetary policy.

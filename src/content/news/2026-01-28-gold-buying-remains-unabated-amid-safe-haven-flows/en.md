Gold (XAU/USD) continues its impressive ascent, reaching new all-time highs for the eighth consecutive day. As safe-haven demand remains strong, the precious metal is inching closer to the significant $5,300 mark during early European trading. This persistent rally reflects investors' growing apprehension about economic uncertainty, prompting them to seek refuge in gold.

Market analysts suggest that the ongoing demand for gold is likely fueled by speculation surrounding upcoming Federal Reserve decisions, with traders keenly monitoring exchange rate fluctuations between the USD and other currencies. As gold approaches this psychological threshold, its performance may influence broader market sentiment, potentially impacting trading strategies in the forex arena, particularly for those involved with the EUR/USD pair and other major currencies.

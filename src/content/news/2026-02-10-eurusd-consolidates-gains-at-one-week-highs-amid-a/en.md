The EUR/USD currency pair is holding steady at 1.1917, maintaining its position at one-week highs following a two-day rally. The Euro's strength against the US Dollar comes as the USD continues to weaken, with the exchange rate hovering just below recent resistance levels. Traders are closely watching these developments as the pair consolidates its recent gains.

The weaker US Dollar has been the key driver behind the Euro's advance, with sentiment shifting in favor of the Eurozone currency. Despite the lack of significant news from the European Central Bank or major economic data releases, the pair’s upward momentum suggests market participants are positioning for further EUR strength in the near term. The 1.1900 level remains a crucial support zone for the EUR/USD.

The EUR/USD currency pair surged to fresh highs as political tensions and trade disputes weighed on the US Dollar. The Euro reversed its earlier losses, climbing toward the September 2025 highs around 1.1920. At the time of writing, the 1.1920 level remains under pressure, highlighting strong bullish momentum in the market.

The ongoing trade rifts and rising geopolitical uncertainties have caused the USD to lose ground, boosting demand for the Euro. With the EUR/USD testing key resistance levels, traders are closely monitoring whether the pair can maintain its upward trajectory or if the Dollar will recover in response to shifting market sentiment.

Silver prices have dipped to approximately $80.15 during Asian trading on Wednesday, as traders take profits ahead of significant US economic data releases. The XAG/USD currency pair is under pressure as market participants position themselves ahead of the ISM Services Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) report, set to be unveiled later today.

The decline in silver comes amid cautious trading, with investors closely monitoring the potential impact of the upcoming economic indicators on the USD exchange rate. As traders react to profit-taking, the fluctuations in the white metal's price highlight the ongoing volatility in the forex market, driven by sentiment surrounding US economic health and its implications for future monetary policy decisions.

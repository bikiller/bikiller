NZD/USD has pulled back to around 0.6050 after reaching six-month highs, marking a halt to its bullish run that began on January 16. The currency pair's momentum weakened following the release of the ANZ – Roy Morgan Consumer Confidence index, which climbed to 107.2 in January from 101.5 in December, its highest level since August 2021.

Despite the upbeat consumer sentiment, the New Zealand dollar remains subdued as market participants digest the latest data. The NZD/USD exchange rate faces resistance at recent highs, and traders are cautious about further gains. The movement in the pair highlights ongoing concerns over global economic conditions and the broader market outlook for the USD.

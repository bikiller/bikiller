USD/CHF continues its downward trajectory, trading in negative territory for the third consecutive day. During the European session on Tuesday, the currency pair hovers around the exchange rate of 0.7910, reflecting a decline of 0.80% on the day. This sustained pullback highlights growing risk-off sentiment among investors, prompting them to seek safer assets amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The slide in USD/CHF can be attributed to the weight of tariffs and uncertainties in global trade, which have influenced market dynamics. As traders remain cautious, the USD faces pressure against the Swiss franc, traditionally viewed as a safe haven. The current trading environment suggests a potential for further volatility in this currency pair, especially if risk aversion persists in the broader financial markets.

The EUR/USD currency pair remains relatively stable, trading around the 1.1650 level during the Asian session on Wednesday. After a slight decline in the previous trading period, the exchange rate shows limited movement, reflecting cautious sentiment in the market. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dipped to 40, suggesting a weakening momentum but not yet indicating an oversold market.

Traders are closely monitoring the technical indicators as they assess potential shifts in the exchange rate. With the RSI positioned below the 50 midline, the current market environment suggests a lack of strong bullish or bearish signals. As the USD continues to influence market dynamics, the outlook for the EUR/USD pair remains uncertain, emphasizing the need for vigilance among forex traders.

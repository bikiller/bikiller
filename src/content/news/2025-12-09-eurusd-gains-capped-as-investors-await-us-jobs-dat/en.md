EUR/USD experienced slight gains on Tuesday, currently trading at 1.1650, after recovering from a low of 1.1616 observed on Monday. The modest uptick in the exchange rate reflects cautious trading as investors brace for critical U.S. jobs data and an impending Federal Reserve policy decision.

Market sentiment remains tentative, with traders closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. The upcoming jobs report may provide insights into the strength of the U.S. labor market, further affecting the USD’s performance against the EUR. As the currency pair stabilizes, expectations around monetary policy continue to shape market dynamics.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) continued their upward trend, reaching approximately $4,235 during the early Asian session on Thursday. This increase follows the US Federal Reserve's anticipated third consecutive interest rate cut, which has bolstered demand for the precious metal. The Fed's decision to maintain its forecast of only one rate cut in 2026 has further influenced investor sentiment in the market.

The latest developments in monetary policy have impacted the exchange rate dynamics for various currency pairs, with the USD showing signs of weakness against commodities like gold. As traders react to the Fed's stance, the implications for the forex market could include shifts in trading strategies, particularly for those involved in USD-related pairs, as market participants adjust their expectations for future interest rate movements.

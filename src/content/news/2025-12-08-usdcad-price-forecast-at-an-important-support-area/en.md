The USD/CAD currency pair is currently facing significant pressure, trading near a critical support level at 1.3820. Over the past two weeks, the US Dollar has experienced a notable decline, losing approximately 2% against the Canadian Dollar. This bearish trend highlights the challenges for the USD as attempts to rebound have proven limited.

Market sentiment remains cautious as traders navigate various economic indicators influencing the exchange rate. With the USD struggling against the CAD, the implications of this trend could lead to further volatility in trading, particularly if the support level at 1.3820 is breached. Investors will be closely monitoring developments that could impact the future direction of this currency pair.

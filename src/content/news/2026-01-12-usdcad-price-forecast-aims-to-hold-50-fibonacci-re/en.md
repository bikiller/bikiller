The USD/CAD currency pair experienced a decline after failing to extend its impressive nine-day winning streak on Monday. The exchange rate corrected towards the key technical level of 1.3890 as traders reacted to a retracement in the US Dollar (USD). This shift followed the unsettling news of criminal charges against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which weighed heavily on market sentiment.

As the Loonie regained some ground, the focus remains on whether the USD/CAD can maintain its position above the critical 50% Fibonacci retracement level at 1.3890. The evolving situation with the Fed adds uncertainty to the market, prompting traders to closely monitor developments that could influence the USD's stability in the coming days.

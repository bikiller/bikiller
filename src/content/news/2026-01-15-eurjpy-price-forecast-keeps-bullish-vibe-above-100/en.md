The EUR/JPY currency pair is showing signs of losing momentum, trading around the 184.50 level during the early European session on Thursday. This decline comes as the Japanese Yen gains strength against the Euro, influenced by heightened market caution over potential government intervention in the currency market amid impending elections in Japan.

Traders are closely monitoring the situation as the Japanese authorities have issued strong warnings regarding currency stability. The EUR/JPY remains above the critical 100-day EMA, which suggests a prevailing bullish sentiment, but the recent price action raises concerns about the sustainability of this upward trend as market participants weigh the implications of potential policy changes.

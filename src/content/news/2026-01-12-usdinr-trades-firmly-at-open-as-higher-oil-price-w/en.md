The Indian Rupee (INR) opened the week on a cautious note against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR currency pair trading firmly around 90.66, near its weekly high. The INR is facing downward pressure primarily due to escalating oil prices, which have significantly impacted the country's import costs and overall economic outlook.

Additionally, foreign fund outflows from the Indian equity market have further weakened the Rupee. As market participants monitor these developments, investors are likely to keep a close eye on the exchange rate movements, anticipating how they might influence trading strategies in the coming days.

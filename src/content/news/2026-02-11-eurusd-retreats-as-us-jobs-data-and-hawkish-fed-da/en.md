The EUR/USD currency pair fell below the 1.1900 mark on Wednesday as the US dollar gained strength following a robust jobs report. The data highlighted the resilience of the US economy, reinforcing expectations that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more hawkish stance, dampening market hopes for imminent rate cuts. At the time of writing, EUR/USD was trading at 1.1885, down 0.07%.

The strong jobs data has spurred a rebound in the USD, putting pressure on the euro and shifting the trading dynamic. With the Federal Reserve likely to maintain a tighter policy stance, the market sentiment surrounding EUR/USD has turned more cautious. As the pair hovers near the 1.1885 level, traders will be keen to monitor further US economic data for additional clues on the Fed's future actions.

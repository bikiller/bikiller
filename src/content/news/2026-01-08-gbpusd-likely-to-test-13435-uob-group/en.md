The GBP/USD currency pair is showing potential for upward movement, with analysts at UOB Group indicating a possible test of the 1.3435 level. This suggests a bullish sentiment in the market, as traders anticipate that the exchange rate could rise. The major support level at 1.3400 remains strong, which should help cushion any declines for the Pound Sterling against the US Dollar.

Market dynamics are influenced by various factors, including recent economic data and geopolitical developments. As traders monitor these variables, the resilience of the 1.3400 support level will be crucial. A successful test of 1.3435 could signal further gains for GBP/USD, while a failure to maintain above 1.3400 might prompt increased selling pressure in the market.

Gold prices surged for the fourth consecutive day, reclaiming the $5,200 mark during the North American session on Monday. The rally was driven by heightened demand for safe-haven assets amid growing trade uncertainty. The USD weakened following the US Supreme Court's ruling against the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) duties, fueling concerns over the direction of US trade policies. The move placed additional pressure on the greenback, triggering increased buying interest in gold.

The retreat of the USD caused notable shifts in currency pairs, with the EUR/USD gaining traction and advancing through key levels. As traders sought refuge in gold, the precious metal notched a fresh four-day rally, benefiting from geopolitical tensions and concerns around the global trade landscape. With markets still digesting the court ruling, analysts remain cautious about the potential for further volatility, which could continue to support demand for safe-haven assets like gold in the near term.

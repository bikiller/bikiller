The AUD/USD currency pair is trading around 0.7040 on Tuesday, slipping 0.20% on the day. After testing the key 0.7100 level on Monday, the pair failed to maintain its position above the psychological mark, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. The Australian dollar is now under pressure ahead of key data from Australia, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report.

Uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs is also weighing on the exchange rate, adding volatility to the forex market. Traders are closely watching these developments, as the potential for changes in U.S. trade policies could significantly influence the USD’s value in the short term. As the market anticipates the CPI release, the direction of AUD/USD remains uncertain, with the currency pair at a critical juncture.

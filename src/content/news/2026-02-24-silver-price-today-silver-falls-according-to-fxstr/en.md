Silver prices dropped on Tuesday, with XAG/USD trading at $88.04 per troy ounce, reflecting a 0.98% decline from the previous day's $88.91. The precious metal faced downward pressure amid market fluctuations, influenced by a stronger USD and shifting risk sentiment. Silver’s recent pullback highlights ongoing uncertainty in the broader commodity markets, with investors cautious of further volatility.

This decline comes as the USD gained strength across major currency pairs, impacting commodity prices. The silver market, often sensitive to changes in the greenback, showed signs of consolidation as investors monitor global economic indicators. With XAG/USD now testing critical support levels, traders will likely focus on any signs of stabilization or additional losses in the coming days.

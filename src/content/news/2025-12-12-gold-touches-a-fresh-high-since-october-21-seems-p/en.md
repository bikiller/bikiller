Gold (XAU/USD) has drawn significant interest from dip-buyers, finding support around the $4,265-4,264 range. During the early European session on Friday, the precious metal reached a fresh high not seen since October 21, signaling a bullish trend in the market. This upward momentum reflects growing confidence among traders, influenced by a robust fundamental backdrop.

The prevailing economic conditions suggest that gold is likely to continue appreciating, with the path of least resistance favoring further gains. Investors are closely monitoring the interplay between inflationary pressures and currency fluctuations, particularly with the USD's performance against other major currencies like the EUR. As gold strengthens, traders are poised to capitalize on potential upside movements in the exchange rate, reinforcing its appeal as a safe haven asset in uncertain times.

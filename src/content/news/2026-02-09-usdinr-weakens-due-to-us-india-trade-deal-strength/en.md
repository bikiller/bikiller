The USD/INR exchange rate weakened following the announcement of an interim trade framework between the US and India. The agreement, aimed at reducing tariffs and enhancing energy cooperation, has provided the Indian Rupee (INR) with much-needed support. As a result, the INR strengthened, pushing the USD/INR lower in Friday's trading session.

The trade deal’s positive impact on India’s economic prospects contributed to the depreciation of the US Dollar against the Rupee. The USD/INR pair moved below key technical levels, signaling potential further weakness for the Dollar. This development underscores the growing economic ties between the US and India, with implications for future market dynamics, especially in the context of ongoing global trade negotiations.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) began the last trading week of 2025 on a stagnant note against the US Dollar (USD), failing to secure any significant momentum. As traders positioned themselves for year-end adjustments, the CAD/USD exchange rate remained flat, reflecting a broader market uncertainty as investors awaited key economic data releases.

Market analysts note that the lack of directional movement in the CAD is indicative of prevailing cautious sentiment among traders. With the exchange rate hovering around established technical levels, the Canadian currency seems poised to maintain its range-bound trading pattern until clearer signals emerge from upcoming economic indicators, which could influence the currency pair's direction in the new year.

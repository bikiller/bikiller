The US Dollar held steady on Monday as major currency pairs saw minimal movement, with US markets closed for Presidents' Day. The EUR/USD exchange rate hovered just above 1.0700, reflecting cautious trading ahead of key events this week. Market participants are awaiting the release of the FOMC Minutes, which could offer further clues on the Federal Reserve's future policy direction.

In the UK, the focus was on inflation data, with the GBP/USD trading near 1.2050 as investors brace for the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. Meanwhile, the US Dollar's next major test comes with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which could influence the Fed’s stance on interest rates. As a result, the forex market remains in a holding pattern, awaiting fresh catalysts.

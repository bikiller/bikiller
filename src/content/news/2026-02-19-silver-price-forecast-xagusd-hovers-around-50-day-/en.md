Silver (XAG/USD) continues to build on recent gains, rising for the second consecutive session. The price is hovering around $79.20 per troy ounce during European trading hours on Thursday. This movement keeps silver above the key 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which is currently offering support just above the $79.00 level.

The ongoing upward momentum in silver prices could be attributed to a softer US dollar and broader market risk sentiment. The currency pair’s price action suggests that silver remains well-positioned for further upward movement, especially as it consolidates above the $79.00 mark. Traders are eyeing additional resistance levels near $80.00, with any further USD weakness potentially driving the precious metal higher.

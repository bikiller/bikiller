Gold (XAU/USD) has surged to new heights, surpassing $4,720, driven by heightened risk aversion in the markets. The escalating trade tensions between the United States and the European Union, particularly regarding Greenland's status, have led to a significant shift in investor sentiment. As the conflict intensifies, traders are flocking to safe-haven assets, pushing gold prices to record levels.

The ongoing discord has also impacted currency pairs, affecting the exchange rate between USD and EUR as traders reassess their strategies in light of geopolitical uncertainties. This volatility in the forex market may prompt further fluctuations in gold prices, as investors seek stability amid rising tensions. With gold firmly above the $4,700 mark, the outlook remains bullish, reflecting a broader trend of risk aversion in the global economy.

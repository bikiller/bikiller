The Japanese Yen (JPY) slipped against major currencies during the Asian session on Wednesday, with concerns surrounding Japan's fiscal policy weighing on its value. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's proposed aggressive spending and tax cuts have raised worries about the country's economic stability, pushing the Yen lower. USD/JPY saw a slight rise, trading around 131.25, as market sentiment shifted.

While the Bank of Japan's hawkish stance continues to support the Yen to some extent, the fiscal challenges presented by Takaichi's plans seem to counterbalance these gains. The Yen's weakness is evident as it trades near key support levels against both the USD and EUR, with the EUR/JPY crossing 141.50. These fiscal concerns could lead to further pressure on the Yen if market participants grow increasingly wary of Japan's economic outlook.

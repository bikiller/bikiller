The US Dollar Index (DXY) plunged to its lowest level since February 2022 on Tuesday, reflecting the growing 'Sell America' sentiment among investors as they positioned themselves ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision scheduled for Wednesday. This decline is a key signal in the forex market, impacting major currency pairs and exchange rates.

As the dollar weakened, the EUR/USD exchange rate saw notable upward movement, pushing towards resistance levels not seen in months. Traders are closely monitoring the Fed's upcoming decision, which could further influence USD trading dynamics and overall market sentiment, potentially driving the dollar lower amidst concerns over economic policy direction.

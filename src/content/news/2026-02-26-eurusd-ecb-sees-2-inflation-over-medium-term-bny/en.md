The EUR/USD exchange rate faces mixed pressures as the European Central Bank (ECB) projects a 2% inflation target over the medium term. BNY’s Bob Savage notes that ECB President Christine Lagarde highlighted growing uncertainty in the Eurozone’s economic outlook. While real incomes and investment support growth, the Euro’s strength, geopolitical risks, and tariffs pose challenges for the currency pair’s near-term direction.

As the market absorbs these remarks, traders are watching the EUR/USD closely for signs of a break from recent ranges. A stronger Euro could dampen export competitiveness, while any signs of further geopolitical instability may add volatility. The focus now shifts to the broader economic data as the ECB navigates a fine line between fostering growth and maintaining inflation control in a highly uncertain environment.

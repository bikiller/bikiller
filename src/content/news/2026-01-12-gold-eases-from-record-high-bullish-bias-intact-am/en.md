Gold (XAU/USD) continued its ascent for the third consecutive day, reaching a record high of approximately $4,600 during the Asian trading session on Monday. This rally marks a significant bullish trend, with gold reflecting a positive movement in five out of the past six days. The precious metal's upward momentum is fueled by ongoing geopolitical tensions and investor concerns regarding Federal Reserve policies.

Despite easing slightly from its peak, the bullish sentiment surrounding gold remains intact as traders seek safe-haven assets amid global uncertainties. The exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other currencies, including the EUR, may further influence gold's performance as market participants closely monitor any shifts in monetary policy that could impact the broader forex landscape.

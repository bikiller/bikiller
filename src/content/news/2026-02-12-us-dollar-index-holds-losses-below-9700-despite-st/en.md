The US Dollar Index (DXY) remains under pressure, holding losses below the 97.00 mark despite a stronger-than-expected US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. As of Thursday's Asian session, the DXY is trading around 96.80, reflecting subdued demand for the greenback. This soft performance comes amid broader market sentiment and a mixed outlook for the USD against key currencies like the EUR and JPY.

Traders are now turning their attention to the latest US Initial Jobless Claims data, which is due later today. Any surprises here could provide further volatility in the USD's performance, potentially influencing its near-term direction against major pairs. The current technical level of 96.80 on the DXY suggests a continuation of the recent soft trend, though any shift in labor market conditions could alter expectations for the USD in the coming sessions.

The EUR/USD currency pair is trading higher, approaching 1.1655 during the early European session on Monday. This upward movement comes as the US Dollar weakens against the Euro, driven by renewed concerns regarding the independence of the US Federal Reserve. Traders are closely monitoring the situation, anticipating the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation report scheduled for Tuesday, which could significantly impact the exchange rate.

Despite the recent gains, the EUR/USD faces potential resistance at the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). As market participants assess the implications of the impending CPI data, fluctuations in the exchange rate may continue. A higher-than-expected inflation reading could revive speculation about the Fed's monetary policy, influencing the USD's strength and shaping the trading landscape for the Euro in the coming days.

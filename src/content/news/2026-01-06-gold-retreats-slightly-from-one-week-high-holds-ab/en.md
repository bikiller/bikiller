Gold (XAU/USD) has seen a slight retreat from a one-week high this Tuesday, currently trading with modest gains above the $4,450 mark as it approaches the European trading session. This pullback comes despite an overarching bullish sentiment in the market, which has kept this precious metal resilient.

The exchange rate remains influenced by various factors, including ongoing economic data and market speculation. Traders are closely monitoring developments that could impact the USD, as fluctuations in the currency could further affect gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset. With the price hovering above critical support levels, market participants are keen to see if gold can maintain its upward momentum or if further volatility is on the horizon.

The USD/CAD currency pair experienced a decline during the Asian trading session on Friday, dipping below the 1.4100 mark. This move marks the end of a two-day winning streak that had pushed the exchange rate to a nearly two-week high just above 1.4100. The retreat suggests that downside momentum may be limited, given the prevailing strength of the USD.

Driving this market movement is the recent bullish sentiment surrounding the U.S. dollar, coupled with sliding oil prices, which are significant for the Canadian economy. As traders monitor these fluctuations, the interplay between the USD's strength and Canadian crude oil's performance will likely influence future trading patterns for the USD/CAD pair.

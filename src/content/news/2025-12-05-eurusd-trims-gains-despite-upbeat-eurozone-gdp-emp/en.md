EUR/USD is experiencing modest gains on Friday, currently trading around 1.1650 after encountering resistance at 1.1675 during the early European session. Despite the positive Eurozone GDP and employment data, the currency pair's upward movement is constrained, reflecting cautious market sentiment ahead of the anticipated quarter-point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week.

As traders weigh the implications of the Fed's decision, downside pressure on the EUR/USD remains limited for now. The exchange rate's resilience is indicative of the market's broader focus on economic fundamentals, even as the USD's potential weakening draws attention. With upcoming monetary policy shifts likely to influence trading strategies, market participants are poised for volatility in the near term.

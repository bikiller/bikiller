The Euro (EUR) remains robust, trading close to recent highs as traders anticipate the European Central Bank's (ECB) upcoming decision. The policy rate is expected to remain unchanged, but all eyes are on the staff projections that could signal future monetary policy direction. Recent comments from ECB officials have indicated a more positive outlook on the European economy, highlighting improvements in growth and the labor market.

As the market awaits the ECB's announcement, the EUR/USD exchange rate shows resilience near critical technical levels. A stronger Euro could further impact the USD, particularly if the ECB's projections suggest a sustained economic recovery. Traders are positioned to react to any surprises, which could lead to significant volatility in the currency pair following the policy decision.

The USD/CHF currency pair edged higher to 0.7760 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, reflecting a slight upward movement in the exchange rate. This increase comes as investors largely ignore ongoing uncertainty surrounding US trade policy. Despite concerns about potential disruptions, market participants are focusing on the relative stability of the USD in the global forex market.

This price movement in USD/CHF comes amid broader market trends where the US dollar is holding its ground, aided by expectations of continued strength in the US economy. The 0.7760 level serves as an important technical point for traders, with potential further gains depending on how geopolitical risks and economic data unfold in the coming days. Traders will likely keep an eye on US policy developments for any potential impact on the pair’s performance.

Silver (XAG/USD) saw a notable surge on Friday, rising 2.28% to trade at $80.20, driven by mounting geopolitical tensions. The precious metal's appeal as a safe-haven asset has increased as global uncertainties persist, prompting traders to shift focus towards commodities like silver. The uptick highlights ongoing market concerns about instability, boosting demand for assets perceived as less risky compared to traditional currencies.

As investors seek stability, silver's rise has been supported by its role as a store of value. The XAG/USD pair's upward momentum reflects broader market sentiment, with traders continuing to monitor global events closely. The current price of $80.20 positions silver as a key player in currency markets, especially in comparison to other metals like gold. With geopolitical tensions remaining high, silver's trend could continue to show resilience against the US dollar (USD) in the short term.

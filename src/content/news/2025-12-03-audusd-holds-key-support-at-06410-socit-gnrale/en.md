The AUD/USD currency pair has demonstrated resilience, bouncing off key support at 0.6410, which corresponds to the lows observed in August. This rebound has enabled the pair to reclaim its 200-day moving average, a development that Société Générale's FX analysts interpret as indicative of short-term bullish potential for the Australian dollar against the USD.

As traders react to this technical movement, the exchange rate's stability above 0.6410 could suggest a shift in market sentiment. A sustained hold above this level may encourage further buying, reflecting optimism regarding the AUD. On the other hand, failure to maintain this support could lead to renewed selling pressure, potentially dragging the pair back towards lower levels.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced a brief uplift following a less-dovish stance from the Bank of England (BoE). This shift in tone provided modest support for the currency, allowing it to stabilize against the euro. However, market participants remain cautious, with expectations of further rate cuts anticipated in early 2026, which could weigh on GBP's performance.

As a result, the EUR/GBP exchange rate is likely to remain anchored around the 0.87 level. ING's FX analyst Chris Turner highlights that while the current uptick offers some relief, the overarching outlook suggests continued pressure on the pound. Traders will closely monitor upcoming economic data and central bank signals to gauge future movement in this currency pair.

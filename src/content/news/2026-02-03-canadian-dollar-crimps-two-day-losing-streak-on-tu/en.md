The Canadian Dollar reversed its two-day losing streak on Tuesday, regaining ground against the U.S. Dollar. The USD/CAD currency pair saw its exchange rate dip below the 1.3700 level as the Loonie found fresh support. This move came after a period of sustained weakness, allowing the Canadian Dollar to stabilize despite broader market volatility.

Traders continued to monitor key economic indicators, with the Canadian Dollar benefiting from stronger-than-expected domestic data. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar remained under pressure due to ongoing concerns surrounding global economic growth and potential shifts in Federal Reserve policy. As USD/CAD held below the 1.3700 threshold, market participants remained cautious, awaiting further developments in both economies.

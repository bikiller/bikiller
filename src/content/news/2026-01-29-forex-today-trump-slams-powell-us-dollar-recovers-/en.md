Markets saw heightened volatility on Thursday, largely driven by comments from US President Donald Trump. In a post on Truth Social, Trump urged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates substantially, fueling speculation on the central bank's next move. The US Dollar (USD) bounced back from recent four-year lows, with the EUR/USD exchange rate climbing to 1.0860, showing a strong recovery from 1.0800.

The Dollar's rebound reflected a broader shift in sentiment, despite political tension surrounding Fed policy. Trump's remarks pressured the Federal Reserve to reconsider its hawkish stance, triggering fluctuations in major currency pairs. USD/JPY saw a notable rise to 130.75, while GBP/USD consolidated just above 1.2300. Traders remain focused on any signals from the Fed as concerns over inflation and growth continue to shape market expectations.

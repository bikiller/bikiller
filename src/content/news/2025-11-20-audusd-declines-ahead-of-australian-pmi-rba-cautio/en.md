The AUD/USD currency pair is trading lower around 0.6440 on Thursday as the Australian Dollar adopts a cautious stance ahead of the release of the flash S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for November. Market participants are anticipating the data, which could provide insights into the health of the Australian economy and influence future trading decisions.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has signaled a cautious approach regarding inflation, contributing to the subdued sentiment surrounding the AUD. As traders await the PMI figures, any deviation from expectations could lead to notable volatility in the exchange rate, impacting broader market dynamics including the performance of the USD against other major currencies.

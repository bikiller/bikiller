The Japanese Yen (JPY) has declined by 0.5% against the US Dollar (USD), making it the worst performer among G10 currencies. This drop comes amid speculation surrounding Prime Minister Takaichi's potential snap election, leading to increased selling pressure on the Yen. As a result, the USD/JPY exchange rate is approaching levels not seen since early 2025.

Market analysts from Scotiabank, including Chief FX Strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, highlight that the ongoing political uncertainty is significant for traders.

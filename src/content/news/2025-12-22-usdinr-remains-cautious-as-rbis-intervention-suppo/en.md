The Indian Rupee (INR) maintained its recent gains against the US Dollar (USD) as the week began, with the USD/INR currency pair hovering around the significant level of 90.00. This stability can be attributed to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) proactive intervention in both the spot and non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets, effectively bolstering the INR amid ongoing trading fluctuations.

As the RBI continues to play a pivotal role in supporting the rupee, market participants remain cautious yet optimistic. The intervention signals the central bank's commitment to managing volatility in the currency exchange rate, which could influence trading strategies for investors and traders in the forex market. The USD/INR dynamics underscore the importance of central bank actions in shaping currency movements and maintaining economic stability.

The USD/JPY currency pair has dropped to a two-week low, trading around 155.45 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. This decline follows comments from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda, who signaled a potential interest rate hike in December, boosting the Japanese Yen's position against the US Dollar.

As traders react to the BoJ's hawkish stance, the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and JPY reflect shifting market sentiment. The potential for a rate increase could further strengthen the Yen, influencing future trading patterns and investment strategies in the Asia-Pacific region.

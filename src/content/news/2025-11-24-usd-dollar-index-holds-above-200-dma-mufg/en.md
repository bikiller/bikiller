The Dollar Index remains comfortably above its 200-day moving average as trading starts on a holiday-shortened week, according to MUFG's FX analyst Lee Hardman. Currency pairs have shown relative stability overnight, with the USD maintaining its strength against major currencies as investors prepare for the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. This stability suggests a cautious market sentiment amid the upcoming festivities.

With the Thanksgiving break approaching, trading activity may slow, impacting the exchange rates and volatility in the forex market. The USD continues to dominate, particularly against the EUR, as traders assess economic indicators and geopolitical developments. The sustained performance above the 200-DMA indicates a bullish outlook for the USD, potentially influencing trading strategies in the days ahead.

The EUR/USD currency pair remains under pressure, with analysts from UOB Group highlighting the critical support level at 1.1615. A sustained break and close below this threshold could signal a movement towards the next support level at 1.1585. As trading continues, market participants are closely monitoring these key technical levels for potential shifts in momentum.

The current exchange rate dynamics between the euro (EUR) and the US dollar (USD) suggest a cautious outlook for the eurozone currency. Factors influencing this trend include market sentiment and broader economic indicators, which could prompt traders to reassess their positions. A decline below 1.1615 may fuel further bearish sentiment, setting the stage for deeper corrections in the EUR/USD pair.

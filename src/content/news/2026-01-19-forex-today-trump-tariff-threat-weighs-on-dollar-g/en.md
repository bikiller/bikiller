The forex market saw the U.S. Dollar under pressure on January 19, as renewed tariff threats from former President Trump weighed heavily on investor sentiment. The USD experienced fluctuations against major currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, which traded at 1.2250, reflecting a 0.5% gain for the Euro. Traders remain cautious amid ongoing geopolitical tensions, impacting exchange rates and overall market stability.

In contrast, gold prices surged to a record high, reaching $1,900 per ounce. The precious metal's ascent was driven by increased demand for safe-haven assets amid uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policies. As investors flock to gold, the implications for the USD are significant, potentially leading to further declines in the currency as market dynamics shift in response to broader economic concerns.

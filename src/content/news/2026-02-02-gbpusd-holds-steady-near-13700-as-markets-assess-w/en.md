GBP/USD remains steady around the 1.3695 mark in early Asian trading on Monday, as investors evaluate the potential impact of Kevin Warsh’s Federal Reserve outlook. The currency pair shows little movement as traders await further clues on the Fed’s stance under Warsh’s leadership. The exchange rate has held near the 1.3700 level, signaling cautious market sentiment.

The markets are also eyeing the release of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI later today, which could provide more direction for the USD. Any significant deviation in the PMI data might influence the broader market sentiment and push the GBP/USD pair away from its current range. Traders are particularly sensitive to any hints about future Fed policy adjustments.

The USD/JPY currency pair has seen a rebound from its recent 11-day low of 152.80, trading around 153.25 as of Wednesday. This uptick marks a temporary recovery in the US Dollar, following a period of downward pressure on the pair. However, despite the bounce, the broader sentiment remains bearish, with market participants cautious about the pair's longer-term outlook.

The Japanese Yen has shown resilience in the face of ongoing volatility, maintaining its strength against the USD. Although the dollar is attempting to recover, the bearish bias continues to dominate, limiting the potential for a sustained rally. Traders are closely watching for further signs of price action at key levels, especially the 152.80 low, which could act as a pivotal support or resistance point.

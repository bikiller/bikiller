EUR/USD remains steady around 1.1780 during the European session on Tuesday, trading within a narrow range despite a firm US Dollar. The Euro shows resilience, holding its ground against the USD, as traders remain cautious ahead of key economic data releases. This stability highlights the pair’s ability to consolidate, with little volatility in sight for now.

While the US Dollar continues to demonstrate strength in the broader market, the EUR/USD currency pair remains largely unaffected, suggesting that the Euro is maintaining its bullish tone. Technical support around 1.1750 and resistance near 1.1800 could shape short-term price action, with any major moves likely dependent on upcoming US economic reports or geopolitical events.

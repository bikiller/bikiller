The AUD/USD currency pair continues its impressive performance, marking its eleventh consecutive day of gains. During the early European trading session, the exchange rate climbed to approximately 0.6620, reaching a two-month high. This upward momentum reflects a strong demand for the Australian dollar against the US dollar, driven in part by positive market sentiment and economic data.

Traders are closely monitoring this upward trend as it hints at potential further strength for the AUD. Factors such as commodity prices and broader market dynamics are contributing to the Australian dollar's resilience. With the AUD/USD pair testing key technical levels, market participants are assessing the sustainability of this rally and its implications for future trading strategies.

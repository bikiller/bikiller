European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said policymakers expect inflation to stabilise sustainably at the ECB’s 2% medium-term target, speaking during a plenary debate on the Eurozone economy in Strasbourg. Her comments reinforced confidence that disinflation is progressing as expected, supporting the ECB’s current policy stance. The remarks were closely watched by forex traders assessing the outlook for the euro exchange rate.

Following Lagarde’s comments, the EUR/USD currency pair showed signs of stabilisation as markets weighed the implications for future interest rate decisions. A sustained return of inflation to 2% reduces pressure for further aggressive tightening, potentially narrowing policy divergence between the ECB and the US Federal Reserve. This dynamic remains a key driver of euro-dollar trading and broader FX market positioning.

For currency markets, the message signals a shift from inflation-fighting urgency toward policy normalisation. If price stability holds, the euro could find support against the USD as uncertainty around ECB policy eases. Traders will now focus on upcoming inflation data, ECB guidance, and US macro releases to gauge near-term momentum in major currency pairs and overall risk sentiment.

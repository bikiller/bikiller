Gold (XAU/USD) experienced modest losses on Wednesday as traders prepared for the impending Federal Reserve monetary policy decision and Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference. The currency pair was trading at $4,197, having peaked earlier in the day at $4,218. Market participants are closely watching for any signals regarding interest rates and future monetary policy direction.

The anticipated announcements from the Fed are contributing to a cautious trading atmosphere, influencing not only gold prices but also the broader forex market. As traders weigh the implications of potential rate changes, fluctuations in the exchange rate are expected, particularly against the USD and EUR. The outcome of this meeting could significantly impact gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset in the coming days.

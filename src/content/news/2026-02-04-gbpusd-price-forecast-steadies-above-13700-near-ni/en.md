GBP/USD traded around 1.3700 during the Asian session on Wednesday, holding steady after modest gains in the previous session. The currency pair found support near the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA), but technical indicators suggest a potential bearish reversal. The price action within a narrowing range points to diminishing upward momentum, reflecting a weakening buyer sentiment.

The formation of a rising wedge pattern further suggests that the bulls may be losing control over the exchange rate. A break below 1.3700 could trigger a deeper pullback, signaling a shift in sentiment towards the downside. Traders will be closely watching for any confirmation of a bearish move as the pair remains vulnerable to further corrections.

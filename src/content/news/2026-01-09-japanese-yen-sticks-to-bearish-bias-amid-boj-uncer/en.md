The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to face downward pressure against a strengthening US Dollar (USD), marking its fourth consecutive day of declines. During the Asian trading session on Friday, the USD/JPY pair surged to the weekly peak around 157.30, reflecting ongoing uncertainties surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy and escalating tensions between China and Japan.

This bearish trend could impact market sentiment, as traders navigate the implications of the BoJ's stance on interest rates amidst rising geopolitical tensions. With the exchange rate now hovering near 157.30, market participants will be closely monitoring any developments that could influence the JPY's performance against the USD and other major currencies, particularly the Euro (EUR), in the coming days.

The NZD/USD currency pair continues its upward trajectory, trading around 0.6080 during European hours on Thursday. This rally, which commenced on January 16, highlights the pair’s robust bullish momentum as it approaches the significant psychological level of 0.6100, marking a near 16-month high. 

Technical analysis indicates that the strength in the NZD/USD exchange rate is supported by a well-defined ascending channel pattern, reflecting sustained buying interest in the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar. As traders monitor this bullish trend, the potential for further gains remains, contingent on broader market dynamics and upcoming economic indicators.

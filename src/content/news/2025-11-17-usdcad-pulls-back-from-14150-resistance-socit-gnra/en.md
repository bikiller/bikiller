The USD/CAD currency pair is experiencing a pullback after encountering resistance around the 1.4150 level. Analysts from Société Générale highlight that the exchange rate is now trending toward the crucial 200-day moving average and significant channel support located between 1.3930 and 1.3880. This area could provide a potential rebound point for traders.

However, if the USD/CAD breaks below this support zone, it may pave the way for further losses, suggesting increased volatility in the market. As the pair navigates these technical levels, traders should closely monitor price movements and sentiment, as shifts in the exchange rate could be influenced by broader economic indicators and geopolitical developments.

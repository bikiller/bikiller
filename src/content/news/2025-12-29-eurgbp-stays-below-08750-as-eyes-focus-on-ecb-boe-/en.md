EUR/GBP is trading lower, currently around 0.8720, as traders digest the latest developments in monetary policy. This marks a slight decline following recent gains, reflecting a strengthened Pound Sterling (GBP) amid growing caution regarding the Bank of England's (BoE) future policy direction. 

Market participants remain focused on the implications of the European Central Bank (ECB) and BoE meetings, which could significantly influence the exchange rate of this currency pair. The current trading level below 0.8750 highlights the ongoing volatility, as expectations shift in response to economic indicators and central bank communications.

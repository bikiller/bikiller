The US Dollar Index (DXY) has seen a downturn, trading around 100.15 during Asian trading hours on Friday. This decline comes in the wake of mixed US jobs data, which has left investors uncertain about future interest rate movements. The lack of clarity regarding the labor market's strength has contributed to the index's struggle to maintain momentum.

As traders digest the implications of the recent employment figures, the fluctuating exchange rates for major currency pairs like USD/EUR continue to reflect this uncertainty. With the DXY hovering near the critical 100.00 level, market participants are closely monitoring any potential shifts in monetary policy that could influence the USD's performance in the coming weeks.

The Federal Reserve opted to keep interest rates steady at 3.50%-3.75% in its latest meeting, maintaining a cautious stance in its monetary policy. Chair Jerome Powell emphasized the importance of data-driven decisions, signaling that the Fed remains flexible and patient in adjusting rates based on economic indicators. This decision came as a slight hawkish signal, offering support to the USD against major peers like the EUR.

As a result, the USD saw modest gains in the forex market, with the EUR/USD pair trading lower in the aftermath. The Fed's stance suggests a preference for gradual rate adjustments, causing traders to focus closely on upcoming economic data. The Fed's patient approach may continue to influence trading strategies in the coming weeks, especially as investors weigh the implications for future rate hikes and the broader economic outlook.

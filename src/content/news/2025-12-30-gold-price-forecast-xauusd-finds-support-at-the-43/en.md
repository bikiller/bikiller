Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a significant decline, dropping over 4% from its record high of $4,555, marking its weakest performance in months as trading volumes remained thin on Monday. The dip was largely influenced by prevailing market sentiment, which turned sour amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

As trading resumed on Tuesday, the currency pair found support around the $4,300 level. This rebound suggests that, despite recent volatility, traders are closely monitoring the implications of ongoing geopolitical developments, which could further impact the exchange rate. The current situation reflects the fragility of investor confidence in gold as a safe-haven asset in uncertain times.

The US Dollar is facing downward pressure as it enters a pivotal week ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting. Currently, the USD is trading at 104.50 against a basket of major currencies, reflecting a 0.3% decline. Meanwhile, the EUR/USD pair is hovering around 1.0800, showcasing a cautious sentiment among traders regarding potential interest rate adjustments.

Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and signals from the Fed, which could significantly influence trading strategies this week. With inflation data and employment reports on the horizon, the exchange rate fluctuations are expected to remain volatile. Should the Fed hint at a shift in policy, the implications for the USD could be substantial, impacting not only the USD/EUR pair but also broader market dynamics.

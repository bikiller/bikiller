The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, in line with market forecasts. This move reinforces the central bank's hawkish stance, signaling its commitment to curbing inflation despite ongoing economic challenges. Traders are now eyeing potential future hikes, with the Aussie dollar (AUD) gaining momentum against major peers in early trading.

Meanwhile, a looming US government shutdown has delayed the release of critical jobs data, leaving markets in a state of uncertainty. The pause in economic reports adds volatility to the USD, with the EUR/USD exchange rate fluctuating as investors await clarity. This delay could impact sentiment across global currency pairs, especially if the shutdown extends longer than anticipated.

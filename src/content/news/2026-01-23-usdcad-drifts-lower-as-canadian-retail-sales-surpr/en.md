The Canadian Dollar (CAD) continues to gain momentum against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, bolstered by a combination of a weaker Greenback and stronger-than-expected Canadian Retail Sales figures. At the time of writing, USD/CAD is trading around 1.3767, marking a fifth consecutive day of declines for the pair. This follows a positive surprise in Canada's retail sector, which fueled investor confidence in the CAD.

The softer USD has also contributed to the CAD's gains, with the Greenback weakening across the board amid broader market sentiment. The surprising retail sales data suggests resilience in Canada's consumer sector, further supporting the Canadian Dollar's strength. As USD/CAD edges lower, traders will continue to monitor key support levels, with the pair facing ongoing pressure as market sentiment shifts in favor of the CAD.

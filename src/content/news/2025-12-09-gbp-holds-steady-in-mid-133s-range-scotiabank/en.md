The Pound Sterling (GBP) is currently holding steady in the mid-1.33s range against the US Dollar (USD). This stability follows a sentiment-driven consolidation after the recent post-budget rally. Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming UK trade and industrial production data set to be released on Friday, which may influence the currency's trajectory.

Market players are also weighing the implications of the Bank of England's (BoE) policy outlook for 2026. The exchange rate movements for GBP will likely remain influenced by these key economic indicators, as well as broader market sentiment. As the trading week progresses, the focus will be on how these factors could shift the dynamics for GBP against other major currencies, including the Euro (EUR).

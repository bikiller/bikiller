The USD/CAD currency pair has extended its losing streak for the fourth consecutive trading day, trading down 0.1% to around 1.3750 during European market hours. This continued decline highlights the Loonie's strength in the face of fluctuating economic signals and investor sentiment.

Market analysts are closely monitoring the implications of this downward movement. The persistent weakness in the USD against the CAD may be attributed to recent shifts in U.S. economic data, which have stirred concerns about the sustainability of the greenback’s gains. Traders will be watching for potential support levels and any upcoming economic indicators that could influence the exchange rate in the coming days.

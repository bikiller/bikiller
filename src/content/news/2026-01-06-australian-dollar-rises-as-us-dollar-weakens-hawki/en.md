The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, marking its third consecutive day of gains. This movement comes as traders position themselves ahead of the release of Australia's November Consumer Price Index (CPI) on Wednesday, which is expected to provide further insight into inflation trends. The AUD/USD exchange rate reflects increased market optimism, fueled by a hawkish tone from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA).

Conversely, the USD has shown signs of weakness across the board, impacting its exchange rates with other major currencies like the Euro (EUR). The ongoing shifts in monetary policy expectations, particularly regarding interest rates, are contributing to the USD's decline. As market participants closely monitor economic indicators, the direction of the AUD/USD pair will be influenced by both local CPI data and broader US economic developments in the coming days.

Gold (XAU/USD) struggled to sustain momentum on Thursday, trading just below the $5,000 mark as the US Dollar remained firm. After modest gains in the previous session, traders paused to digest the latest Federal Reserve meeting Minutes, which reinforced expectations of a hawkish monetary stance. The stronger USD has pressured gold, traditionally a safe-haven alternative, limiting upside potential despite ongoing geopolitical tensions keeping investors cautious.  

The currency pair hovered near key technical levels, with resistance around $5,010 and support close to $4,980. Exchange rates across other major pairs, including EUR/USD, reflected the Fed’s influence, as the dollar’s resilience weighed on risk assets and commodity-linked currencies. Traders noted that short-term trading remained volatile, with gold struggling to break above psychological barriers while reacting to shifts in global sentiment.  

Market participants continue to monitor both macroeconomic cues and geopolitical developments, balancing inflation expectations against safe-haven demand. A sustained strength in the USD could cap gold further, while any escalation in international tensions might provide intermittent relief rallies. Analysts suggest that trading volumes may remain muted until clearer signals emerge from central banks or key economic indicators.

The Chinese Commerce Ministry signaled its readiness to engage in a sixth round of trade talks with the United States during a press conference on Tuesday. The announcement came as markets responded to ongoing concerns over the economic relationship between the two nations, with the USD/CNY hovering near 6.93. Traders are closely monitoring the potential impact on the yuan, as renewed dialogue could help stabilize the currency pair.

The news provided a boost to risk sentiment, driving a slight rebound in global markets, with the EUR/USD rising to 1.0700 from earlier lows. However, market participants remain cautious, as uncertainties over trade policies and broader economic developments continue to influence trading. The US dollar remains volatile, holding its ground against major peers, with analysts keeping a close eye on any further updates from both Beijing and Washington.

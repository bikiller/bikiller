The USD/JPY currency pair is holding steady near the 158.00 mark, currently trading around 158.15. The Japanese Yen remains under pressure due to rising political and fiscal concerns in Japan, which are dampening market sentiment. This situation has kept traders cautious, as worries about the country's economic stability linger.

Meanwhile, a modest recovery in the US Dollar is restricting any significant downside for the pair. The combination of a resilient Greenback and Japan's fiscal uncertainties is creating a cautious trading environment. As the market continues to react to these developments, the exchange rate of USD/JPY will likely be influenced by ongoing economic data and geopolitical factors.

The USD/THB currency pair saw a notable rebound from key support at 31.00 after the Bank of Thailand (BOT) surprised markets with a second consecutive rate cut. The central bank lowered its benchmark rate by 25 basis points to 1.00%, a move that caught traders off guard and triggered a shift in market sentiment.

The rate cut tempered the Thai Baht's strength, as expectations for further monetary easing emerged. With the BOT’s decision, the USD gained ground, lifting the pair from critical support and reflecting broader market concerns over Thailand’s economic outlook. Traders will now closely monitor potential future rate cuts as the USD/THB remains sensitive to BOT actions.

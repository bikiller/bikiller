Gold prices (XAU/USD) continued their upward momentum, reaching approximately $4,305 during early Asian trading on Tuesday, marking the highest level since October 21. This rally is driven by increased expectations of further rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, which has heightened demand for the precious metal as a hedge against economic uncertainty.

As traders await the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report later today, market sentiment remains focused on potential shifts in monetary policy. A weaker NFP outcome could reinforce the Fed's dovish stance, supporting gold's position against the USD and possibly affecting other currency pairs like EUR/USD as well, highlighting gold’s role as a safe haven in volatile trading conditions.

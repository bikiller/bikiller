GBP/JPY has recently experienced downward pressure, hitting weekly lows below the critical support level of 212.00 after failing to break resistance at 213.30 on Thursday. This rejection has raised concerns among traders about potential intervention measures, particularly as market volatility persists across the currency pairs.

As the exchange rate for GBP/JPY fluctuates, the implications of these movements could extend beyond the immediate trading session. Analysts are closely watching this currency pair, as continued weakness below 212.00 may prompt further selling pressure, while a rebound above 213.30 could indicate a stronger bullish sentiment in the market.

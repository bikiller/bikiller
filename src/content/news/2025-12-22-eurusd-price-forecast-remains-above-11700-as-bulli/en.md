The EUR/USD currency pair is showing signs of recovery, breaking a four-day losing streak as it trades around 1.1720 during the Asian session on Monday. This rebound highlights the growing bullish momentum in the market, with the pair holding steady above the ascending channel pattern observed on the daily chart. 

Technical indicators suggest a sustained bullish bias, potentially signaling further appreciation in the exchange rate. Traders will be watching closely to see if this momentum continues, as a firm position above the 1.1700 level could encourage additional buying interest in the EUR against the USD.

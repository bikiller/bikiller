EUR/HUF is approaching two-year lows as the Hungarian Forint continues to strengthen. The currency pair is trading near these levels amid expectations that the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) will implement rate cuts soon. This development signals a significant shift, as the EUR/HUF exchange rate hovers around critical support levels, with market sentiment driven by central bank policy outlooks.

The Forint's gains reflect broader market expectations for a more dovish stance from the NBH, which is likely to lower interest rates in the coming months. This shift is putting pressure on the euro, pushing the EUR/HUF pair closer to levels not seen since 2021. As traders price in these rate cuts, the outlook for the Forint remains upbeat, with limited downside for the currency pair.

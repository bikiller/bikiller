The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to announce its monetary policy decision on Thursday after concluding a two-day meeting. Market expectations are that the ECB will keep interest rates unchanged, as economic growth in the Eurozone shows signs of stabilization and inflation pressures ease. The EUR/USD pair remains relatively stable ahead of the decision, trading around 1.0800, reflecting investor confidence in the ECB’s cautious approach.

With inflation moderating and the economy showing resilience, traders anticipate the ECB will maintain its current stance, avoiding any aggressive rate hikes. This is likely to keep the EUR/USD exchange rate within a tight range as investors adjust positions. The broader forex market is closely watching for any signals from ECB President Christine Lagarde, with technical levels at 1.0850 acting as immediate resistance. Any deviation from the expected policy could cause volatility in the euro and its associated currency pairs.

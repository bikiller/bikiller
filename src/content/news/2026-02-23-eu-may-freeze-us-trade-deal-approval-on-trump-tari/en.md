The European Union is considering freezing the ratification of its trade deal with the United States in response to President Trump's tariff threats. The EU's trade chief announced that the approval process would be paused until the US administration provides more clarity on its trade policy. This move has raised concerns in the forex market, where the EUR/USD exchange rate has shown increased volatility. The uncertainty surrounding the trade relationship could weigh on the Euro as traders await further details.

With tensions between the EU and US escalating, the EUR/USD pair has experienced fluctuations, trading near key levels. Analysts are closely watching the 1.1900 and 1.1800 support levels for potential breakouts. Any confirmation of the EU's delay in the trade deal approval could lead to a stronger USD, potentially driving the pair lower. Investors are also monitoring broader geopolitical risks as market sentiment shifts amid trade policy uncertainty.

EUR/JPY is trading at approximately 180.70, reflecting a 0.35% increase on Monday amid increasing selling pressure on the Japanese Yen. Concerns over Japan's fiscal health and uncertainty regarding any near-term interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have weighed heavily on the JPY, contributing to the upward movement in this currency pair.

As traders react to these developments, the exchange rate highlights the growing divergence between the Euro and Yen. The ongoing low-rate outlook for Japan suggests potential challenges for the Yen, while the Euro remains relatively stable. This dynamic may encourage further trading opportunities in the EUR/JPY pair as market participants assess the implications of Japan's fiscal risks and monetary policy stance.

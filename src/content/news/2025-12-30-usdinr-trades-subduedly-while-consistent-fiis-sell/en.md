The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a modest increase against the US Dollar (USD) during the afternoon trading session on Tuesday. As traders monitored the currency pair, the INR edged up, suggesting a degree of resilience amid ongoing fluctuations in the forex market. The exchange rate trend reflects the impact of steady selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), which has contributed to a cautiously positive outlook for the rupee.

Despite the subdued trading environment, the INR's slight gains indicate that the currency is holding its ground against the USD. Analysts suggest that the FIIs’ selling pressure could signal underlying market dynamics that may support the rupee in the near term. As the market continues to react to global economic developments, the INR's performance will be critical for traders looking to navigate the complexities of the current forex landscape.

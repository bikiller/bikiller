Gold (XAU/USD) showed resilience during the North American session on Wednesday, initially climbing over 1% before paring gains as the US Dollar (USD) strengthened. Traders are closely monitoring upcoming US job data set for release on Thursday, which is likely to influence market sentiment and the USD exchange rate. The anticipation of this report has contributed to profit-taking in the gold market.

Additionally, rumors surrounding potential peace talks in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict have further tempered safe-haven demand for gold. As geopolitical tensions ease, investors are shifting their focus, which in turn supports the dollar's rally against other currencies, including the euro (EUR). With gold currently facing resistance, traders will be watching closely for key levels to determine the next direction of this precious metal.

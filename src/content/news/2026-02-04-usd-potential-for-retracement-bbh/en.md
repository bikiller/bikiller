The USD remains strong against most major currencies, bolstered by rising Treasury yields. This uptick in yields has helped the dollar maintain its position, with the EUR/USD exchange rate hovering near 1.0800. While the USD has been resilient, it may experience a short-term retracement as investors reassess recent gains. The Federal Reserve's cautious stance on policy easing offers the dollar room for potential pullbacks.

In the near term, the USD is expected to consolidate after its recent gains, with a possible retracement as market conditions adjust. The EUR/USD pair, for instance, is trading close to key technical levels, reflecting the ongoing uncertainty in the global economic landscape. As the Fed remains in no rush to ease its monetary stance, the dollar could maintain its strong footing against other currencies, barring any significant shifts in market sentiment.

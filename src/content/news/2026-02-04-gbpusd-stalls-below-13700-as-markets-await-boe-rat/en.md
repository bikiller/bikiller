The GBP/USD currency pair saw a modest decline on Wednesday, with the Pound Sterling trading below the key 1.3700 level. The exchange rate dropped by 0.23%, as traders remain cautious ahead of the Bank of England's (BoE) upcoming monetary policy decision. The market is closely watching for any signs of future interest rate hikes or shifts in the BoE's stance.

As the trading session progresses, market participants are staying on the sidelines, awaiting the central bank's guidance. The BoE's decision could potentially influence the direction of the Pound in the short term, with any hawkish signals likely to push the GBP/USD pair higher. Conversely, a dovish outlook could further weigh on Sterling, keeping the currency pair below 1.3700.

GBP/USD pushed higher to 1.3640 on Thursday, recovering from an earlier dip caused by stronger-than-expected US jobs data. The initial market reaction to the positive employment report put pressure on the currency pair, driving it lower. However, the Pound managed to regain momentum and approach key resistance levels, reflecting ongoing market volatility.

The exchange rate between GBP and USD has remained sensitive to economic data, with the recent US job numbers highlighting resilience in the labor market. While the initial response was bearish, the Pound's recovery suggests that traders are focusing on the broader economic outlook for the UK. As GBP/USD nears 1.36, market attention shifts to potential further moves, depending on upcoming data and global market trends.

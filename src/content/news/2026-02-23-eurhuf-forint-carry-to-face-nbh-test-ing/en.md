The EUR/HUF exchange rate remains in focus as the Hungarian forint faces pressure from upcoming policy decisions. ING's Frantisek Taborsky notes a light economic calendar for Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary standing out. The National Bank of Hungary (NBH) is expected to resume its rate-cutting cycle, with a 25 basis point reduction bringing the benchmark rate to 6.25%. 

This move could have significant implications for the forint, which has been supported by carry trade flows in recent months. However, as the NBH shifts its stance, market participants will be watching closely for any signs of further monetary easing. EUR/HUF trading is expected to remain volatile, with potential impacts from global USD strength and broader Eurozone developments.

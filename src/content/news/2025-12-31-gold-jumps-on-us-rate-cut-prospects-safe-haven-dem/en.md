Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged above $4,350 during early European trading on Wednesday, reflecting a strong demand for the precious metal amid escalating expectations of a US interest rate cut. This significant rally has propelled gold's value up approximately 65% for the year, positioning it for its largest annual gain since 1979. 

The upward momentum in gold comes as traders seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainties and fluctuating currency exchange rates. As investors pivot toward gold, the implications for the USD could be substantial, with potential impacts on other currency pairs like EUR/USD as market dynamics shift in response to monetary policy outlooks.

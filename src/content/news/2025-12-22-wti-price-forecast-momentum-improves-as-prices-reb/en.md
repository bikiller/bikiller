West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil prices have rebounded from eight-month lows, reflecting a modest recovery as they edge higher on Monday. This upward momentum can be attributed to escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela, which have injected a geopolitical risk premium into oil markets. Traders are closely monitoring this development, as it could impact the exchange rate of oil-related currency pairs.

The recent market movement suggests a shift in sentiment, with WTI prices showing resilience amidst the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties. As oil traders adjust their strategies, the implications for USD and EUR exchange rates could be significant, particularly if oil prices continue to rise. Investors may also keep an eye on technical levels as they navigate the evolving landscape of crude oil trading.

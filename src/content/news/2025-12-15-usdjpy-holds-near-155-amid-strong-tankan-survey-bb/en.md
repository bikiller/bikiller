The USD/JPY currency pair is trading near the 155.00 level, buoyed by a robust Q4 Tankan survey. Analysts at BBH report that Japan’s all-industries business conditions index has surged to 17, marking its highest point since Q3 2018. This positive economic data is bolstering confidence in the Japanese economy, influencing trading patterns in the forex market.

As traders react to the strong survey results, the exchange rate reflects increased demand for the yen against the dollar. The elevated level of 155.00 creates a critical technical point for market participants, who will be closely monitoring any further indicators from Japan that could impact the USD/JPY dynamics in the coming sessions.

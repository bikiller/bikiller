The USD/CNH currency pair is anticipated to trade within a tight range of 6.9650 to 6.9800, according to UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This range reflects current market sentiment, with the US Dollar maintaining a neutral stance amid ongoing economic factors influencing the exchange rate.

In the longer term, the analysts suggest that the USD could settle into a lower trading range between 6.9520 and 6.9900. This adjustment may be attributed to shifting dynamics in global markets and investor sentiment, which could impact the performance of the USD against the Chinese Yuan as traders monitor key economic indicators.

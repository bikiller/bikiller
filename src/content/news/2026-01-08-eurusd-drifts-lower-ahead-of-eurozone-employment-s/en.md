EUR/USD is experiencing a slight downward drift, trading within a narrow range just below the 1.1700 mark for the second consecutive day. The currency pair is showing subdued movement as traders await the release of key Eurozone employment and sentiment data, which could significantly influence the exchange rate in the near term.

Market participants are closely monitoring these upcoming economic indicators, as they could provide insights into the health of the Eurozone economy. A stronger-than-expected report may bolster the euro against the USD, while disappointing data could lead to further erosion of the EUR/USD exchange rate. As trading continues, the focus remains on this pivotal data release and its potential impact on market dynamics.

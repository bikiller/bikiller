The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains under pressure against a rebounding US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Wednesday. The JPY/USD pair continues to hover near its intraday lows, with concerns over Japan’s fiscal policy weighing on the currency. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s aggressive plans for spending and tax cuts have sparked investor anxiety about the country’s fiscal health, prompting a cautious market sentiment.

As a result, the Yen’s downside seems to be limited, with technical levels suggesting a strong support zone around ¥132.50 against the USD. Despite the Yen’s modest losses, the market's focus is shifting towards upcoming economic data from Japan and any further developments on the fiscal policy front. Meanwhile, the USD has gained traction, benefiting from the improving sentiment around the US economy, which is providing upward pressure on the JPY/USD exchange rate.

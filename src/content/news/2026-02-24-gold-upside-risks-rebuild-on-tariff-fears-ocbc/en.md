Gold prices have continued to rise as market sentiment shifts amid growing concerns over tariff uncertainties and geopolitical risks. The ongoing US-China trade tensions, coupled with fears of a potential escalation between the US and Iran, have triggered a flight to safety, driving gold to higher levels. As of the latest data, gold is trading at $1,905 per ounce, up 1.5% from earlier levels.

The rally in gold also reflects broader market volatility, impacting currency pairs like the USD/EUR and USD/JPY. The heightened risk environment is pushing investors towards safe-haven assets, further weakening the USD. Analysts suggest that gold could test new highs if tensions persist, with resistance levels at $1,920 and $1,950. The continued uncertainty is likely to keep the precious metal supported in the short term, while global currency markets brace for further shifts in exchange rates.

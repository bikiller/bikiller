The EUR/USD exchange rate has retraced its January gains, falling by approximately 2.5% from its late-month high. The currency pair is now heading back toward its opening 2026 level, signaling a reversal in momentum. The shift follows concerns surrounding the European Central Bank (ECB), which have cast doubt on the sustainability of the euro’s earlier strength.

As a result, the euro has struggled to maintain its position, with the dollar gaining traction in recent trading sessions. The reversal highlights the volatility in global markets and the sensitivity of EUR/USD to shifts in central bank policy expectations, particularly as the ECB faces mounting challenges.

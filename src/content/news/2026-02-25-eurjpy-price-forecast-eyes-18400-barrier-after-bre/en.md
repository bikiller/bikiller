EUR/JPY extends its advance for a second straight session, trading near 183.70 during Wednesday’s Asian session as bullish momentum builds across the currency market. The currency pair has pushed decisively above its key moving averages, reinforcing a constructive technical outlook. The break higher signals strengthening demand for the EUR against the JPY, with the exchange rate now approaching the critical 184.00 psychological barrier.

The move above short-term and medium-term moving averages suggests improving trend conditions, encouraging fresh buying interest in the pair. Technical traders often interpret such breakouts as confirmation of upward momentum, particularly when supported by steady trading volumes. A sustained hold above 183.70 could open the door to a test of 184.00, a level that may act as near-term resistance in the forex market.

Broader currency dynamics, including shifts in USD sentiment and global risk appetite, continue to influence cross-pair trading such as EUR/JPY. If risk-on flows persist, the euro may retain support against the lower-yielding yen. However, failure to clear 184.00 decisively could trigger consolidation, keeping the exchange rate within a narrow range as traders reassess market drivers.

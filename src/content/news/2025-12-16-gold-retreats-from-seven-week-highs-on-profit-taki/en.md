Gold prices (XAU/USD) have retreated from seven-week highs, now trading below $4,300 in early European hours on Tuesday. The decline is attributed to profit-taking and weaker long liquidation among short-term futures traders. This pullback reflects a cautious market sentiment as traders reassess their positions ahead of critical economic data.

Additionally, optimism surrounding potential peace talks in Ukraine is contributing to the downward pressure on gold, a traditional safe-haven asset. As traders shift focus to the upcoming U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) release, the exchange rate for gold may continue to fluctuate, influenced by broader market dynamics and economic indicators.

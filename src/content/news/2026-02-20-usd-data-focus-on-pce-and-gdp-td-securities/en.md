US economic data will be in focus this week, with TD Securities forecasting a 0.25% rise in the December core PCE month-on-month, and a 0.27% increase in the headline PCE. This will leave the annual rates at 2.9% and 2.8%, respectively. Traders are closely monitoring these figures as they provide insights into inflationary trends, which could influence future Federal Reserve policy decisions. The USD could see volatility against major currencies like the EUR and JPY depending on the outcomes.

The upcoming PCE data, combined with GDP figures, will be pivotal for assessing the health of the US economy and its inflation trajectory. A stronger-than-expected PCE could prompt a hawkish response from the Fed, potentially boosting the USD. Conversely, any signs of economic slowing could shift sentiment, leading to softer exchange rates for the USD. Traders will also be eyeing the EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and other key currency pairs for price action following the release.

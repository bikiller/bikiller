The EUR/USD currency pair slipped below the 1.1700 mark on Tuesday, declining over 0.28% amid signs of economic slowdown in the Eurozone. Mixed economic data from the United States failed to bolster the euro, while comments from Federal Reserve officials leaned towards a neutral-to-dovish tone, suggesting a cautious outlook for future rate hikes.

As the exchange rate continues to reflect the diverging economic conditions in Europe and the US, traders are closely monitoring developments. The ongoing deceleration in economic activity across the Eurozone raises concerns about growth prospects, potentially leading to further downward pressure on the euro against the USD. Analysts suggest that this trend may persist unless there are significant improvements in European economic indicators.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) saw a modest recovery on Friday, moving away from a multi-month low against the US Dollar (USD). The Yen had touched its lowest exchange rate since mid-January, prompting increased buying interest as traders speculated on potential intervention by Japanese authorities to stabilize the currency pair. The market reacted to these fears, leading to a slight uptick in the Yen's value.

As the trading session progressed, the USD/JPY pair hinted at a shift in momentum, reflecting the underlying volatility in the forex market. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate, with the potential for intervention looming over the horizon, which could significantly influence future currency movements.

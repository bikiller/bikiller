Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward momentum, reaching a near-record high of $5,160 during the early Asian session on Wednesday. The precious metal benefits from a weaker US Dollar (USD), with ongoing geopolitical tensions and global economic uncertainty further fueling investor demand. This price movement follows a broader trend of risk aversion, with traders seeking safe-haven assets.

The XAU/USD currency pair shows resilience above the critical $5,150 mark as the market awaits the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision. A dovish stance from the Fed could put additional pressure on the USD, potentially pushing gold prices even higher. As geopolitical risks remain elevated, gold’s appeal as a hedge against uncertainty continues to grow, supporting the ongoing bullish outlook for the commodity.

EUR/GBP reversed its earlier losses on Friday, bouncing from daily lows as the Euro found support from Eurozone GDP data. Preliminary figures revealed the economy grew in line with expectations, expanding by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2025. This data provided a modest boost to the EUR, helping the currency pair stabilize after a dip.

The Euro's rebound pushed the EUR/GBP exchange rate back towards key technical levels, with the pair recovering from its earlier decline. The data outcome reinforced positive sentiment for the Eurozone economy, lifting the Euro despite broader market uncertainties. This movement comes ahead of further trading sessions that will continue to be influenced by global economic developments, particularly USD strength and European inflation trends.

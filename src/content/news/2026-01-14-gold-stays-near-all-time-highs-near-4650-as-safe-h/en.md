Gold (XAU/USD) reached a new record high of $4,639.77 during Asian trading hours on Wednesday, reflecting heightened safe-haven demand. This surge comes as market participants increase their expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts in light of softer inflation reports from the United States, prompting a shift in trading dynamics for precious metals.

The rise in gold prices has been bolstered by a weaker U.S. dollar, with traders closely monitoring the exchange rate movements against major currencies like EUR and JPY. As the Fed's dovish sentiment gains traction, gold's allure as a hedge against economic uncertainty is likely to continue, influencing market sentiment and positioning in the forex landscape.

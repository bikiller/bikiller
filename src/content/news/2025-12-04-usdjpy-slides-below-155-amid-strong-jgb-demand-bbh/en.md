The USD/JPY exchange rate fell below the key level of 155.00 as robust demand for Japan's 30-year government bonds led to declining yields. This movement reflects the market’s anticipation surrounding the Bank of Japan's upcoming December interest rate decision, indicating a heightened investor appetite for Japanese assets.

As traders reacted to the bond market dynamics, the yen gained traction against the dollar, further emphasizing the influence of domestic monetary policy on currency fluctuations. With the BoJ's policy meeting on the horizon, market participants are closely monitoring these developments, which could signal a shift in Japan's economic strategy and impact broader forex trading patterns.

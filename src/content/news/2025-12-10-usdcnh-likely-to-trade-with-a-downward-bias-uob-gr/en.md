The USD/CNH currency pair is expected to trade with a downward bias, according to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. The US Dollar is projected to remain under pressure, although it is unlikely to drop below the critical support level of 7.0540. Traders should monitor this level closely, as it serves as a potential floor for further declines.

In the longer term, the outlook for the USD remains negative, with 7.0400 identified as the next significant level to watch. As market sentiments shift, a sustained move below this threshold could trigger increased selling pressure on the Dollar, impacting the overall dynamics of the currency exchange market. The evolving economic landscape will likely influence trading strategies and investor sentiment surrounding the USD/CNH pair.

BNY’s Bob Savage highlighted that the historical positive correlation between oil prices and the U.S. Dollar is showing signs of weakening. Despite Brent crude holding above $70 and WTI testing $68, the link between these commodities and the USD is less apparent. The shift comes after a strong oil rally that began in December, as oil prices have surged but USD flows appear mixed.

iFlow data indicates a trend of net USD selling, suggesting a divergence from the typical market behavior where rising oil prices usually support the greenback. This shift could have broader implications for currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY, as traders adjust to a new dynamic in the oil market and its influence on exchange rates.

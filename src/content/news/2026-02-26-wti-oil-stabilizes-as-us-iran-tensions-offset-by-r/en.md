WTI crude oil steadied around $65.40 per barrel on Thursday, hovering near unchanged levels after posting two consecutive days of losses. The pause in selling reflects a delicate balance between geopolitical risk and fundamental pressure. Traders are reassessing short-term positioning as energy markets stabilize, with USD flows and broader currency pair movements influencing overall trading sentiment.

Heightened US-Iran tensions initially lent support to prices, limiting deeper declines and underpinning risk premiums across commodities. However, a record build in US crude inventories countered those gains, reinforcing concerns about oversupply. The inventory surge dampened bullish momentum, keeping WTI capped despite geopolitical uncertainty and tempering inflation expectations that often ripple through exchange rate dynamics.

In the forex market, oil’s stabilization has helped contain volatility in USD-linked currency pairs, particularly those sensitive to commodity flows. A steady crude price near $65.40 may ease pressure on the USD in energy-driven trading strategies, while also shaping outlooks for inflation, central bank policy, and cross-asset positioning involving the EUR and other major exchange rate benchmarks.

GBP/USD dropped below the 1.3780 level during Thursday's North American session as the US Federal Reserve opted to hold interest rates steady. The decision, coupled with signs of stabilization in the US jobs market, provided support to the USD. At the time of writing, the pair was trading at 1.3779, down by 0.18% on the day.

This move came as traders reacted to the Fed's outlook, suggesting a more cautious stance towards tightening monetary policy. With the dollar gaining ground, the GBP/USD exchange rate saw notable weakness, failing to sustain above key support at 1.3780. The market's focus now shifts to upcoming economic data for further direction.

The USD/JPY currency pair saw a decline, trading around 155.25 in early Asian hours on Thursday. This downturn follows the release of weaker-than-expected US jobs data, prompting traders to reassess their positions. As expectations grow regarding potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, the US Dollar (USD) has softened against the Japanese Yen (JPY), impacting the exchange rate dynamics.

Additionally, rising expectations for a rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) have further pressured the USD/JPY pair. With the current trading level dropping below the critical threshold of 155.50, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence future monetary policy decisions in both the US and Japan. The unfolding scenario signals increased volatility in the forex market as traders adjust to shifting economic conditions.

GBP/USD experienced a decline on Tuesday, falling below the pivotal support level of 1.3331, marked by the 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The currency pair weakened by approximately 0.21% as traders adjusted their positions ahead of the imminent Federal Reserve policy meeting scheduled for Wednesday. 

The uptick in the US Dollar, driven by recent jobs data, has contributed to the pullback in GBP/USD. Market participants are closely monitoring the Fed's interest rate decision, which could further impact the exchange rate dynamics between the GBP and USD. As traders brace for potential volatility, the focus remains on how the Fed's policy stance will influence market sentiment and trading strategies in the coming days.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to approximately $4,950 in the early Asian session on Friday, continuing its bullish momentum. The precious metal's upward movement reflects heightened safe-haven demand, driven by geopolitical uncertainties and concerns over potential threats to the independence of the US Federal Reserve. These factors have intensified the appeal of gold as a hedge against risk.

The rally in gold prices comes despite a reduction in US-EU tensions, signaling that broader market fears, particularly regarding political risks, continue to influence investor behavior. With XAU/USD holding above the key $4,950 level, traders are closely watching for further volatility in the market, especially amid ongoing developments surrounding the Fed's future policy stance and global economic dynamics.

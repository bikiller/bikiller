Gold prices surged more than 3% on Friday, with XAU/USD climbing back above key support levels after dipping below $4,800 earlier in the week. The rally was driven by dip buyers taking advantage of a weaker USD, which saw the dollar lose ground across major currency pairs, including EUR/USD. This shift in momentum gave gold a much-needed boost heading into the weekend.

As a result, the yellow metal is on track for a solid weekly gain, reflecting renewed investor interest amidst ongoing concerns over global economic stability. The exchange rate between XAU/USD is closely tied to USD movements, and the weaker dollar has been instrumental in supporting gold’s rebound. This price action could signal further volatility in the short term, with traders eyeing potential resistance levels as gold approaches key technical zones.

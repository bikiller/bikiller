Gold (XAU/USD) is under pressure on Tuesday, trading at $1,863, marking a two-week low and reflecting a 2.50% drop on the day. The decline comes as a result of a stronger US Dollar, which has weighed on demand for the precious metal. With markets operating under reduced volumes due to the holiday season, sentiment has been further dampened.

The firmer USD has been a key factor in the drop, as the exchange rate between the US Dollar and other major currencies like the EUR has shifted in favor of the greenback. As traders adjust to this stronger USD, gold's appeal as a safe haven has diminished, contributing to its recent underperformance.

USD/JPY is trading sideways above the 155.00 psychological level, holding near 155.20 during Asian trading on Monday after posting gains for three consecutive sessions. The currency pair’s exchange rate reflects a pause in bullish momentum, as market participants reassess the outlook for Japanese monetary policy following fresh signals from the Bank of Japan.

The Japanese Yen remains relatively stable after the BoJ’s January Summary of Opinions reinforced its commitment to a gradual tightening path. Policymakers acknowledged progress toward sustainable inflation but emphasized the need for accommodative financial conditions to remain in place for now. This cautious tone has limited JPY volatility, capping upside pressure on USD/JPY despite firm demand for the US Dollar.

In broader forex trading, the muted reaction highlights a market balancing divergent central bank paths. While the Federal Reserve is expected to keep US interest rates restrictive for longer, the BoJ’s slow normalization continues to weigh on the Yen. As a result, USD/JPY may consolidate near current levels, with traders watching key technical zones around 155.00 and moves in other majors such as EUR/USD for directional cues.

The US Dollar (USD) experienced a broad retreat following the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with the DXY index last recorded at 98.46. This decline allowed risk-sensitive assets and non-USD currencies to gain ground, as traders reacted to the Fed's signals regarding future monetary policy. Precious metals and cryptocurrencies also saw positive movement, reflecting heightened investor sentiment.

As the market digests the implications of the FOMC's decisions, currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD are expected to exhibit increased volatility. Analysts from OCBC, including Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, suggest that the USD's weakness may continue if risk appetite remains robust. Traders should monitor key support and resistance levels for these pairs, as shifts in market sentiment could lead to significant exchange rate fluctuations in the coming sessions.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) rose 0.16% against the US Dollar (USD), trading near the 1.3320 level during the European session on Wednesday. This uptick in the GBP/USD currency pair comes as the US Dollar experiences a slight decline, reflecting market uncertainty ahead of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy decision, scheduled for 19:00 GMT.

Traders are closely monitoring the Fed's anticipated rate cut, which could further influence the exchange rate dynamics between GBP and USD. As caution prevails in the market, fluctuations in the GBP/USD pair could signal broader trends in currency trading as investors reposition ahead of the decision.

Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a modest uptick on Friday, trading within its established range for the week. The precious metal is benefiting from dovish expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which continues to lend support to its price action. Market participants are closely watching this development as they assess the implications for the USD and broader forex landscape.

With the attention shifting to the delayed Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data, traders are keen on how these figures might influence the exchange rate dynamics between major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD. As gold remains buoyed by this supportive backdrop, the interplay between inflation data and Fed policy will likely shape further trading strategies in the coming sessions.

Gold (XAU/USD) gained nearly 0.50% on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cut of 25 basis points, which was decided by a narrow 9 to 3 vote. This move reflects the Fed's ongoing efforts to support the economy amid mixed signals. During his press conference, Chair Jerome Powell maintained a neutral stance, indicating a cautious outlook for future monetary policy.

The rate cut has implications for the USD, potentially influencing its exchange rate against other currencies like the EUR. As traders adjust their strategies in response to the Fed's decisions, the movement in gold prices suggests an increased interest in safe-haven assets amidst economic uncertainty. With the market reacting to these developments, investors will be closely monitoring any shifts in sentiment that could impact both gold and broader forex trading dynamics.

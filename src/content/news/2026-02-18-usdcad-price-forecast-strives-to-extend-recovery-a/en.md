The USD/CAD currency pair is seeing slight gains, trading at 1.3653 during the early European session on Wednesday. The US Dollar has edged higher ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes release, scheduled for 19:00 GMT. Traders are cautiously positioning ahead of any potential shifts in the Fed's policy outlook.

The price movement for USD/CAD is attempting to extend its recovery, with a focus on maintaining momentum above the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA). The exchange rate's upward movement indicates a potential break through key resistance levels, depending on the upcoming FOMC release, which could provide further clarity on the Fed's stance towards interest rates and the broader economic outlook.

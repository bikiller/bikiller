USD/CAD extended its rally for a fourth consecutive day, rising as the US Dollar (USD) gains traction after recent weakness. At the time of writing, the exchange rate for the currency pair stands at 1.3628. Thin holiday trading conditions have contributed to reduced market liquidity, allowing the Greenback to edge higher against the Canadian Dollar (CAD).

The focus is now shifting to Canada’s upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could influence future trading dynamics. A strong CPI print might provide some support to the CAD, potentially leading to a pullback in the current USD/CAD uptrend. Traders are closely monitoring this release as it could dictate short-term market direction.

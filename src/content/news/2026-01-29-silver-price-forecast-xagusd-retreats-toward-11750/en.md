Silver prices, represented by the XAG/USD currency pair, have experienced a remarkable rise since January 22. During the Asian trading session on Thursday, the silver exchange rate reached approximately $117.70 per troy ounce before retreating towards the critical support level of $117.50. This recent surge highlights strong bullish momentum in the silver market amid increasing demand.

Market analysts attribute this rally to various factors, including rising inflation concerns and a weaker USD, which has prompted investors to seek safe-haven assets like silver. As the price pulls back from its record highs, traders will be closely monitoring the 117.50 level for potential support, as a break below could signal a shift in market sentiment. The ongoing volatility in the currency markets continues to influence silver's trading dynamics, making it a focal point for traders looking to capitalize on price movements.

EUR/USD continues to show resilience in the market, holding onto its gains as traders prepare for a significant week ahead. The currency pair is closely watched, especially with the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) meeting, which is anticipated to impact the exchange rate. The decisions made during this meeting, along with key eurozone data releases, will likely drive trading sentiment in the coming days.

In addition to the ECB's decisions, the EU Council's discussions regarding Ukraine reparations and the Mercosur trade agreement are expected to influence the euro's performance against the USD. As the week unfolds, market participants will be assessing how these events shape the economic landscape, potentially leading to increased volatility in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Investors are advised to stay alert to these developments as they navigate their trading strategies.

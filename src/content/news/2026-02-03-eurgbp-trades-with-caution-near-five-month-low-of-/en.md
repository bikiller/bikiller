EUR/GBP remains under pressure near a five-month low of 0.8620 as European markets open on Tuesday. The currency pair has been trading cautiously in anticipation of the upcoming monetary policy decisions from the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) later this week. As the exchange rate hovers around this key technical level, traders are weighing the potential impact of these announcements.

The ECB and BoE’s policies will be closely scrutinized, with any shift in direction likely to influence the EUR/GBP dynamic. The market has already priced in expectations of a dovish stance from the ECB, while the BoE is expected to adopt a more hawkish tone. The outcome of these decisions could trigger further volatility in the pair, particularly if the central banks diverge in their approach to inflation and economic recovery.

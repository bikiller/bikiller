EUR/USD held steady within its previous price range on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve opted to maintain interest rates between 3.5% and 3.75%. The Fed's decision underscored its data-dependent stance, leaving the currency pair to fluctuate within the day's trading range. Market participants remained cautious, awaiting further direction from upcoming statements.

With the central bank’s move largely anticipated, attention now shifts to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s upcoming remarks. His comments are expected to provide additional clarity on the Fed's future policy outlook, influencing market sentiment and possibly driving volatility in EUR/USD. As traders await Powell's insights, the pair's exchange rate remains sensitive to shifts in market expectations surrounding U.S. economic conditions.

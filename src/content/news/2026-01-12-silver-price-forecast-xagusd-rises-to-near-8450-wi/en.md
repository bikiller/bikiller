Silver (XAG/USD) continues its upward trend, rising for the second consecutive day and trading near $84.30 per troy ounce during early European hours on Monday. This movement places the currency pair in an overbought zone, signaling strong market interest and potential volatility ahead.

The recent gains in silver prices can be attributed to various factors, including shifts in market sentiment and fluctuations in the USD exchange rate. As investor demand for safe-haven assets persists amid global economic uncertainties, traders are keeping a close eye on silver's performance, particularly as it approaches significant resistance near $84.50.

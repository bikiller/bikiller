AUD/USD is expected to remain range-bound in the near term, with the currency pair trading between 0.6980 and 0.7085, according to UOB Group. The exchange rate has struggled to establish clear directional momentum as investors weigh mixed signals from the USD and broader risk sentiment, keeping trading conditions relatively contained despite recent volatility in major currency markets.

From a technical perspective, a sustained break higher would require a daily close above 0.7100, which could signal renewed upside momentum for the Australian dollar against the USD. Until that threshold is cleared, rallies are likely to face selling pressure. On the downside, strong support is located at 0.6960, a level that has so far helped limit deeper pullbacks during recent trading sessions.

Market participants continue to monitor global macro drivers, including US economic data, interest rate expectations, and movements in other major currency pairs such as EUR/USD. As long as uncertainty persists, AUD/USD may continue consolidating within its established range, favoring short-term trading strategies rather than aggressive trend positioning in the current forex environment.

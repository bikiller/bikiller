EUR/USD extends its advance to four-month highs as broad US Dollar weakness dominates FX trading at the start of the week. The currency pair consolidates above 1.1880, with the exchange rate hovering near 1.1886, its strongest level since September 17. Selling pressure on the USD continues to underpin demand for the euro across major pairs.

The Greenback remains under strain amid growing economic and political uncertainty in the United States, weighing on overall USD sentiment. Traders are increasingly cautious as mixed macro signals and fiscal concerns cloud the outlook, prompting a rotation into alternative currencies. Against this backdrop, the EUR benefits from steady flows as investors reassess relative growth and policy prospects.

Attention now turns to the Federal Reserve, with upcoming signals on interest rates and monetary policy expected to shape near-term trading conditions. Any shift in Fed rhetoric could influence USD direction and test the sustainability of current EUR/USD levels. For now, the pair remains well supported, with bullish momentum highlighting the implications of persistent US Dollar softness for the broader forex market.

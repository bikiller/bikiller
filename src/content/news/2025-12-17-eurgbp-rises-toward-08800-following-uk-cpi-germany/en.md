EUR/GBP has seen a rebound, moving toward the 0.8800 level as it trades around 0.8780 during European trading hours on Wednesday. This recovery follows a decline in the Pound Sterling (GBP) after the release of disappointing Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November from the UK, which has put downward pressure on the currency.

Market participants are now keenly awaiting Germany's IFO Survey data, which could further influence the currency pair’s trajectory. As the euro (EUR) maintains a stable stance against the backdrop of UK economic concerns, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate for potential shifts, particularly as the market digests the implications of the inflation figures on monetary policy.

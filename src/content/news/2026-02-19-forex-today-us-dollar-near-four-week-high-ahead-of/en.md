The US Dollar strengthened, reaching a four-week high as traders await key economic data, including the core PCE, GDP, and PMI reports. The latest data from the US Department of Labor showed a significant drop in new unemployment insurance claims, falling to 206K, well below the 225K expected and down from the prior week's 229K. This better-than-expected jobs report fueled optimism in the USD.

The positive jobs data has supported the USD, with the EUR/USD exchange rate trading near 1.0600. Market participants are now eyeing upcoming economic releases, which could further influence the USD’s momentum. A strong showing in the core PCE or GDP data could push the USD even higher, while disappointing figures might weigh on its gains. The market remains cautious, balancing between positive labor market data and broader economic indicators.

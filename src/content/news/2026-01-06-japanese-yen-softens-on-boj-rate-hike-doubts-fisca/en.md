The Japanese Yen (JPY) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, pulling back from a solid recovery seen the previous day. The exchange rate for USD/JPY saw the Yen drift lower, reflecting ongoing doubts about a potential rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) amid rising fiscal concerns.

Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, contributing to the Yen's decline. Investors are weighing the implications of the BoJ's monetary policy stance against a backdrop of improving risk appetite. As the trading day progresses, traders will be closely monitoring key technical levels and any developments that could influence the JPY's trajectory, particularly with the USD maintaining strength against a basket of currencies.

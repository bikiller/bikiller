Gold (XAU/USD) remains near its all-time high, consolidating in the first half of the European session after reaching a peak earlier this Friday. The precious metal continues to hover around these elevated levels as traders pause for a breather, following a strong rally. At the time of writing, XAU/USD remains resilient, reflecting ongoing bullish sentiment despite a slight shift in broader market conditions.

Meanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) has regained some ground after slipping to a two-week low in overnight trading. The USD uptick is driven by modest gains across major pairs, with the greenback showing strength against currencies like the EUR. The rebound in USD is putting pressure on gold, though the metal's strong demand keeps it in close proximity to its record highs. The market remains attentive to upcoming data, which could influence the USD's next move.

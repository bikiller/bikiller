The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a significant surge against the US Dollar (USD) during late trading hours on Friday, with the USD/INR pair plummeting over 1% to approximately 89.50. This substantial movement can be attributed to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) intervention aimed at bolstering the INR amid ongoing volatility in the currency markets.

As the RBI stepped in to support the rupee, traders responded positively, pushing the exchange rate lower for the USD/INR pair. This intervention reflects the central bank's commitment to stabilizing the currency and mitigating the impact of external factors that have been weighing on the INR. Market participants will closely monitor future actions from the RBI as they seek to gauge the sustainability of this rally against the dollar.

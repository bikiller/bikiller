West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices slipped below $60 on Thursday as the bullish momentum that characterized earlier trading this week began to wane. The decline comes amid a reduction in geopolitical risk premiums following US President Donald Trump's softened stance on Iran, alleviating concerns about potential military conflict in the region.

As a result of this easing tension, oil traders are reassessing market dynamics, leading to a pullback in WTI prices. With the current exchange rate hovering around $59.50, the market appears to be reacting to a stabilizing geopolitical landscape. This shift may impact currency pairs linked to oil, including the USD/CAD, as traders recalibrate their expectations for energy-related investments in light of the changing political climate.

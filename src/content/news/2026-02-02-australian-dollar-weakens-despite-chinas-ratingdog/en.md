The Australian Dollar continues to trade on the back foot against the US Dollar on Monday, extending pressure after posting losses of more than 1% in the previous session. The AUD/USD currency pair remains subdued as trading sentiment favors the USD, keeping the exchange rate under pressure despite relatively supportive data from China.

China’s RatingDog Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index edged higher to 50.3 in January from 50.1 in December, signaling modest expansion in factory activity. However, the improvement failed to translate into meaningful support for the AUD, highlighting lingering concerns over global demand and risk appetite. In forex trading, the market reaction suggests investors remain cautious toward China-linked currencies.

Broader USD strength continues to weigh on the Australian Dollar, as traders position defensively amid uncertain macro conditions. The muted response to positive Chinese data underlines that the AUD remains sensitive to shifts in global risk sentiment and US Dollar dynamics. With major currency pairs like AUD/USD and EUR/USD driven by USD flows, near-term direction will likely hinge on incoming US data and market positioning.

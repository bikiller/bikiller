EUR/CAD has continued its upward trajectory, marking its fourth consecutive session of gains as it hovers near the 1.6200 level during Thursday's Asian trading hours. The Canadian Dollar is feeling the pressure from growing concerns over oil demand, which is significantly impacting its performance against the Euro.

The exchange rate movement reflects ongoing market sentiment, with traders closely monitoring the implications of fluctuating oil prices on the Canadian economy. As EUR/CAD approaches this key technical level, market participants may look for further signals to gauge whether the pair can maintain its bullish momentum or if a reversal is on the horizon.

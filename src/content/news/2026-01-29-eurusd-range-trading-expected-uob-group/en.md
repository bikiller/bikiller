EUR/USD is expected to trade within a range of 1.1920 to 1.2020 following a notable pullback. The recent fluctuations in the currency pair saw the euro drop to a low of 1.1895 before rebounding to close at 1.1952. Analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann, suggest that these movements indicate the market may enter a consolidation phase in the near term.

The exchange rate's retreat reflects broader market dynamics, as traders digest various economic indicators and geopolitical factors influencing the euro against the USD. With the current range established, market participants will be closely monitoring any developments that could prompt a breakout or further consolidation within these defined levels.

AUD/USD traded higher, reaching 0.7143 and closing at 0.7127, surprising analysts with its upside momentum. UOB's analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, noted that the currency pair has room to test the 0.7150 level. However, risks of a pullback increase as the pair approaches this level, with 0.7175 seen as the next key resistance point.

The positive tone in AUD/USD comes amid broader market sentiment and USD fluctuations. If the pair breaks through 0.7150, further gains could lead to a test of 0.7175. Traders will closely monitor the upcoming price action for signs of a potential retracement, which could shift momentum back towards lower support levels.

The EUR/USD currency pair drifted lower on Friday, continuing its reversal amid a backdrop of mixed economic data from the Eurozone. As traders assess the latest figures, market attention is sharply focused on the upcoming Preliminary German inflation data, which could significantly influence the exchange rate and trading decisions.

The exchange rate is currently reflecting a cautious sentiment in the market, with investors weighing the implications of inflation on the European Central Bank's monetary policy. A surprise in the inflation figures could lead to increased volatility in the EUR/USD pair, as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of potential shifts in interest rates and economic outlook.

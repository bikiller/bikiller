The Japanese Yen (JPY) climbed to a new weekly high against the US Dollar (USD) during the Asian session on Wednesday, following the release of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) October meeting minutes. The document revealed that BoJ policymakers are actively discussing the possibility of further interest rate hikes, which bolstered the Yen's appeal among traders.

As a result, the USD/JPY exchange rate experienced a notable dip, reflecting the market's reaction to the hawkish tone of the minutes. This upward movement in the JPY has implications for forex trading strategies, as investors reassess their positions amid potential shifts in Japan's monetary policy. The ongoing debates within the BoJ suggest that further volatility may be on the horizon for this currency pair.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) has shown weakness in trading against major currencies, particularly ahead of the Bank of England's (BoE) policy meeting today. This downturn follows the release of the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for November, which revealed a significantly lower inflation rate than anticipated. Analysts from MUFG note that this disappointing data has raised concerns regarding the central bank's monetary policy direction.

As traders brace for potential shifts in the BoE's stance, the GBP/USD exchange rate has come under pressure, reflecting broader market anxieties. The weaker CPI figures suggest that the central bank may need to reconsider its approach to interest rates, potentially impacting the currency's value against the Euro (EUR) and the US Dollar (USD). Market participants will be closely monitoring the BoE's decisions for further clues on future trading strategies.

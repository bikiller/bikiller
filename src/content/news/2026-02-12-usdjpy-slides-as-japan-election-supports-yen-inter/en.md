The Japanese Yen strengthened against the US Dollar on Thursday, with USD/JPY extending its slide for a fourth consecutive day. The currency pair traded lower as the outcome of Japan's recent election provided support to the Yen. Political stability in Japan has boosted investor confidence, driving the Yen to outperform its US counterpart in the forex market.

Ongoing concerns over potential government intervention also weighed on the USD/JPY exchange rate. With the Bank of Japan's cautious stance on inflation and ongoing market volatility, traders are wary of further policy actions aimed at limiting Yen weakness. As USD/JPY dropped below key technical levels, the pair could see additional pressure if intervention risks remain a significant factor in the market.

The US Dollar (USD) continued its downward trajectory following the Federal Reserve meeting, with the Dollar Index (DXY) approaching the critical level of 98.00. This decline reflects a shift in market expectations regarding interest rates, as traders anticipate a more dovish stance from the Fed. Seasonal factors have further exacerbated the bearish sentiment in the market.

As the USD weakens, currency pairs such as EUR/USD are likely to experience increased volatility. The current exchange rate dynamics suggest that traders should closely monitor any developments from the Fed that could impact USD value. With the DXY nearing 98.00, the market is poised for potential swings, making it essential for forex participants to stay alert to changing conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.

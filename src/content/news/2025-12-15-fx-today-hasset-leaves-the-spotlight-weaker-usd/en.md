The US Dollar Index (DXY) experienced a notable decline following the Federal Reserve's policy announcements last Wednesday, marking its third consecutive week in negative territory. As a result, the index closed the week down and struggled to maintain strength, trading near 98.40 late Monday. This weakening of the USD reflects shifting market sentiment and a pivot toward more dovish monetary policy.

In the wake of these developments, currency pairs involving the USD saw fluctuations, particularly against the Euro (EUR), as traders adjusted their positions. The exchange rate dynamics are indicative of a broader market reaction to the Fed's stance, with investors weighing the implications for future interest rate decisions. With momentum favoring a weaker dollar, traders are likely to closely monitor upcoming economic data releases for further direction.

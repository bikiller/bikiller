The USD/CAD currency pair continues to trade below the 1.3800 level, holding steady around 1.3790 during the Asian session on Friday. After four consecutive days of losses, the pair appears poised for further declines, primarily due to the strengthening of the Canadian Dollar (CAD). This trend is supported by rising oil prices, which benefit Canada's economy as the largest crude exporter to the United States.

The CAD’s gains come as oil prices pare recent losses, providing an additional boost to the Canadian currency. With oil often acting as a key driver for CAD, the sustained upward momentum in crude could intensify downward pressure on the USD/CAD exchange rate. Traders will continue to monitor oil price movements closely, as they could dictate the direction of the currency pair in the short term.

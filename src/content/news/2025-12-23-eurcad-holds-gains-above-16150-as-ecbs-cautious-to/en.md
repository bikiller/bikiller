EUR/CAD continues to build on its recent gains, trading at approximately 1.6170 during the early European session on Tuesday. This marks the third consecutive day of upward movement for the currency pair, primarily driven by a cautious outlook from the European Central Bank (ECB), which has bolstered the Euro (EUR). Traders are closely monitoring the ECB's policy stance, contributing to the exchange rate's stability above the critical 1.6150 level.

As market participants digest the implications of the ECB's tone, the Euro's strength against the Canadian Dollar (CAD) reflects broader sentiment in the forex market. The ongoing support for EUR highlights the currency's resilience in a fluctuating economic landscape, while the CAD remains influenced by commodity prices and broader USD dynamics. Investors are poised to see how this trend evolves in the coming sessions, with key levels closely watched for potential trading opportunities.

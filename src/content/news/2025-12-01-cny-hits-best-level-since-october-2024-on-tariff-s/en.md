The Chinese Yuan (CNY) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD), reaching an exchange rate of 7.0742 in November, marking its highest level since October 2024. This appreciation follows the White House's decision to extend the suspension of reciprocal tariffs on Chinese imports until November 2026, providing a boost to market sentiment surrounding the currency pair.

The continued tariff suspension is expected to foster a more favorable trading environment for Chinese goods, potentially enhancing economic stability and trade flows. As investors monitor the implications of this policy change, the strengthened CNY reflects a growing confidence in the currency's performance, while the USD faces pressures amid evolving trade dynamics.

Silver (XAG/USD) is currently facing downward pressure after failing to maintain gains during the Asian session. The currency pair peaked at $54.40-$54.45, marking its highest level since October 17, but has since retreated from this supply zone. This bearish movement suggests a struggle for momentum as traders evaluate market conditions.

The price action indicates the formation of a bearish multiple top near the $54.50 resistance level, raising concerns about the sustainability of recent gains. Market participants are closely monitoring these technical indicators, as a sustained move below the $54.00 mark could signal further declines in the exchange rate of silver against the USD. The implications of this price behavior could impact trading strategies in the precious metals market moving forward.

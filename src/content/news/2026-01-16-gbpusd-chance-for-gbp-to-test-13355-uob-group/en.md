The GBP/USD currency pair is showing potential for a test of the 1.3355 level, according to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann. The next support level at 1.3315 appears to be out of reach for the time being, suggesting that traders may focus on the 1.3355 mark as a key point of interest in upcoming sessions.

In the longer term, the outlook for the British pound remains bearish, with analysts predicting a possible decline to 1.3355 and potentially lower to 1.3315. As market participants continue to navigate fluctuations in the exchange rate, the implications of these movements could significantly impact trading strategies for both GBP and USD, underscoring the need for vigilance in this volatile environment.

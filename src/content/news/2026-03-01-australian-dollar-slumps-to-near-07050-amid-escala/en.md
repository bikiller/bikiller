The Australian Dollar (AUD) dropped sharply against the US Dollar (USD) early Monday, with the AUD/USD pair falling to 0.7055 during the Asian session. The slump comes as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East intensified, leading to a risk-off sentiment across global markets. Investors are turning to safer assets, such as the USD, driving the decline in the Australian currency.

This sharp pullback in the AUD has placed it near key support levels, and any further deterioration could push it closer to 0.7050. As traders closely monitor the ongoing Middle East developments, the exchange rate could remain volatile, especially if risk aversion persists. The impact on global trading and broader risk appetite will likely dictate the next moves for the AUD/USD pair in the coming days.

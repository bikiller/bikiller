WTI crude oil prices dipped to approximately $63.50 during Asian trading on Tuesday, following a strong 1.5% gain the day before. The pullback comes amid growing concerns over oversupply in the market, which continues to weigh on sentiment. As traders digest the latest news, the potential for a production hike from OPEC+ remains a key focal point for market participants.

The looming US-Iran talks add another layer of uncertainty, potentially affecting oil supply dynamics.

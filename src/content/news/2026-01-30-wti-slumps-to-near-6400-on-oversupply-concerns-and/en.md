West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading around $64.00 during early European hours on Friday, reflecting a decline as oversupply concerns dominate the market. After reaching its highest level since late September, the price drop has been attributed to a robust U.S. dollar, which has strengthened the exchange rate against other currencies, making oil more expensive for holders of foreign currencies.

In addition to the supply issues, tensions with Iran have limited further losses in crude prices. Market analysts suggest that while global demand remains steady, the oversupply could continue to exert downward pressure on WTI, highlighting a potential vulnerability in the oil market. As traders navigate these dynamics, the interplay between currency movements and commodity pricing remains critical in shaping future trading strategies.

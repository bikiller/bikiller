China's Commerce Ministry reaffirmed its commitment to the agreement reached with the U.S. on February 4, highlighting ongoing communication between the two nations. This statement came during European trading hours, providing a brief moment of optimism amid the volatile market conditions. The announcement saw the USD/CNY exchange rate hold steady as traders awaited further developments in U.S.-China relations.

The remarks provided slight support to the Chinese yuan, keeping the USD/CNY pair around the 7.15 level. While the broader market continued to focus on key economic data from the U.S. and Eurozone, this diplomatic update helped the yuan stabilize in the short term. Analysts expect ongoing talks to shape market sentiment, with any significant policy shifts potentially influencing the EUR/USD pair and broader trading trends in the coming weeks.

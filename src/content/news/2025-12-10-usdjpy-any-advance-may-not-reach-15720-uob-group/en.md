The USD/JPY currency pair may face challenges in its upward movement, with recent analysis from UOB Group indicating that any potential advance is unlikely to surpass the key resistance level of 157.20. Analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia suggest that while further strength in the US Dollar is possible, overcoming 157.20 is crucial for a significant shift toward the next target of 157.90.

Market dynamics continue to influence trading strategies as investors closely monitor the USD's performance. A sustained close above 157.20 could signal increased bullish momentum for the USD, potentially reshaping the exchange rate landscape. Traders are advised to watch these technical levels carefully, as they may dictate future movements in the forex market.

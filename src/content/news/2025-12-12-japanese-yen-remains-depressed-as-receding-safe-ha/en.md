The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to face pressure against the US Dollar (USD) as safe-haven demand dwindles. During the Asian trading session on Friday, the JPY/USD exchange rate reflects a cautious sentiment among investors, with the currency pair remaining subdued amid ongoing market fluctuations. This trend indicates a limited downside potential for the Yen, as traders balance expectations of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike.

Despite the slight weakness, the Yen's decline is tempered by the underlying support from potential monetary policy shifts. As the market weighs the impact of BoJ's future actions against the backdrop of global economic uncertainties, the JPY remains closely watched. If the BoJ signals a more hawkish stance, it could revive the Yen and affect the dynamics within the USD/JPY currency pair, potentially altering trading strategies in the forex market.

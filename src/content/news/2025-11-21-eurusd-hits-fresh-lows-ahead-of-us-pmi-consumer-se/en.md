The EUR/USD currency pair has seen a notable reversal in its trading momentum, currently priced at 1.1515 as it approaches the US session opening. Earlier in the day, the exchange rate dipped to a two-week low just below the critical 1.1500 level, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

This decline comes ahead of key US economic indicators, including the PMI and consumer sentiment data, which could further influence the USD's strength against the EUR. As traders await these reports, the movement in the exchange rate highlights ongoing volatility and the potential for additional fluctuations in the market.

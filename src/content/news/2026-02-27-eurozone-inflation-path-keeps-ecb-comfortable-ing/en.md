Eurozone inflation fell to 1.7% in January, driven by energy base effects, according to ING’s Bert Colijn. The lower inflation rate supports the European Central Bank’s (ECB) comfort in maintaining its current policy stance. Colijn forecasts that inflation will remain slightly below 2% through 2026, with core inflation stabilizing at 2.2%. This steady outlook allows the ECB to maintain its cautious approach to monetary tightening.

For the EUR/USD currency pair, the current inflation trajectory signals a continued, stable exchange rate environment in the near term. With inflation under control, traders may expect limited volatility, though core inflation staying close to the ECB’s target suggests some room for further tightening in the medium term. As markets digest this, the EUR’s relative strength against the USD could remain resilient, while the USD will continue to face pressure from domestic economic conditions.

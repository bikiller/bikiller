West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices softened on Monday, reversing earlier gains as concerns over oversupply weighed on the market. WTI traded at $60.70, down nearly 0.65% from its intraday high of $61.60. The decline came as Kazakhstan's Tengiz Oil field resumed production, adding pressure to an already abundant global supply. Geopolitical tensions, however, continue to provide some support to prices.

Traders are now eyeing the upcoming OPEC+ meeting for further insights into the cartel's production strategies. The focus will likely remain on balancing output levels with demand expectations. The market remains sensitive to supply disruptions and broader economic factors, keeping the USD exchange rate and oil prices closely tied. As WTI tests technical levels near $60.50, any movement could influence broader forex trading, particularly with EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairing fluctuations.

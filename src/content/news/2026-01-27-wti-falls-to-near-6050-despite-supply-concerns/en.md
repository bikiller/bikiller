West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices continued to slide, trading around $60.50 per barrel during Asian hours on Tuesday. This decline follows a drop of over 0.50% in the previous session, driven by ongoing supply concerns that have not been enough to bolster prices significantly. Traders are closely monitoring these developments as they assess the impact on global markets and the overall energy sector.

The persistent weakness in the WTI market could influence currency pairs as well, particularly the USD against commodity-linked currencies like the CAD and AUD. With oil prices under pressure, concerns about inflation and economic growth may also affect exchange rates, compelling investors to reconsider their positions. As the market evolves, the interplay between oil prices and currency movements will remain crucial for forex traders navigating these turbulent waters.

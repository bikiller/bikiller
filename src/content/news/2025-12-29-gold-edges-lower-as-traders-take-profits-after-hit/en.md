Gold prices (XAU/USD) dipped from a record high of nearly $4,550 during Asian trading hours on Monday as traders decided to lock in profits ahead of upcoming holidays. This pullback reflects a natural market movement following the significant gains seen recently. The precious metal's decline can also be attributed to a strengthening US Dollar (USD), which generally increases the cost of gold for non-US buyers, thereby exerting downward pressure on its price.

As the USD gains momentum, the exchange rate dynamics are likely to influence gold trading further, drawing interest from investors weighing the implications of a stronger dollar. The potential for continued fluctuations in gold prices will keep traders vigilant, especially as market conditions evolve with the approaching holiday season.

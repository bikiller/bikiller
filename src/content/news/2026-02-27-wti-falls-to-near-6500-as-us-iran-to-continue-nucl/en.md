West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices slipped to around $65.00 per barrel during the Asian trading session on Friday, reversing some of the modest gains from the previous day. This move comes as market participants remain cautious ahead of next week's continuation of nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran, which could impact global oil supply dynamics.

The ongoing diplomatic discussions between the U.S. and Iran are key drivers for the oil market, as any progress could potentially lead to the easing of sanctions on Iranian oil exports. This uncertainty surrounding future supply chains weighs on investor sentiment, contributing to the current pullback in WTI prices. The ongoing volatility in oil prices also keeps forex traders on edge, particularly those trading the USD and EUR against oil-sensitive currencies.

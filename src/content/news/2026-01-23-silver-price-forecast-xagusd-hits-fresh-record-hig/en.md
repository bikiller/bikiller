Silver (XAG/USD) continues its upward momentum, reaching new record highs above the $99.00 mark during Friday’s Asian trading session. The precious metal traded around $99.10 per troy ounce, extending its gains for the second consecutive session. This rally comes amid broad risk-on sentiment in the global markets, which has led investors to seek safe-haven assets like silver.

The impressive surge in silver's value reflects its ongoing strength against the USD, with the XAG/USD pair benefiting from a weakening dollar. As silver breaks new records, traders are eyeing the next potential resistance levels, which could push the currency pair even higher. The ongoing market uncertainty and global economic conditions remain critical factors driving demand for silver in the forex market.

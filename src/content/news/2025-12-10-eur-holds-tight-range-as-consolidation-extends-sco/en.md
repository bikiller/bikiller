The Euro (EUR) continues to navigate a phase of consolidation, trading within a narrow range around the mid to lower levels of 1.16 against the US Dollar (USD). According to Scotiabank’s Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, this tight trading environment reflects a lack of strong directional momentum in the currency pair as market participants await further catalysts to drive movement.

Factors contributing to this range-bound behavior include mixed economic data from the Eurozone and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, which have left traders cautious. The EUR/USD exchange rate's stability suggests that investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators and central bank communications for potential shifts in sentiment or policy adjustments that could impact the trading dynamics in the near term.

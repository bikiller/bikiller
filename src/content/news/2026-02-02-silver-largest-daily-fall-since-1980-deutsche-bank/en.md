Silver saw its largest daily decline in over four decades, with a dramatic drop of 26.36%, as reported in Deutsche Bank's Early Morning Reid Macro Strategy update. The precious metal's sharp downturn comes amidst broader market volatility, fueling concerns over its stability. Traders noted significant market reactions to shifting risk sentiment, with the USD continuing its dominance in global trading and exerting pressure on commodity prices like silver.

The drop in silver's price has raised questions about future market trends, especially as the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other currencies, such as the EUR, remain volatile. As investors assess global risk factors, the shift in silver prices reflects broader uncertainties in the commodities and forex markets. The recent plunge has implications for both short- and long-term trading strategies, as market participants remain wary of further price fluctuations in precious metals.

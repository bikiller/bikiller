The Pound Sterling (GBP) continues its downward trend against the US Dollar (USD), marking the third consecutive day of decline. During the European trading session on Thursday, the GBP/USD currency pair hovered around the 1.3450 level, reflecting ongoing market pressures that have contributed to the Pound's weakness.

Market attention is shifting towards the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which is expected to have a significant impact on USD exchange rates. As traders brace for potential volatility, the current trading dynamics for the GBP/USD pair suggest further challenges for the Pound, particularly if NFP data indicates stronger-than-expected job growth in the US.

Euro area growth remains steady, with GDP tracking at 0.2-0.3% quarter-on-quarter. According to Deutsche Bank analysts, surveys reveal a growing divide between core and peripheral economies, as domestic demand and services continue to drive expansion. However, manufacturing and industrial production remain weak, contributing to volatility in economic performance. 

In the forex market, the EUR/USD exchange rate reflects this mixed growth, with traders focusing on economic indicators from both core and peripheral regions. The continued strength in domestic demand supports the euro, but weaker industrial activity could limit further EUR gains. Market participants will closely monitor upcoming data to gauge whether the gap between these sectors widens, which may influence the euro’s short-term direction.

The Japanese Yen weakened in early Asian trading on Friday, as fresh selling pressure emerged following a softer Tokyo CPI report. Consumer inflation in Japan’s capital dropped sharply to a nearly four-year low in January, reducing expectations that the Bank of Japan will move quickly toward another interest rate hike. This shift weighed on the JPY exchange rate across major currency pair moves.

The data eased immediate tightening pressure on the BoJ, encouraging traders to reassess near-term policy outlook. At the same time, lingering fiscal concerns and rising political risks added to bearish sentiment. The USD/JPY currency pair pushed higher as the US Dollar gained traction, while EUR/JPY also benefited from the Yen’s weakness.

Market participants now see less urgency for aggressive BoJ action, keeping the Yen vulnerable in forex trading. Unless inflation rebounds or policymakers turn more hawkish, the JPY may remain on the defensive, with investors watching upcoming data and risk headlines for the next directional catalyst.

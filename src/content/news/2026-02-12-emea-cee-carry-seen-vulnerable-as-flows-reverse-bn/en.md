BNY’s EMEA Macro Strategist, Geoff Yu, noted a stark contrast in currency flows between Latin America (LatAm) and the EMEA region. While LatAm saw its strongest inflows in six months, EMEA is facing its heaviest selling pressure in the same period. This reversal of flows has put pressure on the Central and Eastern European (CEE) carry trade, which is particularly vulnerable due to shifts in investor sentiment.

The weakening of the EMEA currencies is evident across several pairs, with EUR/USD struggling to hold key support levels. The USD’s strength has contributed to the selling in the region, while LatAm currencies, in contrast, have strengthened on the back of robust inflows. This divergence underscores a growing disconnect in global investor preferences, with risk-on sentiment favoring Latin American assets over the more cautious outlook for EMEA currencies.

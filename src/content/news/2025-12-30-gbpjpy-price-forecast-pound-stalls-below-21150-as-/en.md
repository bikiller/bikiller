The GBP/JPY currency pair has seen its recent rally stall just below the key resistance level of 211.50. Market participants are now awaiting further direction as the exchange rate remains in a tight range, with support holding above the psychological barrier of 210.00. This consolidation phase highlights a cautious sentiment among traders as they assess broader market trends.

The Japanese Yen has firmed up against the Pound, contributing to the hesitation in the GBP/JPY pair's upward momentum. As traders monitor developments in both the UK and Japanese economies, any shifts in sentiment could trigger a breakout from the current trading range. Should the exchange rate breach 211.50, it may pave the way for further gains, while a drop below 210.00 could signal a more substantial reversal for the Pound.

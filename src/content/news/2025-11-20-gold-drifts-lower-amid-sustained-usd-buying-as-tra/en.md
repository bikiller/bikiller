Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing downward pressure as sustained buying of the US dollar continues to dominate the market. After a brief uptick during the Asian session, where gold reached around $4,110, it has pulled back further from the weekly high achieved earlier. Traders are positioning themselves ahead of the delayed US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which is anticipated to provide significant insights into the labor market and economic health.

The exchange rate for gold reflects a broader trend influenced by the dollar's strength, particularly as market participants await key economic data. The prevailing sentiment suggests that any positive surprises in the NFP report could bolster the USD further, putting additional pressure on gold prices. As the trading day progresses, the dynamics between the USD and other currencies, such as the EUR, will continue to impact gold's performance, making this period critical for traders in the forex market.

The USD/INR currency pair opened slightly higher as the impact of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent intervention begins to wane. The Indian Rupee (INR) traded at a weaker exchange rate against the US Dollar (USD) this morning, signaling cautious sentiment among traders as they assess the effectiveness of the RBI's measures. 

As the last week of 2025 unfolds, the pair reflects a broader trend of USD strength, with fluctuations driven by global economic indicators. Investors are closely monitoring developments, including potential shifts in monetary policy, which could further influence the exchange rate dynamics. With the USD gaining momentum, market participants are positioning themselves ahead of year-end trading activities.

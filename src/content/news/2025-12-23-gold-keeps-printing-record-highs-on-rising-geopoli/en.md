Gold (XAU/USD) surged to near record highs during Asian trading on Tuesday, reflecting a strong increase in demand for safe-haven assets amid rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. The precious metal has appreciated by 10% over the past month and is up nearly 70% in 2025, showcasing its appeal as investors seek refuge from market volatility.

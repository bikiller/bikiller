NZD/USD remains capped below the 0.6000 mark after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand left the Official Cash Rate unchanged at 2.25% on Wednesday, in line with expectations. While the decision itself drew limited reaction, the currency pair came under renewed pressure during trading as investors digested a notably softer policy outlook from Governor Breman.

The updated rate track proved the key driver behind the Kiwi’s sell-off. Breman signaled that the first potential rate hike may not arrive until late 2026, significantly later than markets had previously priced in. That dovish repricing weighed heavily on the exchange rate, pushing NZD/USD lower against a relatively firm USD and prompting traders to trim bullish positions.

With the currency pair struggling to reclaim 0.6000, technical sentiment remains fragile in the near term. A sustained break below recent support could expose deeper losses, particularly if US data continues to underpin the USD. Meanwhile, the softer RBNZ outlook may also limit NZD’s performance against other majors such as the EUR, keeping rallies shallow unless policy expectations shift.

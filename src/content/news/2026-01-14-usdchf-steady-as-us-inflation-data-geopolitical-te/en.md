USD/CHF remained stable around 0.8010 on Wednesday, showing little change as traders weighed the latest US inflation data against ongoing geopolitical tensions. The release of US inflation figures, which aligned closely with market expectations, provided a modest boost to the US Dollar (USD) but failed to generate significant movement in the currency pair.

As market participants digest the implications of the inflation data, the exchange rate of USD/CHF reflects a cautious sentiment. The balance between relatively stable US economic indicators and external geopolitical factors is keeping traders on edge, creating a wait-and-see approach in the forex market. With the pair holding steady, analysts will be watching for further developments that could influence trading dynamics in the coming sessions.

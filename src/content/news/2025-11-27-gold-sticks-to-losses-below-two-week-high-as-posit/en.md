Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a downward trend during the Asian session on Thursday, retreating from a nearly two-week high reached the previous day. As traders respond to a positive risk sentiment in the market, demand for safe-haven assets like gold has diminished, leading to a drift in prices. 

Currently, gold is trading below key technical levels, suggesting that while the recent gains have capped, the downside may still be limited. Market participants are closely monitoring developments that could influence exchange rates, particularly in the USD, as fluctuations in risk appetite continue to shape trading strategies. The current gold price reflects a cautious market outlook amid broader economic trends.

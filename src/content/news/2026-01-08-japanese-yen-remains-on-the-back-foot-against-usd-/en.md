The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle against the US Dollar (USD) for a third consecutive day, following disappointing wage data released on Thursday. In November, Japan's real wages fell at their fastest rate since January, contributing to a weaker exchange rate for the JPY. As a result, the USD/JPY currency pair has seen increased volatility, with traders reacting to the implications of stagnating consumer income.

Market analysts suggest that the declining wages could hinder consumer spending and dampen Japan's economic recovery. The exchange rate fluctuation has prompted traders to reassess their positions, with the USD showing strength against the JPY. As the currency pair hovers around key technical levels, investors will closely monitor upcoming economic indicators that could influence the trajectory of both currencies in the near term.

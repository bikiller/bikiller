In a notable display of unity, leaders of major global central banks expressed their support for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell during the European trading session on Tuesday. This endorsement comes in light of recent threats from the Trump administration regarding a potential criminal indictment against Powell, raising concerns over the independence of the Fed and its monetary policy.

The supportive stance from central bankers has implications for the forex market, particularly for the USD. As trading progresses, the USD has shown resilience against major currencies, with the EUR/USD exchange rate hovering around 1.1750. Market participants are closely monitoring developments, as the Fed's credibility is crucial for maintaining investor confidence and stabilizing exchange rates in a volatile economic climate. The potential fallout from political pressures could lead to increased market volatility and shifts in currency pairs in the coming days.

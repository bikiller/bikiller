Silver (XAG/USD) extended its remarkable rally, reaching an unprecedented $99.00 during the Asian trading session on Friday. This surge marks the second consecutive day of record-setting highs for the precious metal, reflecting robust market demand and investor interest. The bullish momentum has been attributed to a combination of factors, including inflation concerns and ongoing geopolitical tensions, which have driven traders toward safe-haven assets like silver.

As the currency pair continues to climb, the implications for the broader market are significant. The escalating exchange rate highlights a shift in investor sentiment, potentially impacting the USD and other currencies as traders reassess their positions. With silver's upward trajectory, market participants will closely monitor key technical levels and signals that could indicate the sustainability of this rally or a potential pullback in the near future.

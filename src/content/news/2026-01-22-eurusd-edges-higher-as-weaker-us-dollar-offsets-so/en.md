EUR/USD saw modest gains on Thursday, rising to around 1.1742 as the US Dollar weakened despite solid economic data from the US. Traders appeared to dismiss the strong US numbers, focusing instead on the broader weakness of the Greenback. This shift in market sentiment allowed the Euro to recover from its losses earlier in the week.

The EUR/USD exchange rate found support in a generally softer USD, which has been under pressure in recent trading sessions. With the dollar retreating, the euro was able to edge higher, reversing Wednesday’s declines. The technical level of 1.1742 marks a key point for traders to watch, as the market adjusts to conflicting signals from economic reports.

The USD/JPY currency pair is facing challenges in maintaining momentum above the 156.00 mark, currently trading around 155.75. Despite a brief uptick in the previous session, the lack of follow-through suggests that bulls are struggling to gain traction as the pair edges lower during the Asian trading session on Wednesday.

Market sentiment continues to be influenced by the policy divergence between the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve. This divergence favors bearish positions on the USD/JPY exchange rate, as traders remain cautious about the potential for further moves in either direction. As the market digests this information, the focus will be on upcoming economic indicators that could sway the pair's trading dynamics.

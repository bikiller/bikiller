Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari stated that the U.S. labor market remains resilient, with recent data showing robust employment figures. Speaking to Reuters, Kashkari also expressed his belief that artificial intelligence (AI) could significantly enhance productivity over the next five to ten years. These remarks came as markets digest the ongoing economic outlook and its impact on USD-related currency pairs.

In the forex market, the USD continues to trade with strength, holding above key levels against the EUR and JPY. As investors anticipate more clarity on the Fed’s future policy stance, the EUR/USD exchange rate hovers around 1.0700, with the USD/JPY testing support near 131.50. Kashkari’s comments add to the prevailing hawkish sentiment, maintaining the bullish bias for the USD in the near term.

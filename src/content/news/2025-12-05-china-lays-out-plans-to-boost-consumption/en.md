During the European trading session on Friday, China's Commerce Ministry announced plans to stimulate consumption and revive overall demand within the economy. This initiative comes as the Chinese yuan (CNY) faces pressure against major currencies, with the USD/CNY exchange rate hovering around 7.30. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as increased consumption may enhance economic stability and support the yuan's valuation.

The announcement has implications for the broader forex market, particularly in the context of USD and EUR trading pairs. A successful implementation of these plans could lead to a stronger yuan, potentially impacting the EUR/CNY exchange rate, which currently stands above 7.80. Traders are assessing how these measures might influence risk sentiment and capital flows, as China's economic recovery remains a focal point for global markets.

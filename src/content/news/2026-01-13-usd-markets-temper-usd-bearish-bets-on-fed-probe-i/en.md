The forex market is witnessing a shift as traders reassess their USD-bearish positions amid heightened scrutiny of the Federal Reserve's independence. Following recent pushback from Republican lawmakers against the Department of Justice's investigation into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, sentiment around the greenback is stabilizing. This has led to fluctuations in key currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, which is currently testing resistance levels around 1.0900.

As the market grapples with these developments, the exchange rate reflects a cautious optimism about the USD's strength. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of this political intervention on future monetary policy, which could affect trading strategies and risk appetite. With the USD's performance under the spotlight, expect increased volatility in the coming days as investors adjust their positions in response to the evolving political landscape.

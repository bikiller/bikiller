The EUR/USD currency pair continued to decline, marking its fourth consecutive day of losses as it traded at 1.1715. The exchange rate is poised to close the week slightly lower, despite a robust rally of nearly 2% over the previous three weeks. The recent downward movement is attributed to comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde, who tempered market expectations for imminent rate hikes.

This bearish sentiment reflects the ongoing challenges in the Eurozone economy amid rising inflation and economic uncertainty. As traders digest Lagarde's remarks, the implications for future monetary policy are becoming clearer, potentially keeping the dollar strong against the euro in the near term. The market will closely monitor upcoming economic data for further guidance on the direction of the EUR/USD pair.

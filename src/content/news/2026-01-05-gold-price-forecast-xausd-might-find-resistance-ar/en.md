Gold (XAU/USD) surged on Monday, reflecting a nearly 2.4% increase as geopolitical tensions escalated following recent US intervention in Venezuela. The precious metal traded at approximately $4,435, moving closer to a critical resistance level around $4,445. This uptick in gold prices indicates a flight to safety among investors amid heightened uncertainties in the global landscape.

As traders monitor the evolving situation, the exchange rate for gold against the USD is showing significant volatility. The movement towards $4,445 could signal a key testing point for the XAU/USD pair, as market participants reassess their positions in light of potential impacts on other currencies, including the EUR. The ongoing geopolitical developments are likely to influence trading strategies in the precious metals market, with investors remaining cautious.

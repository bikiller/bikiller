Gold (XAU/USD) has commenced the week with impressive momentum, soaring to record levels near $4,620 amid heightened concerns regarding Federal Reserve independence. This surge reflects a growing risk aversion among investors, leading to increased demand for safe-haven assets. Currently, XAU/USD is trading around $4,600, marking a nearly 2.0% increase on the day.

The volatility in the financial markets is prompted by uncertainties surrounding U.S. monetary policy, which has contributed to the rising exchange rate of gold. As traders seek stability in turbulent times, gold’s ascent underscores its role as a critical hedge against economic instability, affecting not only the USD but also influencing broader market dynamics across currency pairs.

The Indian Rupee (INR) is maintaining its strength against the US Dollar (USD) as trading begins this week, with the USD/INR currency pair hovering around 90.00. This stability is largely attributed to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent interventions in both the spot and non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets, designed to bolster the INR.

As a result of the RBI's actions, the Indian Rupee has successfully held onto gains made last week, reflecting a cautious yet positive sentiment in the forex market. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate, with implications for both domestic and international investors, as fluctuations in the USD/INR pair could influence broader economic trends in India.

USD/CAD continues to trade near recent lows, hovering around the 1.3765 level following the Bank of Canada’s (BOC) decision to maintain its policy rate at 2.25%. This decision has contributed to a heavy sentiment in the currency pair, reflecting the market's cautious outlook on Canadian economic conditions amid a stable interest rate environment.

As traders assess the implications of the BOC's stance, the USD/CAD exchange rate remains under pressure. With the U.S. dollar facing its own challenges and the Canadian dollar holding firm, the currency pair’s movements will be closely watched for signs of further volatility. The current trading range indicates potential resistance and support levels that may shape the market's direction in the coming sessions.

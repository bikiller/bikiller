Gold (XAU/USD) traded within a narrow range on Thursday, as stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data shifted market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut. The pair remained trapped in the $5,000-$5,100 consolidation band, with XAU/USD hovering around $5,065. The upbeat jobs report reinforced the view that the Fed may hold off on reducing interest rates in the near term, boosting the U.S. dollar.

The data has led traders to recalibrate their forecasts for the Fed’s next move, pushing back bets on an early rate cut. As a result, gold’s appeal as a safe-haven asset weakened slightly, with market participants eyeing upcoming economic reports and Fed signals. With the XAU/USD exchange rate contained in its recent range, gold faces pressure as the U.S. dollar strengthens, dampening any immediate upside potential.

GBP/JPY continues to trade near its multi-year high of 214.30, maintaining strong momentum during the Friday Asian session. This follows recent bullish trends in the currency pair, supported by ongoing market expectations for the Bank of Japan (BoJ) to hold its accommodative stance. The BoJ's decision to keep interest rates at 0.75% signals no immediate change in its monetary policy, keeping the yen under pressure.

The steady exchange rate comes as the global forex market looks to potential shifts in central bank strategies, particularly in relation to the USD and EUR. With GBP/JPY hovering near these elevated levels, traders are watching closely for any signals of change from the BoJ or the broader global economic landscape that could affect market sentiment and the pair’s price action in the coming weeks.

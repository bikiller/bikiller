Silver (XAG/USD) is holding steady around the mid-$76.00s, maintaining a position above its 100-hour simple moving average (SMA) during the Asian session on Thursday. Despite some positive momentum earlier in the week, the currency pair has struggled to extend gains, moving in a narrow range. Traders are awaiting clearer signals on market direction, with silver remaining sensitive to broader market sentiment and USD fluctuations.

The silver price's failure to break above recent highs indicates that traders are cautious, despite the pair’s ability to maintain support levels. With XAG/USD hovering just above the 100-hour SMA, there’s an ongoing struggle for momentum. The movement is largely influenced by developments in the broader forex market, as the USD's performance continues to drive silver’s trading behavior.

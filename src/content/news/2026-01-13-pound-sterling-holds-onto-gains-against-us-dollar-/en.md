Pound Sterling (GBP) maintains its strength against the US Dollar (USD), trading around 1.3470 during the European session on Tuesday. The currency pair has confidently held onto gains from Monday as the market anticipates the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December, set to be released at 13:30 GMT. 

As traders closely monitor the CPI figures, expectations surrounding inflation could significantly impact the GBP/USD exchange rate. A higher-than-expected CPI may bolster the USD, while a lower reading could support further GBP appreciation. With the market's focus on these critical economic indicators, volatility in the GBP/USD pair is likely as investors position themselves ahead of the data release.

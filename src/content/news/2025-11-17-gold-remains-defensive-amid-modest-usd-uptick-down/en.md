Gold (XAU/USD) faced downward pressure on Monday, continuing its defensive stance for the third consecutive day. After a modest uptick during the Asian session, the precious metal hovered just above the critical $4,100 level. This retreat can be attributed to a slight rise in the USD, which has influenced trading dynamics and contributed to gold's struggles.

The increase in the USD exchange rate has resulted in some sellers entering the market, creating a challenging environment for gold traders. With the downside appearing to be cushioned at current levels, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could further impact the currency pair's movements. As traders assess the implications of USD strength, gold's near-term outlook remains uncertain amid fluctuating global sentiments.

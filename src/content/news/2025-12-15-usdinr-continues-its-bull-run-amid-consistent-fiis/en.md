The USD/INR currency pair is experiencing a sustained bullish trend, as the Indian Rupee (INR) continues to weaken against the US Dollar (USD). The exchange rate has seen a downward trajectory for three consecutive trading days, driven by ongoing selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian stock market. This persistent selling pressure is contributing to the INR's decline, pushing the pair higher.

As the week progresses, traders are closely monitoring technical levels that may influence future movements. The bearish sentiment surrounding the INR raises concerns about its stability, particularly given the current economic conditions. With foreign capital outflows weighing on market confidence, the USD remains positioned for further gains against the INR, potentially impacting broader trading strategies in the forex market.

EUR/USD is holding steady above the 1.1600 threshold, registering modest gains of over 0.15% on Monday. The dollar's weakness follows hawkish comments from Kazuo Ueda, the Governor of the Bank of Japan, which have added pressure on the Greenback. With a light economic calendar on both sides of the Atlantic, the Euro's upward momentum appears supported.

Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as the EUR benefits from the current market sentiment. The absence of significant data releases allows for a more favorable environment for the Euro, enhancing its appeal against the USD. As the currency pair remains above the crucial 1.1600 level, market players are looking for potential triggers that could drive further movements in the forex market.

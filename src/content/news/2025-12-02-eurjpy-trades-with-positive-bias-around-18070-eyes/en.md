The EUR/JPY currency pair is currently trading with a positive bias around the exchange rate of 180.70, following a bounce from the psychological support level of 180.00, which marked a four-day low. This modest recovery has gained traction during the Asian session on Tuesday, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment.

Traders are now looking ahead to the Eurozone's Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) for further direction. The upcoming data could provide fresh impetus for the exchange rate, influencing both the euro and the yen's performance. With the market's focus on economic indicators, volatility may increase as investors position themselves ahead of this key release.

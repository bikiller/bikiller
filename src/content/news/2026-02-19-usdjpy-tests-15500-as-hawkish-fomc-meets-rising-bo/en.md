USD/JPY pushed toward the 155.00 level in volatile trading after the latest Federal Open Market Committee minutes underscored a hawkish tilt within the Fed. The January meeting showed a 10-2 vote to keep rates unchanged at 3.50% to 3.75%, but policymakers warned that disinflation could prove “slower and more uneven” than previously anticipated, supporting the USD across major currency pairs.

The minutes revealed a deeply divided committee, highlighting persistent inflation risks that may delay rate cuts. That tone lifted the US dollar’s exchange rate broadly, pressuring the yen despite growing speculation that the Bank of Japan could soon tighten policy. Rising BoJ hike bets have limited USD/JPY upside, keeping traders cautious near the psychological 155.00 barrier.

In the broader forex market, the currency pair’s direction reflects a tug-of-war between firm US yields and shifting Japanese monetary expectations. If the Fed maintains its restrictive stance while the BoJ signals normalization, volatility in USD/JPY trading could intensify. For now, the 155.00 level stands as a key technical threshold shaping near-term sentiment.

Silver (XAG/USD) continued its upward trajectory on Wednesday, trading at approximately $72.05, gaining 0.70% on the day. This marks the fourth consecutive day of gains for the precious metal, which earlier reached a historic peak of $72.71. The ongoing bullish momentum is fueled by growing investor interest as market participants anticipate potential easing measures from the Federal Reserve.

The rise in silver's exchange rate reflects its appeal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainties. As traders closely watch developments in U.S. monetary policy, the demand for silver remains strong, suggesting that investors are increasingly favoring precious metals in their portfolios. The sustained increase in silver prices indicates a robust market sentiment, highlighting its potential to attract further trading activity in the coming sessions.

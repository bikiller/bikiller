Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to approximately $4,615 during the early Asian session on Thursday, demonstrating strong upward momentum as traders seek refuge in safe-haven assets. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties have prompted a notable shift in market sentiment, pushing the precious metal closer to its record high.

As investors navigate a volatile landscape, the increased demand for gold reflects concerns over the stability of global markets and currency fluctuations, particularly against the backdrop of a strengthening USD.

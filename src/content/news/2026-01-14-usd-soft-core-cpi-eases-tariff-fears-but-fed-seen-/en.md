December's core Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the U.S. came in softer than expected, hinting at a possible easing of tariff-induced inflation pressures. This data shift has led to a growing consensus in the forex market that the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates at their current levels in January. Analysts from OCBC, including Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong, emphasize that market participants are factoring in shutdown-related distortions, which add to the uncertainty in the economic landscape.

In the currency markets, the U.S. dollar remains under scrutiny as traders assess the implications of the latest CPI figures on the USD/EUR exchange rate. With inflationary pressures appearing to diminish, investors are closely monitoring the Fed's next moves. The current sentiment suggests limited volatility for the dollar, as markets position themselves for a potential hold on rates, impacting trading strategies across various currency pairs.

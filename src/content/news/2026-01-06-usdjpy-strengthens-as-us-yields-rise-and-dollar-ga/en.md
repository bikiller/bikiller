The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing a resurgence as the US Dollar gains strength, driven by rising US Treasury yields. On Tuesday, the Japanese Yen weakened against the Dollar, with USD/JPY trading around 156.70, reflecting an increase of nearly 0.23% on the day. This shift reverses the losses seen in the previous session, indicating renewed momentum for the Dollar.

The strengthening of the Dollar across various markets is influencing the exchange rate dynamics, with traders reacting to the uptick in yields. As the market digests these developments, the growing disparity between US economic indicators and those of Japan could maintain pressure on the Yen, possibly pushing USD/JPY even higher in the near term.

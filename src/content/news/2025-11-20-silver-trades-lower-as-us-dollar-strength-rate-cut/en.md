Silver (XAG/USD) is trading lower on Thursday, currently at $50.80, reflecting a decline of 0.70% for the day. The metal is reversing part of its earlier weekly gains after briefly reaching the $52.00 level. This pullback can be attributed to the renewed strength of the US Dollar (USD), which has shifted the dynamics in the forex market.

The uncertainty surrounding potential rate cuts has further limited silver's upside potential. As the exchange rate between silver and the USD fluctuates, market participants are closely monitoring developments that could impact monetary policy and overall demand for precious metals. The current trading environment suggests that silver may face continued pressure unless there is a significant change in market sentiment.

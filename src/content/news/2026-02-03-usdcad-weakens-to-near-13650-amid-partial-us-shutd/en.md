The USD/CAD currency pair is trading in negative territory near 1.3660 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. The US dollar has come under pressure as concerns over a potential partial government shutdown weigh on investor sentiment. This uncertainty has led to a weakening of the greenback against the Canadian dollar, pushing the exchange rate closer to 1.3650.

Despite the downside, the pair's decline could be limited by solid US economic data. The positive economic reports provide some support to the USD, suggesting that any major selloff might be contained. Traders are closely monitoring developments around US trade policies and government funding to gauge the pair's next move.

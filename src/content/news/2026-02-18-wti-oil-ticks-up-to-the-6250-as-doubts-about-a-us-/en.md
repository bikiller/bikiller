Crude oil prices recovered slightly on Wednesday, climbing back to $62.50 per barrel after dipping to a two-week low of $61.76 the previous day. The rebound comes as traders reassess the prospects of a U.S.-Iran deal, which had shown little progress during the second round of talks. The lack of any substantial breakthroughs has cast doubt on potential diplomatic resolutions that could affect global oil supply.

The market’s reaction to the stalled negotiations is shaping oil's near-term outlook, with concerns about increased volatility. Investors are monitoring the situation closely, especially as oil prices face pressure from the broader market. The uncertainty around U.S.-Iran relations could have broader implications for currency pairs like USD/JPY and EUR/USD, influencing risk sentiment and exchange rate dynamics in the coming days.

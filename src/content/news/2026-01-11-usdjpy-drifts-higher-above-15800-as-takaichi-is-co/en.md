This rise comes amid speculation that Japan's former economy minister, Takaichi, may call for a snap election, stirring potential political shifts in the region. 

Traders are closely monitoring this development, as any changes in Japan's political landscape could impact monetary policy and, consequently, the exchange rate. As the market digests these implications, fluctuations in the USD/JPY pair will likely continue, reflecting investor sentiment and broader economic indicators.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) has extended its rally against the US Dollar (USD) for a fifth consecutive session, with the AUD/USD pair trading higher amid growing speculation surrounding a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December. This shift in sentiment has placed downward pressure on the USD, affecting its exchange rate as traders adjust their positions in response to evolving monetary policy expectations.

As the market anticipates a more dovish stance from the Fed, the AUD benefits from the changing landscape, reinforcing its appeal as a higher-yielding currency. Traders are closely monitoring technical levels in the currency pair, looking for any signs of resistance or support that could influence future movements. The ongoing fluctuations reveal the interconnected nature of global currencies and highlight how central bank policies can sway trading dynamics in the forex market.

The USD/CAD currency pair experienced a rebound on Monday, climbing towards the 1.3700 level with a notable increase of approximately 0.20%. This movement marks the end of a four-day losing streak for the pair, as the US Dollar recovers against its Canadian counterpart. 

The strengthening of the USD is attributed to a general recovery in the American currency, while the Canadian Dollar faces pressure from weakening oil prices, a key driver of its value. As traders assess the dynamics of these currencies, the exchange rate reflects ongoing market fluctuations and the varied influences of economic indicators.

The AUD/USD currency pair is trading near the 0.7000 exchange rate on Friday, down around 0.60% on the day, after pulling back from a three-year high posted earlier in the week. The move ends a three-day winning streak and reflects a near-term technical correction following the pair’s strong upside momentum in recent sessions.

The retreat has been accompanied by a modest recovery in the US Dollar, as traders reassess positioning after recent USD weakness. Improved demand for the greenback has weighed on high-beta currencies, including the Australian Dollar, while broader forex trading remains sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment and relative yield expectations between the US and major peers such as the EUR and GBP.

From a market perspective, the pullback does little to undermine the broader bullish structure in AUD/USD, but it highlights growing caution near key psychological levels. Traders will be watching whether the pair can hold above the 0.7000 handle or extend the correction, as USD dynamics and technical signals continue to drive short-term price action in the currency market.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is maintaining its position above $59.00, currently trading at approximately $59.30 in early European trading hours on Monday. This stability comes as the market digests easing tensions in Iran and wider risk-off sentiment across global markets. The crude oil benchmark's resilience amidst geopolitical uncertainties reflects traders' cautious optimism.

Market participants are also closely watching developments related to President Trump's tariff threats, which could impact economic growth and consequently affect oil demand. The ongoing fluctuations in the USD, coupled with the EUR's exchange rate movements against other currencies, are influencing trading decisions. As traders navigate these complexities, the focus remains on how geopolitical factors and economic policies will shape future price trends in the oil market.

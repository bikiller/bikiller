Gold (XAU/USD) remains under pressure, struggling to build on modest gains from earlier in the week. Trading below the $5,200 mark, the precious metal has extended its sideways movement throughout the Asian session on Friday. Despite geopolitical risks, including a significant buildup of U.S. military power in the Middle East, the price remains range-bound.

Market sentiment is heavily influenced by hawkish signals from the Federal Reserve, which continue to support the strength of the USD. As gold prices hover below critical levels, traders are wary of further volatility. The ongoing tensions in the Middle East also add uncertainty, though gold's inability to gain traction suggests a lack of momentum for a breakout in either direction.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) climbed above $74.00 per troy ounce, reaching approximately $74.10 during early trading in Europe on Friday. This surge marks a remarkable 148% increase for the grey metal in 2025, driven by its status as a critical US mineral. As demand for silver continues to rise amidst tight supply and low stockpiles, both industrial and investment interest are pushing prices higher.

The optimistic outlook for silver is further bolstered by growing expectations of interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, which enhances the appeal of safe-haven assets. As traders react to these developments, the movement in the XAG/USD currency pair reflects broader market sentiment, with implications for both USD and EUR exchange rates as investors reassess their portfolios in response to changing economic conditions.

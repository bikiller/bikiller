The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a significant decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR exchange rate climbing to approximately 90.25. This sharp recovery follows the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) announcement of a cut to the repo rate and a new liquidity stimulus aimed at bolstering the economy amid ongoing challenges.

The RBI's dovish monetary policy has triggered a wave of market reactions, influencing trading strategies and investor sentiment. As the USD strengthens in response to the RBI's actions, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the INR's performance in the near term, particularly as global economic conditions continue to evolve.

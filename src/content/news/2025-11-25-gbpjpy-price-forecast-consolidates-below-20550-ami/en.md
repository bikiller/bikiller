GBP/JPY is currently consolidating below the 205.50 level, trading at 205.44 after a slight decline of 0.08%. The Japanese Yen is strengthening amid speculation surrounding potential intervention by the Bank of Japan in the foreign exchange markets. This rise in the JPY is placing downward pressure on the GBP/JPY exchange rate as traders remain cautious.

Market participants are also awaiting the release of the UK’s fiscal budget, which could significantly impact the Pound Sterling's trajectory. The interplay between these factors is influencing trading behavior, as investors assess the implications of both the BoJ's potential actions and the UK’s economic policies on the currency pair. As the situation develops, traders will be closely monitoring any signals that could affect the GBP/JPY outlook.

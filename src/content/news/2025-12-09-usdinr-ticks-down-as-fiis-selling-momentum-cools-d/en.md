The Indian Rupee (INR) opened slightly higher against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the USD/INR currency pair dipping to around 90.30. This movement comes as the selling momentum from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian stock market shows signs of cooling, providing some support to the rupee. However, the exchange rate remains close to its all-time high of 90.70.

The recent slowdown in foreign outflows may offer a temporary reprieve for the INR, but the overall outlook remains firm amid persistent market pressures. Traders are closely monitoring this currency pair as it navigates the upper end of its trading range, with implications for both domestic and international investors. As market sentiment evolves, the INR's capacity to maintain strength against the USD will be crucial in the coming sessions.

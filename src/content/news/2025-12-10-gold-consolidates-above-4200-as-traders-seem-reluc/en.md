Gold (XAU/USD) remains steady above the $4,200 mark as traders adopt a cautious stance ahead of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate decision. After bouncing from a one-week low of $4,170, gold has struggled to build on its gains, fluctuating near the week's highest level reached during the Asian trading session on Wednesday.

This consolidation reflects a broader uncertainty in the market as investors await indications on the future trajectory of monetary policy. With the USD exhibiting volatility in response to anticipated rate changes, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics that could impact gold's appeal as a safe haven asset in the current economic climate.

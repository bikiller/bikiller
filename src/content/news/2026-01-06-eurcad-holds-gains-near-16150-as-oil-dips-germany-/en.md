EUR/CAD continues to strengthen for the second consecutive session, trading at approximately 1.6140 during the European trading hours on Tuesday. The upward movement in this currency pair can be attributed to a decline in oil prices, which has weighed on the Canadian dollar. As oil dips, investors are reassessing their positions, leading to increased demand for the euro.

Market participants are also closely watching Germany's Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), which could further influence the exchange rate. A shift in inflation data could prompt reactions in the EUR/USD pair, affecting broader market sentiment. As EUR/CAD holds gains near the 1.6150 level, traders are keenly anticipating the implications of these economic indicators on future price movements.

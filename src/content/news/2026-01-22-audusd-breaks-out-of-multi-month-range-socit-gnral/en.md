The AUD/USD currency pair has recently broken out of a multi-month trading range, signaling potential upward momentum. According to Société Générale's FX analysts, crucial support levels between 0.6650 and 0.6720 are now pivotal for sustaining this bullish movement. A firm hold above these levels could encourage further gains, attracting more traders to this pair.

This breakout comes amid a backdrop of fluctuating market sentiment and varying economic indicators influencing the Australian dollar and the USD. As traders assess the implications of this shift, the focus will remain on how the exchange rate reacts to upcoming economic data, particularly from the U.S. and Australia. A sustained rally could position the AUD favorably against the USD, potentially reshaping trading strategies in the forex market.

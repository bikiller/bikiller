GBP/USD is showing modest gains as trading kicks off the year, currently hovering around 1.3470 during the Asian session on Friday. This movement reflects a slight upward trend, but technical analysis suggests a weakening bullish sentiment, with the currency pair remaining just beneath the lower boundary of its established ascending channel pattern.

Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate as it holds above the nine-day EMA near 1.3450. A sustained position above this level may indicate potential support, although the recent price action raises questions about the durability of the current bullish bias. Traders will be watching for further developments that could impact the GBP against the USD in the coming days.

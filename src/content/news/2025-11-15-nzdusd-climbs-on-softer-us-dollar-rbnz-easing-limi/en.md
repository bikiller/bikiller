NZD/USD is trading higher around 0.5680 on Friday, reflecting a 0.60% increase for the day. This upward movement is primarily driven by a softer US Dollar as investors adopt a cautious stance ahead of key US macroeconomic data releases, which have been postponed due to the recent government shutdown. The exchange rate shift indicates a potential shift in market sentiment amid ongoing uncertainty.

However, the rebound of the Kiwi is tempered by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) easing policies, which continue to weigh on the New Zealand dollar. As traders monitor both domestic and international economic indicators, the NZD/USD pair's performance will remain closely linked to developments in US economic data and the RBNZ's monetary policy stance in the coming weeks.

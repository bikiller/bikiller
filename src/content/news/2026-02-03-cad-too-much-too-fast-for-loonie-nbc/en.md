The Canadian Dollar (CAD) kicked off 2026 at its strongest level against the USD since 2024, with the exchange rate hitting impressive levels. This surge was fueled by rising commodity prices, particularly oil, which boosted Canada's resource-driven economy. As a result, the CAD saw significant appreciation against the USD, reaching a key resistance level.

This rally also reflected a shift in speculative positioning. Traders, who had been shorting the loonie, reversed their bets, contributing further to the CAD's strength. The currency pair’s momentum is being watched closely, with analysts predicting potential resistance around the 1.33 level against the USD. As the market adjusts to the changing dynamics, traders will be looking for signs of whether the loonie can maintain its recent gains or if a correction is due.

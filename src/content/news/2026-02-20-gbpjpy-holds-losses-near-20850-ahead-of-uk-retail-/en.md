GBP/JPY has extended its losses for the second consecutive session, with the currency pair trading near 208.60 during the Asian trading session on Friday. The exchange rate has been pressured by market anticipation ahead of key economic data from the UK, including retail sales and PMI figures. A potential downturn in these indicators could heighten concerns over the UK’s economic recovery, adding to the currency pair's volatility.

Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming UK data, as weaker-than-expected results could trigger further declines in GBP/JPY. The pair has already shown signs of weakening, hovering around the 208.50 level, which may act as an important technical support. With the broader market also sensitive to fluctuations in global risk sentiment and USD movements, the short-term outlook for GBP/JPY remains uncertain.

Commerzbank's Thu Lan Nguyen warns that the unusually low gas storage levels in Germany and the EU, coupled with rising consumption, could trigger significant price increases. The flattened forward curve suggests that future gas prices may be highly volatile, increasing the likelihood of sudden spikes. This could impact the EUR/USD exchange rate, as concerns over energy shortages may weigh on the euro, especially against the USD.

As gas storage risks grow, the potential for consumption restrictions also increases, further complicating the energy landscape. With EUR/USD trading at a critical technical level, these energy concerns could add pressure on the euro, leading to more volatility in forex markets. Traders may need to adjust their strategies, factoring in the likelihood of heightened price instability and its impact on broader European economic performance.

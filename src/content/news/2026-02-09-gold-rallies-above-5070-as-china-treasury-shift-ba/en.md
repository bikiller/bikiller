Gold surged above $5,070 during the North American trading session on Monday, with the XAU/USD pair gaining 2.16%. The rally comes amid reports that Chinese authorities have advised institutions to reduce their exposure to U.S. Treasuries, citing concerns over heightened volatility in the bond market. This shift in China’s treasury holdings has weighed on the USD, further boosting demand for the precious metal.

As of writing, XAU/USD is trading at $5.074, showing solid gains. The move has reinforced gold’s position as a safe haven asset, with investors seeking shelter from the uncertainty surrounding U.S. Treasury markets. The US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure, with implications for currency pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD as the greenback faces challenges due to global economic developments.

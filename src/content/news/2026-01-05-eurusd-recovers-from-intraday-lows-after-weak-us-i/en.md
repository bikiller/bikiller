The Euro (EUR) staged a recovery against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, bouncing back from earlier losses following disappointing US ISM Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data. As the market adjusted to the weaker-than-expected economic indicators, the EUR/USD currency pair climbed to approximately 1.1706, recovering from an intraday low of around 1.1659.

The decline in the ISM PMI exerted downward pressure on the Greenback, prompting traders to reassess their positions in favor of the Euro. This movement highlights the ongoing sensitivity of the exchange rate to economic data releases, as market participants remain vigilant for further signals about the health of the US economy.

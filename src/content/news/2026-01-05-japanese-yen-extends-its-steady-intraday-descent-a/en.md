The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued its steady decline against a robust US Dollar (USD) for the fourth consecutive day, dropping to a nearly two-week low during the Asian trading session on Monday. The currency pair USD/JPY reflects this trend, with the exchange rate showing increased strength for the USD as market sentiment leans towards dollar-denominated assets.

Analysts attribute the Yen's weakness to a combination of factors, including rising US Treasury yields and persistent inflation concerns in the United States. As traders anticipate potential interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, the demand for the USD has grown, putting additional pressure on the JPY. With the current exchange rate hovering near critical support levels, further movement in the USD/JPY pair may signal broader implications for global currency trends.

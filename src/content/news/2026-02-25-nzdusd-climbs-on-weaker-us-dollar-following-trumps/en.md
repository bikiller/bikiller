NZD/USD extended its gains on Wednesday, trading around 0.5980, up 0.27% for the day. The pair has seen a rebound for the second consecutive session, benefitting from a weaker US Dollar following President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address. The speech left markets speculating on potential policy shifts, contributing to a subdued USD performance across major pairs.

The decline in USD strength provided support for the New Zealand Dollar, allowing NZD/USD to hold above the key 0.5950 level. As the US Dollar weakens, investors are eyeing further movement in the pair, with 0.6000 acting as a potential resistance. The weaker USD also provided an opportunity for other major currencies like the EUR to make gains, adding to the broader shift in forex markets.

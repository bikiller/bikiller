Gold's recent consolidation following a strong January rally has not dampened its upward momentum, according to ING's Commodities Strategist, Ewa Manthey. Despite the pause in price action, Manthey suggests that structural support remains intact, keeping the gold rally on track. With XAU/USD still holding key levels, the precious metal continues to benefit from a softening USD and ongoing global uncertainties.

Gold's price has maintained stability above significant support zones, with technical indicators showing resilience. As the EUR/USD exchange rate strengthens and the US Dollar weakens, gold has attracted renewed interest from traders. The technical outlook remains bullish, particularly if XAU/USD sustains its position above the $1,850 mark. The focus will be on any shifts in USD sentiment, which could fuel further gains in the yellow metal.

The EUR/USD currency pair continues to trade with a positive bias, holding above the key 1.1800 level as the US Dollar faces downward pressure. On Thursday, the pair extends its modest gains from the previous day, attracting buyers despite the lack of strong bullish momentum. The exchange rate fluctuates around the 1.1815-1.1820 region during the Asian session, showing a modest 0.10% gain for the day.

The softening USD is driving the recent movement in the EUR/USD pair, with traders reacting to trade jitters and risk sentiment. Although the pair is unable to gain significant ground, it remains supported above the 1.1800 level, indicating potential for further consolidation. As the market continues to assess the USD's outlook, EUR/USD’s technical levels around 1.1820 will be crucial for the next directional move.

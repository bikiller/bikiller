The UK employment data for the three months ending December will be released today at 07:00 GMT. The report could have significant implications for the GBP/USD exchange rate, which is currently hovering near key technical levels. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could push the British pound higher, potentially testing resistance levels around 1.2450, while weaker data might prompt a dip toward support near 1.2300.

Market participants will closely watch the unemployment rate, job vacancies, and average earnings, as these indicators can offer insights into inflationary pressures and the strength of the UK economy. A positive outcome may lead to increased speculation about the Bank of England raising interest rates, which typically boosts the pound. On the other hand, disappointing numbers could fuel concerns about economic weakness and further limit the GBP/USD’s upside potential.

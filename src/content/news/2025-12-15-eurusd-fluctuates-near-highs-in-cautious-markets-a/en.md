EUR/USD is currently trading around 1.1730, showing moderate losses but remaining close to the multi-month high of 1.1762. The currency pair's fluctuations are indicative of a cautious market atmosphere as traders brace for a busy economic week ahead. Delayed US macroeconomic data releases and the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy decision are contributing to the cautious sentiment.

As investors navigate these developments, the exchange rate will likely be influenced by the impending economic indicators from the US and the ECB's policy stance. The market's reaction to these events will be critical in determining whether the EUR/USD can break through the key resistance level at 1.1762 or if it will retreat further amid uncertainty in the economic landscape.

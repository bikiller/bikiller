Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a decline as it pulls back from its recent record high of nearly $4,900. During the Asian session on Thursday, the precious metal moved lower, driven by diminishing safe-haven demand amid easing concerns over the trade war. This shift reflects a broader market sentiment as investors shift focus away from gold towards other assets.

As trade tensions subside, the exchange rate for gold is expected to remain under pressure. Market participants are closely monitoring developments that could further influence the USD and EUR, impacting overall trading dynamics. The retreat from the all-time peak suggests a potential recalibration of investor strategies, highlighting the intricate interplay between geopolitical factors and currency movements in the forex market.

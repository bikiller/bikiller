The Japanese Yen (JPY) has fallen to a one-week low against the US Dollar (USD), trading at 145.60, as a positive risk sentiment grips the market ahead of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) upcoming policy meeting. Investors are increasingly concerned about Japan's fiscal health, which has compounded the Yen's decline amid a broader trend of currency trading favoring riskier assets.

As the USD strengthens, the exchange rate for the EUR/JPY has also come under pressure, reflecting a shift in market dynamics. The current risk-on mood is driving traders to favor currencies like the USD, causing JPY to struggle in a climate where fiscal uncertainties loom large. The focus remains on the BoJ’s policy decisions, which could further impact trading strategies and the overall currency pair movement in the near term.

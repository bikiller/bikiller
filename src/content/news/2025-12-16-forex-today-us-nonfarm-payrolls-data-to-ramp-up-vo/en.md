Volatility is set to increase in the forex market as traders prepare for the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls data. As of Tuesday, December 16, the USD is trading at 1.1300 against the EUR, reflecting a cautious sentiment ahead of the crucial employment figures. Market analysts are closely watching this currency pair, anticipating potential fluctuations based on the data's implications for Federal Reserve policy.

The exchange rate of USD/JPY is also under scrutiny, currently hovering around 104.50. A strong Nonfarm Payrolls report could bolster the greenback, pushing the pair higher, while a disappointing outcome may lead to a reversal. Traders are positioning themselves for significant moves, with technical levels suggesting resistance at 105.00 and support at 104.00. The market's reaction to the data will likely shape trading strategies in the coming days.

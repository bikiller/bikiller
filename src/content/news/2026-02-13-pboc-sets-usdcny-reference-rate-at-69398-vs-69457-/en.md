The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the USD/CNY reference rate at 6.9398 for Friday's trading session, slightly weaker than the previous day's fix of 6.9457. This adjustment reflects a minor shift in the yuan's value against the US dollar, with the central bank aiming to manage currency stability amid global economic factors.

This move comes as the market watches closely for further signs of intervention by the PBOC, particularly in response to fluctuations in the US dollar and broader market trends. The change, though small, could influence the USD/CNY exchange rate throughout the trading day, with traders adjusting positions in anticipation of any further policy shifts.

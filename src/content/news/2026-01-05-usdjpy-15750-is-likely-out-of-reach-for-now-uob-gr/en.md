The USD/JPY exchange rate has shown signs of increased momentum, though analysts at UOB Group suggest that the 157.50 threshold is unlikely to be reached in the near term. The current market dynamics indicate a potential for further advancement of the US Dollar, which may face mild upward pressure over the longer horizon.

Despite the immediate resistance, the USD could gradually drift higher, creating the possibility of testing the 157.50 level in the coming weeks. Market participants should remain vigilant, as any significant moves in this currency pair could have broader implications for trading strategies and market sentiment surrounding the USD and other major currencies.

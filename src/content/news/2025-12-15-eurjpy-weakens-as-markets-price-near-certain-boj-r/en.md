The Euro (EUR) is under pressure against the Japanese Yen (JPY) as it trades lower amid a strengthening Yen. Currently, the EUR/JPY exchange rate reflects this shift, with markets anticipating a near-certain interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) at its December 19 policy meeting. This expectation has led to increased buying of JPY, pushing the currency pair downward.

As traders adjust their positions ahead of the BoJ's decision, the implications for the EUR/JPY could be significant. A rate hike would not only bolster the Yen but could also prompt shifts in USD and EUR dynamics, further affecting the wider forex market. The current market sentiment underscores the importance of central bank policies in shaping currency valuations and trading strategies.

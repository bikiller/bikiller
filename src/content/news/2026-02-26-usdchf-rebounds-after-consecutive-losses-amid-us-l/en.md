USD/CHF is trading around 0.7740 on Thursday, up 0.15% for the day, following a series of consecutive losses. The currency pair is seeing some relief from the US Dollar's modest rebound, which has supported the exchange rate. However, broader market sentiment remains largely risk-averse, with strong demand for safe-haven assets like the Swiss Franc.

Despite the uptick in USD/CHF, the underlying trend suggests that the US Dollar's recovery is tempered by ongoing concerns around global uncertainty. The demand for safe-haven currencies continues to drive flows into the Swiss Franc, limiting further gains for the greenback. As market participants react to US labor data, the near-term outlook for the pair remains cautious, with volatility likely to persist.

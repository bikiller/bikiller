The US Dollar (USD) fell to a five-week low, closing the week at approximately 97.80. The decline comes amid growing risk aversion in financial markets, with traders adjusting their positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decision. This weakness in the USD also weighed on major currency pairs, including the EUR/USD, which saw upward movement as the greenback softened.

As market participants prepare for the Fed's next move, uncertainty surrounding interest rates and economic outlooks continues to dominate sentiment. The USD’s slide reflects cautious optimism in global markets, where investors are positioning themselves for potential changes in the monetary policy landscape. With the Fed's decision looming, volatility in the forex market is expected to remain elevated, keeping traders on alert for further moves in the USD’s exchange rate.

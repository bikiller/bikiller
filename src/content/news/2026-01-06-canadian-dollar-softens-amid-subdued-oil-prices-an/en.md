The Canadian Dollar (CAD) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, as the USD/CAD currency pair exhibited an upward trend. This movement comes amid a firm US Dollar, despite the Federal Reserve's cautious stance and disappointing US S&P Global Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data, which reflected a slowing economy. The exchange rate dynamics indicate that trader sentiment remains skewed towards the Greenback.

Subdued oil prices have further pressured the CAD, which is closely linked to oil market performance. With ongoing fluctuations in crude prices, the Canadian Dollar's resilience is tested. As traders assess the implications of economic indicators and central bank commentary, the USD's strength continues to dominate the market landscape, suggesting a challenging environment for the CAD moving forward.

GBP/USD is under pressure as it navigates around the 1.3200 level during early European trading on Tuesday. This comes after a notable retreat from recent highs of 1.3276, which marked a five-week peak. The currency pair's struggles are largely attributed to resistance posed by the 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), keeping the pound sterling in check against the USD.

Market dynamics indicate that traders are closely monitoring this exchange rate as it consolidates its losses. The inability of GBP/USD to hold above the 1.3200 mark raises concerns about further declines if the pair fails to reclaim momentum. As sentiment shifts, the interplay between the pound and the US dollar will be pivotal in setting the tone for future trading sessions.

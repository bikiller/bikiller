The USD/JPY currency pair has experienced a decline, currently trading around 155.10 in the early Asian session on Tuesday. This pullback comes as the Japanese Yen strengthens against the US Dollar, driven by growing speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is poised to raise interest rates at its policy meeting this Friday.

Market participants are closely monitoring the situation as expectations of a BoJ rate hike could significantly impact the exchange rate. The anticipation of higher rates in Japan contrasts with the current US economic data, which traders await for further direction. The evolving landscape suggests volatility ahead for the USD/JPY pair, as traders position themselves in response to both local and international monetary policy shifts.

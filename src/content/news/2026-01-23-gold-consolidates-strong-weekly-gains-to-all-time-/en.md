Gold (XAU/USD) is maintaining its strong bullish momentum, consolidating near its all-time high of $4,950 as it heads into the European session. Despite a shift in US political sentiment regarding Greenland, the precious metal remains well-supported, reflecting a sustained demand for safe-haven assets. The easing of geopolitical tensions has had a muted impact on gold's price action, with traders continuing to focus on broader market sentiment and inflation concerns.

As the price stabilizes around this record level, the outlook for XAU/USD remains bullish, with potential for further gains in the near term. The strength of gold is supported by a weaker USD and persistent market uncertainties, keeping investor appetite high for precious metals. With the technical levels now set at $4,950, any pullbacks may offer buying opportunities for those looking to capitalize on gold's ongoing bullish potential.

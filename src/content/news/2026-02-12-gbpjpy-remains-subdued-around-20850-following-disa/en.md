GBP/JPY continued to struggle in the negative zone, trading around 208.60 early on Thursday, after briefly recovering from its earlier losses. The currency pair’s subdued performance comes in the wake of disappointing UK GDP data, which failed to meet market expectations. As a result, the exchange rate of GBP/JPY remains under pressure, with little upside momentum despite attempts to pare losses.

The weak UK GDP figures have left investors cautious, with the British pound struggling to gain traction against the yen. This development highlights the ongoing challenges in the UK economy, influencing sentiment and contributing to the pair's lackluster trading. With GBP/JPY lingering around 208.50, traders are likely to watch for further economic data or shifts in market sentiment to gauge the next direction for the pair.

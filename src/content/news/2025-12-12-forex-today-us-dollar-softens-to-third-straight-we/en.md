The US Dollar experienced a third consecutive weekly decline as traders reevaluated the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook. The DXY index fell to 102.50, reflecting a 0.5% drop. Against the Euro, the USD exchanged at 1.09, showing signs of weakness as market sentiment leaned toward a more dovish Fed stance amid concerns over economic growth.

In contrast, the EUR/USD currency pair saw bullish momentum, with the exchange rate climbing 0.3% over the week. Analysts suggest this trend may continue as investors anticipate a potential slowdown in interest rate hikes. The implications for trading strategies are significant, as traders may position themselves for continued volatility in the USD, while favoring currencies that could benefit from a shift in the Fed's approach.

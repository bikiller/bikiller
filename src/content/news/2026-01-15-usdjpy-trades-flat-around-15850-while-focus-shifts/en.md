The USD/JPY currency pair is trading flat around the 158.50 mark during the European session on Thursday. This range-bound movement comes as traders remain vigilant ahead of Japan's upcoming elections, which could influence market sentiment and exchange rates. Notably, the pair is hovering near its yearly high of 159.45 achieved just the day before, indicating strong resistance levels.

As market participants assess the potential implications of the election results, volatility in the USD/JPY exchange rate could increase. A decisive outcome may lead to shifts in economic policy, impacting the yen's strength against the dollar. Traders are poised to react to any developments, making this a critical period for the currency pair as it approaches significant technical levels.

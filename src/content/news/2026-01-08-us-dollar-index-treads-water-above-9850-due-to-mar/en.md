The US Dollar Index (DXY) remains steady above the 98.50 level, trading at approximately 98.70 during Thursday's Asian session. This stability follows two consecutive days of gains, as traders exercise caution in the currency markets. The index, which gauges the USD against six major currencies, reflects a balanced sentiment amidst geopolitical uncertainties.

Market participants are closely monitoring the performance of key currency pairs, including the EUR/USD and GBP/USD, to gauge potential shifts in exchange rates. The USD's resilience indicates a careful approach, with traders assessing the implications of upcoming economic data releases that could impact the dollar's trajectory. As the market navigates these dynamics, the DXY's position above 98.50 may serve as a critical threshold for future trading decisions.

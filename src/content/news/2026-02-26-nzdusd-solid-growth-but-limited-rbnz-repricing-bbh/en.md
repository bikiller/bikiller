NZD/USD remains under pressure, struggling to hold above the key 0.6000 level despite a solid recovery signal from New Zealand's ANZ business survey. The survey points to robust GDP growth, indicating a strengthening economy. However, the New Zealand dollar is facing headwinds as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to adopt a cautious stance. The RBNZ's focus on spare capacity and a negative output gap means no immediate repricing of policy is likely.

Despite the positive economic data, the NZD/USD pair is weighed down by broader market conditions. The exchange rate remains sensitive to external factors, including global risk sentiment and the performance of the USD. While New Zealand's recovery is evident, the RBNZ's reluctance to tighten policy means that the Kiwi dollar may struggle to make significant gains in the near term. As traders monitor the central bank’s actions, NZD/USD may face challenges in breaking above the 0.6000 threshold.

Dow Jones futures slipped by 0.43%, hovering around 49,450 during European hours, as risk aversion intensified. The decline came amid growing concerns over tariffs and geopolitical tensions, which weighed on investor sentiment ahead of the US market open. Meanwhile, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.58% and 0.74%, respectively, trading at 6,880 and 24,880.

These market movements were mirrored in the forex space, with the USD experiencing downward pressure against key currency pairs. The EUR/USD exchange rate saw modest fluctuations as traders reacted to the risk-off sentiment. With the looming uncertainties surrounding global trade and political developments, markets are bracing for more volatility, leaving traders cautious as they await further clarity on the broader economic outlook.

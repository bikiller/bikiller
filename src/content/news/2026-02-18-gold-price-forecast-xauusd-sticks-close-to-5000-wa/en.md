Gold prices saw a strong rebound on Wednesday after experiencing a sharp decline of over 2% in the previous session. The XAU/USD pair stayed near the significant $5,000 mark, with traders adjusting their positions ahead of the release of the FOMC Minutes later in the day. The rebound was a result of cautious optimism as investors anticipated key insights into the Fed's upcoming policy moves.

As the Federal Reserve’s stance continues to influence the market, the gold price’s recovery signals potential volatility ahead. The exchange rate of XAU/USD remained volatile, with market participants eyeing the clues that the FOMC Minutes may provide about future interest rate decisions. Traders remain on edge, balancing their positions between safe-haven assets like gold and the strength of the USD, with implications for broader forex markets, particularly EUR/USD.

The USD/CHF currency pair continued its downward trend, declining 0.60% on Tuesday and reaching an October 17 low of approximately 0.7873. This slide reflects growing expectations for easing monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, which has pressured the US Dollar in recent trading sessions.

As the market digests the potential for a dovish shift from the Fed, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) maintained its steady stance, contributing to the exchange rate's fluctuations. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as the interplay between US monetary policy and Switzerland's economic outlook will play a crucial role in determining the future trajectory of the USD/CHF pair.

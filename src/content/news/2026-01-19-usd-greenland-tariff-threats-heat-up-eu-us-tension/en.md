This geopolitical move has stirred concerns among traders, particularly affecting the EUR/USD currency pair, which is currently experiencing heightened volatility as the exchange rate reacts to the shifting landscape.

In response, France has advocated for the EU to implement anti-coercion measures, signaling a potential counteraction to U.S. tariffs. This development could influence trading strategies in the forex market, as investors closely monitor the implications for the USD.

GBP/USD surged to ten-week highs on Monday, buoyed by a notable decline in the US dollar as traders prepared for a holiday-shortened trading week. The currency pair experienced a fresh wave of Greenback weakness, allowing the Pound Sterling to capitalize and push the exchange rate upward. As market participants positioned themselves ahead of the holidays, the rally in GBP/USD reflected a broader sentiment shift in favor of the UK currency.

The ongoing dynamics in forex trading suggest that the recent gains in GBP/USD could indicate a potential reversal of trends. With the exchange rate now flirting with significant resistance levels, the market will closely watch for any economic data releases or geopolitical developments that could impact the USD's strength. As the holidays approach, liquidity may decrease, making the currency pair's movements even more pronounced.

NZD/USD is trading around 0.5950 on Tuesday, slipping 0.14% for the day. The currency pair struggled to maintain momentum above the key 0.6000 level, pressured by a stronger US Dollar. The recent movement reflects growing market concerns over signals from the Federal Reserve and rising trade tensions.

The US Dollar's strength is driven by expectations of continued tightening from the Fed, which has supported USD across various currency pairs.

This situation highlights the broader market uncertainty, with global trade concerns further weighing on risk-sensitive currencies like the NZD.

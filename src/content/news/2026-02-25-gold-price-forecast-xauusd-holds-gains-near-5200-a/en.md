Gold (XAU/USD) is trading 0.6% higher, hovering around $5,200 during the European session on Wednesday. The price surge comes amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran, which have sparked concerns over global stability. Investors are seeking safe-haven assets like gold as geopolitical risks weigh heavily on market sentiment. 

Trade uncertainty is also contributing to the bullish move in gold, with traders nervous about the potential impact on global markets. The US Dollar (USD) has faced downward pressure, further boosting the appeal of gold. As a result, XAU/USD is holding onto its gains, with market participants closely monitoring developments in US-Iran relations and trade negotiations.

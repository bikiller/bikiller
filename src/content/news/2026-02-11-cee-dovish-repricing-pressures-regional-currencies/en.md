Central and Eastern European (CEE) currencies are facing downward pressure as dovish rate expectations dominate the markets. Frantisek Taborsky from ING highlights that anticipation of soft inflation and GDP data has prompted a shift in sentiment. As traders reassess the economic outlook, the Czech koruna (CZK), Polish zloty (PLN), and Hungarian forint (HUF) have all seen declines against the USD and EUR. The EUR/USD exchange rate remains a key focal point, with analysts watching closely for any signs of further easing expectations in the region.

The dovish outlook has had a clear impact on regional currency pairs, with the forint falling to its lowest levels in weeks against the euro. As markets position themselves ahead of upcoming inflation reports, the exchange rate for EUR/HUF continues to be a critical level for traders to watch. As economic indicators remain in focus, further weakness in CEE currencies could create continued volatility, especially as global risk sentiment fluctuates. The USD also remains strong, maintaining its dominance in the forex market.

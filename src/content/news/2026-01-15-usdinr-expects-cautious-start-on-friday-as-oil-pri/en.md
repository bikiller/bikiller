The USD/INR currency pair closed Wednesday's session with modest gains, trading at approximately 90.55. As traders look ahead to Friday's market opening, sentiment remains cautious, particularly as oil prices have shown signs of cooling down. This could influence the exchange rate of the Indian Rupee against the U.S. Dollar, impacting trading strategies moving forward.

On Thursday, the Indian financial markets were closed due to the Mumbai Municipal elections, which may contribute to reduced volatility and lower trading volumes. As the markets reopen, investors will be closely monitoring global oil price movements and their potential effects on inflation and the Indian economy. The interplay between these factors will be critical in determining the USD/INR exchange rate in the coming sessions.

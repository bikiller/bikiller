Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to approximately $4,440 during the early Asian session on Tuesday, marking a one-week high as traders flocked to safe-haven assets. The escalating crisis in Venezuela has contributed to heightened geopolitical uncertainty, driving demand for gold as a protective measure against market volatility.

As the exchange rate for gold continues to climb, the implications of such price movements could ripple through the broader forex market. Investors are closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela, which may influence currency pairs involving the USD and EUR as traders assess the impact of geopolitical tensions on global economic stability. The ongoing rally underscores gold's role as a hedge in times of crisis.

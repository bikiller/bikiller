Heightened political tensions surrounding the independence of the Federal Reserve have unsettled financial markets, leading to notable declines in the US Dollar (USD) and long-term Treasuries. The USD faced downward pressure, impacting key currency pairs such as EUR/USD, which moved closer to 1.05. Meanwhile, US equity futures also fell, amidst concerns over potential interference in monetary policy.

Amid this turmoil, gold prices surged to new record highs, reflecting a flight to safety as investors sought refuge from the volatility. The implications of this shift could weigh heavily on future trading strategies, as traders reassess their positions in light of the evolving political landscape and its potential influence on exchange rates and overall market stability.

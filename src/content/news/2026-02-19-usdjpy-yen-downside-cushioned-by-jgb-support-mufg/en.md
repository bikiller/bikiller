The Japanese Yen's downside remains limited despite rising geopolitical risks, with the USD/JPY exchange rate continuing its ascent. According to MUFG's Derek Halpenny, the Yen could face further weakness if global tensions escalate, as USD/JPY has already surged from last week’s low. The current support from Japan's Government Bond (JGB) market provides some cushioning, limiting the Yen's further depreciation.

As USD/JPY pushes higher, the trading momentum has been clear, with the pair benefiting from robust USD demand. The exchange rate’s recent move above key resistance levels highlights the market's preference for the dollar amid global uncertainties. However, the JGB market's role in stabilizing the Yen remains a critical factor for traders monitoring potential shifts in the broader currency landscape.

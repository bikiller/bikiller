Gold (XAU/USD) saw a notable rise on Friday, holding above the $5,000 mark as geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran fueled demand for safe-haven assets. With global uncertainty mounting, investors sought the stability of gold, driving the price higher. The precious metal's ability to stay above this significant threshold reflects growing concerns over the conflict, amplifying its appeal as a store of value.

The ongoing US-Iran tensions coincided with a firm Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report, which added pressure to the USD. As the dollar struggles, gold continues to benefit from its status as an alternative investment. The combination of geopolitical risk and inflationary concerns is likely to sustain gold's momentum, keeping it above key technical levels as markets watch for further developments in the US-Iran standoff.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) continues to struggle, primarily due to rising uncertainties surrounding the US economy and increased interventionist policies. As a result, the CAD has emerged as the weakest currency among the G10, further affecting its exchange rates against major pairs. Current market dynamics show the USD/CAD trading at elevated levels, reflecting a growing divergence in economic sentiment.

Market analysts point to the renewed focus on US risks, which are weighing heavily on the CAD's performance. The currency is now closely watched as it navigates through these turbulent waters, with the USD strengthening against it. Traders are advised to keep an eye on technical levels, as fluctuations in the CAD could lead to significant trading opportunities across various currency pairs.

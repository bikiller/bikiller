NZD/USD is trading around 0.5780 on Monday, reflecting a 0.50% increase for the day. The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) gained traction as positive economic data from China, New Zealand's primary trading partner, bolstered the currency's appeal. Investors responded favorably to the encouraging figures, which provided a much-needed boost to the NZD amid ongoing concerns regarding U.S. tariffs.

Despite the rebound, uncertainties surrounding potential tariffs imposed by former President Trump continue to loom over the market. These fears are likely to weigh on the USD and create volatility in the currency pair. As traders monitor developments in both the U.S. and China, the NZD may experience fluctuations, reflecting the broader implications of trade dynamics on exchange rates.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) fell to $71.90 during the Asian trading session on Friday, marking the lowest level since January 2. The decline comes as geopolitical tensions ease, leading to reduced demand for safe-haven assets like silver. The metal has also been pressured by profit-taking, with traders scaling back positions after recent gains.

Market participants are turning their attention to the upcoming US-Iran talks later today, which could influence silver's movement. A potential de-escalation of tensions between the two countries may further diminish silver's appeal as a hedge. As silver continues its downward trajectory, traders will watch closely for any shifts in sentiment or new developments that could affect the XAG/USD exchange rate.

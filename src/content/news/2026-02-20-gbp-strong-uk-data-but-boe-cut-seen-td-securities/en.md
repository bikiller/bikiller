GBP surged following a strong 1.8% monthly rise in UK Retail Sales, surpassing expectations. This solid data, combined with stronger-than-anticipated PMIs, fueled optimism as the UK economy showed signs of resilience. Analysts pointed to broad-based demand and a boost in export orders, which contributed to the upbeat sentiment surrounding the pound.

However, TD Securities suggests that despite this positive data, the Bank of England (BoE) is likely to implement a rate cut. This shift in monetary policy expectations could weigh on GBP in the near term. As a result, the GBP/USD exchange rate saw some volatility, with traders adjusting their positions in anticipation of the BoE's actions. The broader outlook for the pound remains influenced by the balance between strong economic data and the central bank's policy stance.

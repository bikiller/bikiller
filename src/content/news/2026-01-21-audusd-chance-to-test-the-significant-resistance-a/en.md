The Australian Dollar (AUD) is poised to trade within a range of 0.6700 to 0.6745 against the US Dollar (USD), according to UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This sideways movement reflects current market conditions as traders navigate volatility in the broader forex landscape. 

Looking ahead, the analysts highlight a potential upward test of the significant resistance level at 0.6765. A breakthrough at this threshold could signal stronger bullish momentum for the AUD, impacting its exchange rate dynamics with other major currencies such as the Euro (EUR). Traders should closely monitor this currency pair for potential trading opportunities as market sentiment evolves.

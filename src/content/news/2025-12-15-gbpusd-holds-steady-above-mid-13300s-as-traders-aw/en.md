The GBP/USD currency pair is holding steady above the pivotal 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) during the Asian session on Monday, trading around the 1.3360 mark. Despite a generally defensive stance, the pair is showing a lack of bearish momentum, indicating traders are awaiting key economic data and the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) announcements later this week.

As market participants focus on these critical events, the exchange rate reflects a cautious attitude, with prices remaining relatively unchanged for the day. The stability above the mid-1.3300s suggests a potential for upward movement, but traders are likely to remain vigilant as they anticipate further developments that could influence the GBP's strength against the USD.

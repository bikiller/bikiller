The Bank of England's unexpected dovish stance has sent shockwaves through the forex markets, shifting sentiment toward a potential rate cut. The GBP/USD exchange rate reacted swiftly, falling sharply as traders adjusted their positions. With expectations of easing, the pair dropped below the 1.2300 mark, a significant shift from its prior stability. The central bank’s more cautious tone has led to recalibrated forecasts, now focusing on future cuts rather than hikes.

EUR/GBP also saw notable movement, rising against the weakened pound. The single currency strengthened, pushing the pair to fresh highs. ING's Chris Turner noted that the dovish outlook from the BoE has created a new dynamic in the market, with the prospect of lower rates putting downward pressure on the British pound. This shift has forced traders to reassess their positions, with the USD also seeing renewed strength as a result of these changes.

AUD/USD is trading around 0.6550 on Tuesday, reflecting a modest gain of 0.20% for the day. The currency pair is benefiting from a favorable risk sentiment in the market, as traders react to increasing expectations for further monetary easing from the Federal Reserve. This outlook is putting downward pressure on the US Dollar (USD), enhancing the appeal of the Australian Dollar (AUD).

As focus shifts to upcoming Australian GDP data, the exchange rate of AUD/USD remains sensitive to shifts in risk appetite and economic indicators. The current market environment suggests that any indications of a Fed rate cut could further weaken the USD, potentially driving the AUD/USD pair higher. Traders are closely monitoring geopolitical developments and economic performance to gauge future trends in this currency pair.

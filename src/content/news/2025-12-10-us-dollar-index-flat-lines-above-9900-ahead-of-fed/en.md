The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading flat around 99.20 during Asian hours on Wednesday, maintaining its position above the key psychological level of 99.00. This stability comes as traders await the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decision, which is expected to significantly influence the dollar's trajectory.

As market participants closely monitor the Fed's announcement, the exchange rate of USD against major currencies, including EUR and JPY, remains cautious. The indecisiveness in the DXY reflects broader market uncertainty, with traders weighing the implications of potential interest rate changes and their impact on currency pairs moving forward.

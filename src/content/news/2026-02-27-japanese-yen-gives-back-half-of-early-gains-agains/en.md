The Japanese Yen (JPY) retraced half of its early gains against the US Dollar (USD) in Friday's European trading session. The USD/JPY currency pair rebounded to around 155.90, erasing much of the Yen's initial strength. Despite the pullback, the Yen remains 0.15% lower on the day, reflecting the ongoing volatility in the pair.

The shift in momentum comes ahead of the release of key US Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which is expected to provide fresh direction for USD/JPY. Market participants are closely watching the data, as it could impact expectations for US inflation and monetary policy, influencing the exchange rate in the coming days.

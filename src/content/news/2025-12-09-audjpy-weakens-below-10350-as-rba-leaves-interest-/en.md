The AUD/JPY currency pair has weakened, trading below the 103.50 level as it dips to around 103.20 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This decline follows the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) decision to maintain the interest rate at 3.6%, causing the Australian Dollar (AUD) to lose ground against the US Dollar (USD) and other major currencies.

As traders reacted to the RBA's announcement, the Australian Dollar faced downward pressure, impacting its exchange rate with the Japanese Yen (JPY). This movement reflects broader market sentiment as investors weigh interest rate policies and their implications for future economic growth. The current weakness in AUD/JPY underscores the challenges the Australian currency faces in the wake of the RBA's decision.

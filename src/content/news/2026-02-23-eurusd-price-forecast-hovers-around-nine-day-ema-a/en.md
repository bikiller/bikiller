EUR/USD continued its upward momentum for a second consecutive session, trading near 1.1820 during the Asian hours on Monday. The currency pair has been supported by a stabilization in market sentiment, with the euro gaining ground against the USD. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 51, reflecting neutral conditions after bouncing back above the 50 midline, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers.

The exchange rate's movement above the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) suggests a potential for further consolidation above the 1.1800 mark. While the EUR/USD pair shows signs of stability, momentum remains cautious, and the RSI indicates no clear direction. Market participants will be watching for any shifts in economic data or central bank signals that may provide further guidance on the next trend for this key currency pair.

GBP/USD slipped below the 1.3500 mark as investor sentiment was dampened by growing expectations of a Bank of England (BoE) rate cut. The currency pair, which had seen a modest rally over the past two days, was trading around 1.3480 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This shift in momentum comes as market participants reassess the outlook for UK monetary policy.

The decline in GBP/USD is attributed to a rebound in the US Dollar (USD), which has recovered from losses suffered over the previous two sessions. With the USD gaining strength, the pair is under pressure, reflecting broader market concerns regarding global economic conditions. As the BoE’s rate cut bets weigh on the pound, traders are closely monitoring the evolving dynamics between the GBP and USD.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) saw continued gains against its major counterparts on Wednesday, driven by anticipation ahead of the Bank of England's (BoE) monetary policy decision on Thursday. The GBP/USD exchange rate surged to 1.2260, reflecting a 0.5% increase, while GBP/EUR reached 1.1440, up 0.4% on the day. With market sentiment leaning toward a rate pause by the BoE, investors are closely monitoring any signals regarding future policy direction.

This upward movement in GBP is attributed to a mix of positive sentiment surrounding the BoE's cautious stance and an overall weaker US Dollar (USD). The potential for the central bank to maintain its current interest rate level has spurred demand for the Pound, as investors bet on stability in the UK economy. A hold on rates is expected to further support GBP in the near term, with technical levels now watching 1.2300 as the next key resistance against USD.

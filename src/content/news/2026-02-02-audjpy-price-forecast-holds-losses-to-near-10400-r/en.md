The AUD/JPY currency pair has been under pressure, holding its losses just above the 104.00 mark as it faced selling near 104.05 during early European trading on Monday. The Japanese Yen strengthened following the release of the Bank of Japan’s Summary of Opinions from the January 22-23 meeting, which pointed to increased hawkish sentiment within the central bank. This shift in tone has added support to the yen against the Australian Dollar.

Traders are now awaiting the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) rate decision, which is likely to impact the AUD further. The potential for any signals of tightening from the RBA could alter the current dynamic in the AUD/JPY exchange rate, which has been influenced by broader market sentiment and ongoing central bank policy shifts. As such, any surprises in the upcoming RBA announcement may spark volatility for the currency pair.

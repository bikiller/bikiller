The USD/CHF currency pair is currently consolidating around the exchange rate of 0.7950 as traders exercise caution ahead of the upcoming US inflation data for November. This data, set to be released at 13:30 GMT, is expected to provide insight into the US economic outlook and could influence future Federal Reserve policy decisions.

During the late Asian trading session, the Swiss Franc has shown volatility as market participants weigh the potential implications of the inflation figures. A stronger-than-expected inflation reading could bolster the US dollar, while weaker data might lead to a dip in the currency pair's value. As traders remain on edge, all eyes will be on the inflation report for clues on the direction of the USD/CHF in the coming sessions.

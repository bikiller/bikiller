The AUD/USD currency pair is experiencing a slight decline, trading 0.22% lower near the 0.6980 level during the European session on Thursday. This pullback comes despite the recent support from the ascending 20-day exponential moving average (EMA), which has been backing a bullish outlook for the pair. Market participants are eyeing potential price recovery as the Australian Dollar remains supported by ongoing risk appetite.

The U.S. Dollar (USD) continues to dominate market sentiment, with traders cautious ahead of upcoming economic data releases. The USD's strength is exerting downward pressure on the AUD/USD exchange rate, limiting any upward movement. As the market assesses economic fundamentals, the 0.7000 resistance level remains a key point of interest for traders, potentially guiding the next directional move for this currency pair.

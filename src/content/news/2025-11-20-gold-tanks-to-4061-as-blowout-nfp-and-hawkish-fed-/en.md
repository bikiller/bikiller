Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a significant decline during the North American session, trading at $4,061, down 0.38%. This drop follows the release of the September US jobs report, which exceeded expectations and signaled a robust labor market. The strong data prompted traders to exit safe-haven assets, spurred by concerns that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more hawkish stance in upcoming monetary policy decisions.

The positive employment figures have bolstered the USD's strength, impacting the exchange rate dynamics across the forex market. As investors pivot towards riskier assets, the retreat in gold prices reflects a growing confidence in economic recovery. Market participants will be closely monitoring further economic indicators and the Fed's response to these developments, as they may influence the trading landscape for both gold and the broader currency pairs in the coming weeks.

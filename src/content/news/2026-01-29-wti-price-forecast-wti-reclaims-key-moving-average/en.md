WTI Crude Oil prices surged to a four-month high on Thursday, driven by heightened geopolitical risks amid escalating tensions between the US and Iran. The price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) rose as much as 3.2%, climbing to $82.50 per barrel. This rally has been supported by a growing risk premium, fueling market optimism and driving oil prices higher.

Technical indicators also played a role in the recent rally, with WTI reclaiming key moving averages, further bolstering the bullish outlook. The recovery in oil prices has provided support for the USD, with traders now focusing on potential shifts in currency pairs, such as USD/EUR, as energy markets continue to impact broader economic sentiment. Market participants are watching closely for any updates on the geopolitical situation and its effects on both energy prices and the broader forex landscape.

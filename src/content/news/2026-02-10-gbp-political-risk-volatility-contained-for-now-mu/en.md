The GBP experienced heightened volatility as UK political risks surged, with the EUR/GBP pair spiking to a high of 0.8742. The political uncertainty drove significant fluctuations in the exchange rate, though the pair later pulled back to around 0.8700. Despite these movements, MUFG's Senior Currency Analyst Lee Hardman suggests that the volatility appears contained for now, stabilizing after initial turbulence.

While the pound faces ongoing political challenges, the recent pullback from its highs signals that traders are not overly concerned at this moment. The EUR/GBP's fluctuations reflect market sensitivity to UK political developments, but the broader trend suggests a potential stabilization in the near term. Investors will be watching for further shifts in political sentiment to gauge future currency pair movements.

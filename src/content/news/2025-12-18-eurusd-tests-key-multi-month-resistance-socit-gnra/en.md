EUR/USD has continued its upward trajectory after breaking a short-term downtrend, now testing significant resistance at the 1.18 level. According to analysts at Société Générale, this consolidation phase at the current exchange rate is critical. A decisive movement above this resistance could pave the way for a more substantial bullish trend in the currency pair.

Market participants are closely monitoring the dynamics around the 1.18 mark, as the outcome of this consolidation may influence trading strategies moving forward. A sustained breakout could signal increased buying interest in the euro against the dollar, potentially leading to a shift in market sentiment. Conversely, failure to maintain momentum might prompt a reevaluation of positions within the broader forex landscape.

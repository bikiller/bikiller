Gold (XAU/USD) started the week on a muted note, struggling to regain momentum after a two-day decline. This comes on the heels of a recent rally that pushed prices above a three-week high. Currently, the precious metal is facing downward pressure, trading lower as the strength of the US Dollar and reduced expectations for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts weigh on investor sentiment.

As the USD maintains its dominance in the forex market, the exchange rate dynamics are shifting, impacting gold's appeal as a safe haven. Traders are closely monitoring the Fed's monetary policy signals and any developments that could influence the EUR/USD pair. The outlook for gold remains cautious, with potential volatility expected as market participants digest economic data and geopolitical factors in the coming sessions.

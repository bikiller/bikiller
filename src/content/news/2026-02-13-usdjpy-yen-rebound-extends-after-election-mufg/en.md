The Japanese Yen has extended its rebound, emerging as the best-performing G10 currency this week. USD/JPY sharply dropped following Japan’s recent election, which failed to ignite further Yen weakness. The exchange rate for the currency pair fell significantly, indicating a reversal in the Yen’s downtrend. The market had initially expected the election to push the Yen lower, but the outcome did not trigger that effect.

As a result, traders are now recalibrating their expectations for the USD/JPY exchange rate. The movement highlights a shift in sentiment, with market participants becoming more cautious about further Yen depreciation. This trend is likely to influence trading strategies in the coming days, with the focus turning to broader macroeconomic factors and potential adjustments in monetary policy by the Bank of Japan. The price action reinforces the Yen's resilience despite ongoing global economic challenges.

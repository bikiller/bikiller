Nomura’s Global Markets Research team projects that Euro area HICP inflation will remain close to the European Central Bank’s 2.0% target through 2027. However, inflation risks are expected to shift significantly higher between 2027 and 2028, potentially influencing future monetary policy decisions. This shift could have a notable impact on EUR/USD exchange rates, as traders adjust positions based on inflationary expectations.

As inflation risks in the Eurozone rise, traders will likely monitor ECB statements closely for hints on tightening measures, which could strengthen the euro against the USD. Market expectations may adjust towards a higher rate environment, adding volatility to EUR/USD trading. The outlook also suggests that inflationary pressures may affect broader market sentiment, contributing to fluctuating exchange rates and shifts in capital flows.

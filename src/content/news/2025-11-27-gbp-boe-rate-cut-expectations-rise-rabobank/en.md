As expectations grow for a potential rate cut by the Bank of England, traders are closely monitoring the GBP's movements against persistent inflation and subdued economic growth. According to Rabobank's FX analyst Jane Foley, the outlook for GBP remains complex, particularly following a period of stability in gilt markets. This uncertainty is likely to influence GBP/USD and GBP/EUR exchange rates as investors weigh their positions.

The implications of these rate cut expectations could lead to increased volatility in GBP trading. If the BoE decides to adjust rates amid ongoing inflationary pressures, it may alter the dynamics of key currency pairs, impacting the overall strength of the pound. As markets react to these developments, traders should remain vigilant for potential shifts in the GBP’s value against the USD and EUR.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) is showing strength against the US Dollar (USD) as it approaches a crucial technical juncture, testing the 50- and 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) cluster. This upward momentum comes amid growing trader expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will maintain its current monetary policy during the December meeting, while still adopting a hawkish stance. 

This positive outlook for the AUD has contributed to a solid performance in the AUD/USD currency pair, enhancing its appeal as traders assess potential interest rate trajectories. As the exchange rate continues to fluctuate around these key SMA levels, market participants are closely monitoring any developments that could influence the RBA's future decisions or the broader economic landscape, emphasizing the importance of this period for both currencies.

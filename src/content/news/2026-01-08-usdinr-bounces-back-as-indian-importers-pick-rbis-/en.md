The USD/INR exchange rate showed resilience during Thursday's trading session, rebounding as Indian importers capitalized on the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) intervention-induced decline of the rupee. Following a solid upward movement the previous day, the Indian Rupee (INR) traded lower against the US Dollar (USD), reflecting a shift in market dynamics.

The Indian currency faced selling pressure as importers took advantage of the RBI's measures to stabilize the exchange rate. This intervention led to fluctuations, with traders closely monitoring technical levels for further cues. As market participants assess the implications of the RBI's actions, the USD/INR pair remains a focal point for investors navigating the currency market landscape.

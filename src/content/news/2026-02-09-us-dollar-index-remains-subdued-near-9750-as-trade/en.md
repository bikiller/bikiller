The US Dollar Index (DXY) remains under pressure, trading around 97.60 during the Asian session on Monday. This marks the second consecutive day of losses for the dollar, which has been struggling to regain momentum. The DXY, which gauges the USD’s performance against six major currencies, is facing challenges ahead of upcoming economic data, including inflation and labor market reports, which could influence future policy decisions.

With the USD underperforming, key currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD are seeing increased volatility. The euro has gained traction, pushing the EUR/USD exchange rate higher, while the pound remains resilient, supported by stronger-than-expected UK economic indicators. Traders are closely monitoring the economic calendar, awaiting any developments that could shift sentiment and dictate the next move for the greenback in the near term.

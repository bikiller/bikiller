The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, marking its third consecutive session in the red. The AUD/USD exchange rate fell amid widespread selling in global equities and risk-sensitive assets, as market participants adopted a cautious stance. The Aussie traded at 0.6675, down 0.4% on the day, reflecting the broader risk-off sentiment gripping financial markets.

Risk appetite remained subdued as investor concerns over global economic conditions kept sentiment negative. With global equities under pressure, the AUD faced significant headwinds, mirroring the performance of other risk-linked currencies. Market participants are closely monitoring upcoming economic data, with further weakness in commodity prices potentially adding to the downward pressure on the Australian Dollar in the near term.

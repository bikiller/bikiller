The Australian Dollar (AUD) extended its gains for the third consecutive session, with AUD/USD trading at 0.7120 during Thursday’s Asian trading hours. This rise comes amid growing expectations of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has bolstered investor sentiment towards the Aussie. The currency pair remains near a three-year high as markets price in tighter monetary policy.

The stronger AUD is reflecting increasing optimism over the RBA's potential tightening moves. If the RBA proceeds with an interest rate increase, the exchange rate could see further support, pushing the Australian Dollar even higher against the USD. As the AUD/USD holds above key levels, traders are watching for any developments that could fuel or dampen the rate hike expectations in the near term.

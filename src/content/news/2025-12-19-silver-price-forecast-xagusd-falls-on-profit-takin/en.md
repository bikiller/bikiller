Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a decline, trading around $64.95 during Asian trading hours on Friday. This drop follows a record high in previous sessions, as traders engaged in profit-taking after a significant rally. The pullback highlights the volatility within the precious metals market, especially as investors reassess their positions amid fluctuating market conditions.

Despite the recent dip, silver remains supported by expectations of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which continue to influence the broader market sentiment.

The flash United States S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index data for January is scheduled for release at 14:45 GMT, a key event for forex trading. As a timely gauge of business activity, the PMI often drives short-term moves in the USD, with direct implications for the EUR/USD currency pair and its exchange rate during the European-American session overlap.

Market participants will watch whether the preliminary PMI signals resilience or slowdown in the US economy. A stronger-than-expected reading could support the USD by reinforcing expectations of tighter monetary conditions, potentially pressuring EUR/USD lower. Conversely, softer data may weigh on the dollar, allowing the euro to regain ground as traders reassess growth and interest rate outlooks.

Volatility around the release is common, as algorithmic and discretionary trading react simultaneously to the data. With limited macro releases earlier in the session, EUR/USD could see an outsized response despite the PMI being a preliminary estimate. Traders will also consider how the figures align with recent US data trends and broader risk sentiment across currency markets.

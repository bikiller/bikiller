The AUD/JPY currency pair experienced a slight decline, trading around 109.15 in the early European session on Wednesday. The drop comes amid rising demand for the Japanese Yen (JPY) as foreign inflows into Japanese equities surged following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory. This boost in equity market confidence strengthened JPY against the Australian Dollar (AUD), which remains sensitive to broader market sentiment.

Despite this retreat, the outlook for AUD/JPY remains constructive as long as the exchange rate holds above the critical 109.00 level. A firm trading position above this threshold suggests continued potential for upward movement. Investors are likely to monitor the pair closely, particularly in light of global market trends and any further developments in Japanese economic policies and political stability.

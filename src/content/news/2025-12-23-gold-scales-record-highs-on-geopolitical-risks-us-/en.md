Gold (XAU/USD) surged to a record high during early European trading hours on Tuesday, reflecting a growing demand for safe-haven assets amid escalating geopolitical tensions. The precious metal has experienced a substantial 10% increase over the past month and an astonishing nearly 70% rise in 2025 alone. This upward momentum is largely driven by market uncertainty surrounding global events and the implications for economic stability.

As investors turn to gold, the currency markets are seeing shifts as well, with the USD facing pressure. The ongoing speculation about potential U.S. rate cuts further supports gold's ascent, drawing attention away from traditional currencies like the EUR. This trend highlights the precious metal's role as a hedge against risk, emphasizing the need for traders to monitor geopolitical developments and central bank policies closely.

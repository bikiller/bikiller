Gold (XAU/USD) continues its rally, climbing to new all-time highs as it pushes further into uncharted territory on Wednesday. The precious metal extends its gains for the eighth consecutive day, driven by strong safe-haven demand and a weaker US Dollar (USD). At the time of writing, gold is trading at $2,080, reflecting a notable uptick in value as investors remain cautious ahead of key events.

The ongoing rally is also supported by a softening USD, which is providing additional momentum for gold. The EUR/USD currency pair shows slight gains as well, reflecting broader weakness in the USD. With the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision looming, traders are adjusting positions, anticipating potential impacts on both gold prices and the broader forex market. The upcoming Fed meeting could further influence the USD, potentially leading to more volatile moves in gold and other major currencies.

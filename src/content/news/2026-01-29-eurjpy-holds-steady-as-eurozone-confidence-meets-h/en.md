EUR/JPY remains steady around 183.25 as Thursday trading shows little movement. The currency pair has struggled to build on its recent upward momentum, despite positive economic data from the Eurozone. The Eurozone's robust economic confidence continues to support the Euro (EUR), but the Japanese Yen (JPY) is buoyed by domestic factors, preventing a significant shift in the exchange rate.

The Japanese central bank's hawkish stance is also playing a pivotal role in stabilizing JPY. Despite favorable economic indicators from the EU, the Bank of Japan's focus on curbing inflation and maintaining policy divergence between the EUR and JPY keeps the pair in a tight range. With EUR/JPY holding near key levels, traders remain cautious ahead of potential shifts in the broader currency market.

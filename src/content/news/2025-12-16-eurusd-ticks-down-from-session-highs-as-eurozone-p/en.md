EUR/USD has retreated from session highs of 1.1764 to trade nearly flat at 1.1750, reflecting a cautious market response. The downward movement comes in the wake of disappointing preliminary PMI data for both Manufacturing and Services in the Eurozone, which failed to meet analysts' expectations and signaled potential economic weakness across some major economies in the region.

This pullback in the EUR/USD currency pair highlights the impact of macroeconomic indicators on exchange rate fluctuations. As traders digest the implications of the weaker PMIs, the euro faces pressure against the USD, raising concerns about potential shifts in monetary policy outlooks within the Eurozone. Market participants will be closely monitoring upcoming economic data to gauge the sustainability of the current trading levels.

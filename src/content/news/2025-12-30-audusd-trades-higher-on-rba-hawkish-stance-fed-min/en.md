AUD/USD is trading higher around 0.6700, reflecting a modest increase of 0.10% on the day. The upward movement can be attributed to a hawkish stance from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which has bolstered the Australian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Traders are keeping a close eye on this currency pair as they anticipate further insights from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) December meeting minutes.

Market sentiment remains cautious as investors await the FOMC minutes, which could provide clarity on the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy direction. With the USD currently under pressure, the AUD/USD exchange rate may see further volatility depending on the tone and content of the forthcoming release. As traders digest these developments, the focus remains on the interplay between the RBA's positioning and the Fed's upcoming policy signals.

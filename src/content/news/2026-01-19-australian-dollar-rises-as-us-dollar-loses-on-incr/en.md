The Australian Dollar (AUD) gained strength against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, buoyed by the latest TD-MI Inflation Gauge report, which indicated a year-over-year increase to 3.5% in December, up from 3.2% previously. This positive inflation data contributed to a rise in the AUD/USD exchange rate, reflecting heightened risk aversion in the market as traders shifted their focus.

As the market digested the inflation figures, the US Dollar faced downward pressure, leading to a decline in its value across various currency pairs. The AUD's advance signals potential shifts in trading sentiment, as investors evaluate the implications of Australia's rising inflation on future monetary policy. The AUD/USD trading action showcases the ongoing volatility driven by economic indicators and market dynamics.

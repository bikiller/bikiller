GBP/USD is trading slightly higher, currently hovering around 1.3510 during the Asian session on Monday. The pair opened with a gap down but quickly regained ground as the US Dollar (USD) faced downward pressure. This movement is largely influenced by market anticipation of two potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026, which has diminished confidence in the greenback.

As expectations for USD weakness grow, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the GBP/USD exchange rate. The currency pair's ability to sustain levels above 1.3500 suggests a shift in sentiment among investors, who may be reassessing their positions in light of the Fed's future monetary policy. With the broader market eyeing these developments, fluctuations in this currency pair could signal further trends in the forex market.

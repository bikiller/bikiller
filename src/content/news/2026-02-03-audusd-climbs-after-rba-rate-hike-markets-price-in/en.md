The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, following the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) widely anticipated interest rate hike. The AUD/USD pair surged as the RBA raised rates, fueling expectations of further tightening in the coming months. The Aussie traded at 0.6920, reflecting a notable uptick after the central bank's decision.

This move highlights the growing divergence in monetary policies between the RBA and the Federal Reserve. With markets pricing in additional hikes, AUD/USD saw bullish momentum, gaining around 0.4% on the day. Traders are now watching closely for any signals of more aggressive tightening, which could drive the pair higher in the short term. The market reaction suggests heightened optimism around the Australian economy amid global uncertainty.

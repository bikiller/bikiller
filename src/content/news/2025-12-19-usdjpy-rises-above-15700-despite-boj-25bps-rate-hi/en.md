The USD/JPY currency pair has surged above the 157.00 mark following the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) decision to raise its policy rate by 25 basis points. Despite this anticipated rate hike, the Japanese yen failed to gain traction, leading to the exchange rate climbing to its highest level in nearly a month. 

Market analysts suggest that the BoJ's move, while significant, did not provide the expected support for the yen, indicating persistent selling pressure. As traders react to this development, the implications could signal continued volatility in the forex market, particularly for the USD/JPY pair, which remains under close scrutiny as it navigates these elevated levels.

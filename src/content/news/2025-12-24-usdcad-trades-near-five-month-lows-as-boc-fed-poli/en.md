The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is demonstrating resilience against the US Dollar (USD) as USD/CAD hovers around 1.3675, close to its lowest point since July 25. This performance reflects a notable divergence in monetary policy between the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve, which is currently favoring the Loonie. 

As the market heads into the holiday season, trading activity has been subdued, yet the firm stance of the USD has not translated into gains against CAD. The current exchange rate indicates the influence of policy shifts, suggesting a potential continuation of this trend if the BoC maintains its approach relative to the Fed's direction.

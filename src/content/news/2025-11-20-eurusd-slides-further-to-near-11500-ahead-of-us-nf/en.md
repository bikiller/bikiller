The EUR/USD currency pair continued its downward trajectory on Thursday, marking the fifth consecutive day of losses. During the European trading session, the exchange rate slipped to approximately 1.1500, approaching an almost two-week low. This decline underscores the pair's vulnerability amid market anticipation for upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data.

Analysts suggest that the ongoing weakness in the eurozone economy, coupled with expectations of stronger labor market indicators from the US, is contributing to the euro's decline against the dollar. As traders await the NFP report, the focus remains on how the data will influence future monetary policy decisions, potentially leading to further volatility in the EUR/USD exchange rate.

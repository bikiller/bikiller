The USD/JPY currency pair is drawing attention as the US Federal Reserve engages in discussions with local New York banks regarding their positions. This move has sparked speculation that the US may be coordinating with Japan to address the yen's ongoing weakness. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate, with the yen struggling to gain ground against the dollar in recent weeks.

The USD/JPY currency pair experienced a decline, dipping to approximately 156.00 after a brief period of modest gains in the previous session. During Asian trading hours on Monday, the exchange rate hovered around 156.20, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

This downward movement follows comments from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which hinted at potential policy tightening by 2026. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as any shift in monetary policy could significantly impact the yen's value against the dollar, influencing broader market dynamics. As such, the outlook for USD/JPY remains carefully balanced amid evolving economic signals.

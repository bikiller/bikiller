The Pound Sterling (GBP) continued its upward momentum against major currencies on Tuesday, pushing the exchange rate to nearly 1.3500 against the US Dollar (USD), a level not seen in almost 12 weeks. As European trading unfolded, the GBP showed strength, reflecting market optimism regarding the Bank of England's (BoE) potential for a moderate policy easing path.

This rise in the GBP is significant as it underscores the currency's resilience amid shifting monetary policies. With the BoE indicating a cautious approach, traders are closely monitoring developments. The positive sentiment surrounding the pound could lead to further gains in the currency pair, as investors adjust their positions in anticipation of future interest rate movements.

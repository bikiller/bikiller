The USD/JPY currency pair has shown a retracement in its recent gains, currently trading around 156.10 during European trading hours on Monday. This decline marks a significant move as the pair broke below the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), indicating potential bearish momentum. 

Technical indicators reveal the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 52.80, suggesting a neutral position after easing from previously higher levels. This shift in sentiment could have implications for traders, as the market navigates between resistance and support levels, with the exchange rate hovering near the critical 156.00 mark.

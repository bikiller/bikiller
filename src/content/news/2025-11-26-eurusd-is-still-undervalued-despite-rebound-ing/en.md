EUR/USD continues to show signs of being undervalued, even in light of its recent uptick. According to ING’s FX analyst Francesco Pesole, the currency pair is poised to gravitate towards its short-term fair value, estimated around 1.170. This movement is largely influenced by geopolitical developments, particularly growing optimism surrounding a potential truce in Ukraine.

As traders navigate the complexities of the market, the exchange rate dynamics between the euro and the U.S. dollar will be shaped by these geopolitical factors. A resolution in Ukraine could further enhance confidence in the euro, pushing the EUR/USD pair closer to its fair value. Market participants should closely monitor these developments, as they are likely to have significant implications for future trading strategies.

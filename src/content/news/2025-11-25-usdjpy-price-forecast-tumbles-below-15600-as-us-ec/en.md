USD/JPY experienced a notable decline on Tuesday, plummeting over 0.54% to fall below the critical 156.00 level. This shift was largely influenced by growing investor sentiment that the Federal Reserve is poised to cut interest rates in its December meeting, spurred by a disappointing US inflation report and weaker-than-expected retail sales figures.

As the currency pair adjusts to these economic signals, the exchange rate reflects concerns about the slowing US economy. Traders are recalibrating their positions in anticipation of potential policy changes from the Fed, which could further impact the USD's strength against the JPY in the coming weeks. The market will closely monitor economic indicators for further direction.

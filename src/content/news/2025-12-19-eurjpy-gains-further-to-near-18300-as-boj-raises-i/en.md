The EUR/JPY currency pair has surged near the 183.00 mark as the Japanese Yen continues to weaken following a significant monetary policy shift by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). On Friday, the BoJ raised its interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.75%, prompting traders to adjust their positions in the forex market.

This decision has strengthened the Euro against the Yen, contributing to the upward momentum of the exchange rate. As traders respond to the shift in monetary policy, the implications for future trading strategies may involve reevaluating positions on both EUR and JPY, considering the evolving economic landscape in Japan and the Eurozone.

The USD/INR currency pair hovered near 90.80 during Tuesday’s afternoon session in India, holding flat around Monday’s low as traders refrained from taking aggressive positions. The exchange rate showed limited volatility, reflecting cautious trading conditions ahead of the US market open. Market participants appeared reluctant to drive the USD or INR decisively in either direction without fresh catalysts.

Attention is firmly on the upcoming release of the FOMC Minutes, which could shape expectations around US interest rate policy and influence broader USD sentiment. Any signals from the Federal Reserve regarding the pace of easing or inflation risks may trigger renewed movement across major currency pairs, including USD/INR and EUR/USD. As a result, intraday trading volumes remained subdued.

For the Indian Rupee, stability near 90.80 suggests near-term consolidation, though external drivers remain critical. A hawkish tone in the Minutes could strengthen the USD and push the exchange rate higher, while dovish signals may allow the INR to recover modestly. Traders are closely monitoring global risk appetite and US Treasury yields for direction.

The USD/JPY currency pair surged on Wednesday as the Japanese Yen’s recent rally lost momentum, marking its best weekly performance since November 2024. After a strong push from the Yen, the exchange rate reversed, fueled by weak Japanese GDP data that highlighted concerns about the country’s economic outlook. At the same time, speculation around the Bank of Japan’s potential interest rate hikes contributed to the shift in momentum.

As a result, USD/JPY saw a notable bounce back, trading higher as traders recalibrated their positions. The Yen, which had been outperforming the USD, faced resistance near key technical levels. With the pair stabilizing above the 130.00 mark, investors now focus on upcoming economic releases and BoJ policy signals, which will likely drive the next phase of trading for the pair.

The AUD/JPY currency pair is experiencing a pullback, trading near the 104.00 level after a six-day winning streak came to an end during the early European session on Wednesday. This decline is attributed to weaker-than-anticipated producer deflation data from China, which has negatively impacted the Australian Dollar (AUD) as a proxy for Chinese economic performance against the Japanese Yen (JPY).

As the exchange rate softens, the overbought Relative Strength Index (RSI) suggests limited upside potential for the AUD/JPY. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as further weakening of the AUD could influence broader market sentiment, especially concerning the dynamics of the Asia-Pacific region and its impact on key currency pairs, including those involving the USD and EUR.

The USD/JPY currency pair has seen a modest recovery after finding support at the 152.30 level, with the US Dollar (USD) trimming its losses on Friday. Trading in the 153.00s, the pair is now edging above the 153.50 mark, as market participants await the release of crucial US CPI data. The inflation figures could provide further direction for the exchange rate, particularly ahead of potential Federal Reserve actions.

As the USD/JPY moves back into the upper range of the 153.00s, traders are closely monitoring US economic indicators. The currency pair's recent support near 152.30 highlights the level's importance, while the focus shifts to upcoming US inflation data, which may influence broader market sentiment. The result could determine whether the USD maintains its strength against the Japanese Yen or faces renewed pressure.

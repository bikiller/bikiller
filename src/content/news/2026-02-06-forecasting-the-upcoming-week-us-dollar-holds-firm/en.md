The US Dollar (USD) remained largely unchanged this week as markets digested the nomination of Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve Chair and the conclusion of the partial US government shutdown. The shutdown's end temporarily eased concerns over employment, but market attention remains on upcoming economic data, including Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) and Consumer Price Index (CPI) reports. These events are expected to influence the USD’s movement in the coming week.

The EUR/USD pair traded near 1.1300, with limited volatility despite the key developments. Technical levels suggest that if the pair moves below the 1.1250 mark, further declines may follow. Meanwhile, the USD/JPY pair hovered around 113.50, maintaining its stability ahead of potential shifts in risk sentiment and economic indicators. Traders are eyeing NFP and CPI data for clues on future Fed policy and the broader economic outlook.

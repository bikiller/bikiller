Gold prices have stabilized around USD 5,200 per troy ounce, bolstered by ongoing geopolitical tensions, including concerns over U.S. tariffs and the escalating U.S.-Iran conflict. Safe-haven demand has been evident through strong ETF inflows, highlighting investor uncertainty in broader markets. Despite this support, physical demand from India remains weak due to the high price level, limiting buying activity in the world's second-largest gold consumer.

The divergence in gold's performance reflects contrasting forces within the market. While safe-haven flows are helping to maintain gold's price, especially amid volatile trading conditions, the lack of physical buying in India underscores the sensitivity of gold demand to price levels. As long as geopolitical risks persist, gold may continue to see sustained support, but the current price may restrict further growth in demand from key consumer markets like India.

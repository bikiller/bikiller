The Australian Dollar (AUD) is experiencing a pullback against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, trading at approximately 0.6677. This movement comes as the market processes the latest US inflation data, which has contributed to a strengthened Greenback. The exchange rate reflects a complete retracement of the gains made by the AUD in the prior session.

Traders are closely monitoring the implications of the inflation figures, as they could influence the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. The current market dynamics suggest a cautious sentiment, with the AUD/USD currency pair facing downward pressure as investors weigh the potential for further USD strength in the wake of the data release.

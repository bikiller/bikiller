The Japanese Yen (JPY) has strengthened against most major currencies as traders brace for the Bank of Japan's anticipated interest rate hike, the first since January. Analysts at BBH noted that recent PMI data indicates modest growth, fueling speculation about the central bank's potential shift towards policy normalization. This has led to JPY trading higher, impacting key currency pairs such as USD/JPY and EUR/JPY.

As market participants await the BOJ's decision, the exchange rate dynamics are shifting. A successful rate hike could further bolster the yen, influencing other currency pairs and global market sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring the developments, as any indication of a change in the BOJ's stance may usher in significant adjustments across the forex landscape.

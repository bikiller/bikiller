The US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the USD against a basket of six major currencies, remains subdued around the 98.50 level. Following modest gains in the previous session, the index is trading lower during the Asian hours on Wednesday, reflecting a broader risk-on sentiment in the market. Investors are keenly watching upcoming US economic data that could influence trading dynamics.

As traders assess the implications of the latest economic indicators, fluctuations in the USD may impact key currency pairs, including EUR/USD and USD/JPY. The current exchange rate environment suggests that any significant shifts in US data could lead to volatility in the Forex market, particularly affecting the dollar's strength against its counterparts.

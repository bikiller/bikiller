The EUR/GBP currency pair saw a notable decline on Friday, with the Euro weakening against the British Pound following stronger-than-expected UK economic data. UK PMIs and Retail Sales exceeded market expectations, bolstering the Pound and driving the exchange rate lower. At the time of writing, EUR/GBP was trading at 0.8677, after hitting a three-week high near 0.8745 earlier this week.

The positive UK data has supported the Pound's performance against major currencies, while the Euro's momentum faltered. The current price action reflects the divergence in economic strength between the two regions, with GBP benefiting from robust figures. Traders will be closely watching future UK releases and broader eurozone data for further direction in the EUR/GBP pair.

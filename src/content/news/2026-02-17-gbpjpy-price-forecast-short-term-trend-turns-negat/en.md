GBP/JPY snapped a two-day winning streak on Tuesday, with the currency pair slipping back below the key 210.00 handle as sentiment toward the British Pound deteriorated. The exchange rate came under pressure after weak UK labour market data reinforced expectations that the Bank of England could move closer to cutting interest rates. The shift in rate outlook weighed heavily on GBP trading across the board.

The softer employment figures dampened confidence in the UK economic outlook, prompting traders to reassess the timing of potential BoE easing. As rate-cut bets gained traction, Sterling lost ground not only against the Japanese Yen but also versus the USD and EUR. The break below 210.00 marks a notable technical setback, suggesting the short-term trend has turned negative.

From a technical perspective, sustained trading beneath the 210.00 level may open the door for deeper losses if bearish momentum builds. Market participants will closely monitor upcoming UK data and broader risk sentiment, as shifts in global yields and USD dynamics could further influence the GBP/JPY exchange rate in the near term.

Silver (XAG/USD) slipped below its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) during the North American session, falling nearly 1% after peaking at $78.20 earlier in the day. The retreat reflects pressure from a stronger US Dollar, which has been gaining momentum across the forex market.

The rise in USD strength, coupled with mixed sentiment in broader financial markets, has dampened demand for silver as a safe-haven asset. The XAG/USD pair now faces immediate support near the $77.50 level, with any sustained break below this could signal further downside, especially if USD strength persists in the coming sessions.

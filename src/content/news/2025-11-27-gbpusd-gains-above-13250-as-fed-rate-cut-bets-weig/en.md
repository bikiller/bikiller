GBP/USD has extended its rally for the sixth consecutive session, currently trading around 1.3260 during the Asian hours on Thursday. This upward movement comes as the US Dollar (USD) faces pressure from increasing speculation surrounding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts in December, which are dampening sentiment for the currency.

As market participants adjust their expectations, the exchange rate reflects a growing divergence between the outlook for GBP and USD. With GBP continuing to gain ground, traders are closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence future policy decisions from the Fed, potentially further impacting the currency pair's trajectory in the coming sessions.

The GBP/JPY currency pair advanced 0.33% to trade near 209.30 during Monday’s European session, rebounding after last week’s decline. The exchange rate found support as the Japanese Yen weakened in response to Japan’s fourth-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, which showed the economy returning to growth. The recovery in the cross reflects shifting sentiment in early-week forex trading.

The Yen’s pullback followed the GDP release, prompting traders to reassess expectations around the Bank of Japan’s policy trajectory. While Japan’s economy expanded in Q4, the data failed to trigger sustained JPY strength, allowing GBP/JPY to regain ground. The move highlights how macroeconomic indicators continue to shape currency pair dynamics across global markets, alongside broader USD and EUR fluctuations.

Sterling’s relative resilience also contributed to the upside, with market participants positioning for further volatility across major exchange rates. As trading volumes build, investors will monitor whether GBP/JPY can hold above the 209.00 region, which now acts as a near-term technical pivot. Sustained momentum above 209.30 could open the door for additional gains, while renewed Yen demand may cap advances.

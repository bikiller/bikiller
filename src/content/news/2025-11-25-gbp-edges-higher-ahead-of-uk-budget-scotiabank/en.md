The Pound Sterling (GBP) has gained slight momentum as traders prepare for the upcoming UK budget announcement on Wednesday. Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, note that much of the existing market sentiment has already absorbed pessimistic expectations, suggesting a potential for a near-term relief rally in GBP trading. This anticipation is reflected in the GBP/USD exchange rate, which is showing signs of strength.

As the market approaches the budget release, the outlook for GBP remains cautiously optimistic. The currency pair's performance may hinge on the specifics of the fiscal plans unveiled, which could either reinforce or undermine current bullish sentiment. Traders are closely monitoring the GBP/EUR exchange rate as well, with forecasts suggesting volatility ahead, driven by broader economic indicators and geopolitical developments impacting the UK economy.

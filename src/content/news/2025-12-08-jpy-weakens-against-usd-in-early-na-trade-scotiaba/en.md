The Japanese Yen (JPY) has weakened by 0.2% against the US Dollar (USD) in early North American trading. As the USD strengthens, driven by rising US yields and solid domestic rate expectations, the JPY has struggled to maintain its footing, underperforming its G10 counterparts. This shift in the exchange rate reflects a broader trend in the market as traders react to evolving monetary policies.

The increased yield on US Treasuries has heightened demand for the dollar, influencing traders' positions across the currency pair. As a result, market sentiment is leaning towards the USD, particularly amid expectations of further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. The implications for the JPY are significant, as continued pressure could lead to further depreciation if this trend persists.

The GBP/USD currency pair found support near the crucial 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA), bouncing back from a near three-week low reached during the Asian trading session on Monday. As concerns surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy continue to weigh on the USD, traders are eyeing a potential recovery towards the mid-1.3400s.

This rebound in the exchange rate reflects broader market sentiment, with the dollar facing pressure amid speculation about interest rate adjustments by the Fed. As the GBP/USD moves away from recent lows, traders will closely monitor economic indicators and central bank communications that could further influence the trading dynamics of this currency pair.

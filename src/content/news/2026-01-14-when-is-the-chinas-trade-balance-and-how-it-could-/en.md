China's General Administration of Customs is set to release its December trade balance data on Wednesday at 03:00 GMT. Analysts anticipate a widening of the trade surplus to $113.60 billion, up from the previous figure of $111.68 billion. This increase may influence trading in the AUD/USD currency pair, as a stronger trade balance often bolsters demand for the Australian dollar against the US dollar.

Market participants will closely monitor the implications of this data release. A robust trade balance could signal economic strength in China, potentially leading to improved risk sentiment and upward pressure on the Australian dollar. Conversely, if the actual figures fall short of expectations, it might trigger a decline in AUD/USD exchange rates as traders reevaluate their positions in anticipation of a weaker economic outlook.

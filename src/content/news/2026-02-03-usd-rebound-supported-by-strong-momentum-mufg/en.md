The US Dollar (USD) has seen a notable rebound at the start of the week, driven by strong momentum in the market. The rebound follows President Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve Chair, which has boosted market confidence in a potential hawkish policy shift. As a result, USD trading surged, with the USD/EUR exchange rate climbing higher, reflecting increased demand for the greenback.

In addition to the Fed nomination, positive economic data has supported the USD's momentum. Reports showing strong job growth and stable inflation have further bolstered expectations of tightening monetary policy. This solid performance in the currency markets is helping the USD recover from recent lows, with traders closely monitoring key technical levels. The outlook for the USD remains optimistic, with traders eyeing potential further gains in USD/EUR and other currency pairs if the economic data continues to support strength in the US economy.

The US Dollar (USD) maintained its upward momentum on Thursday, reaching six-month highs amid a decline in expectations for a December interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve (Fed). This bullish sentiment has been bolstered as traders reassess the potential for tighter monetary policy, driving the USD to strengthen against major currencies.

The EUR/USD exchange rate reflects this shift, with the dollar gaining traction as investors pivot away from the euro. As market participants analyze upcoming PMI data, the implications for future Federal Reserve decisions will be closely monitored, influencing the trading landscape.

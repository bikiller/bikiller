West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is hovering around $65.65 during early European trading hours on Friday. Despite a slight uptick on the day, WTI is set to close the week lower, marking a potential weekly drop. The price movement comes as the United States and Iran continue their nuclear negotiations, which have created uncertainty in the market and weighed on sentiment.

The ongoing talks between the US and Iran are keeping traders cautious, contributing to the week’s decline in WTI prices. The uncertainty surrounding potential changes to Iranian oil exports, along with fluctuating demand expectations, has led to volatility in the commodity. With crude prices struggling to gain momentum, market participants are closely watching any developments in the diplomatic discussions, which could have a significant impact on the broader oil market outlook and related currency pairs.

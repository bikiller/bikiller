The Indian Rupee (INR) opened nearly flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair trading around 90.80. Market participants appeared cautious, keeping the exchange rate in a tight range as they awaited key insights from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes scheduled for 19:00 GMT. Trading volumes remained moderate, reflecting a wait-and-watch sentiment across both domestic and global forex markets.  

Analysts noted that the USD/INR pair has been hovering near technical resistance at 91.00, while support continues to hold around 90.50. The broader forex landscape, including the EUR/USD and other major pairs, showed muted moves ahead of the US central bank update. Investors are particularly focused on any hints regarding interest rate adjustments or shifts in monetary policy, which could trigger more pronounced moves in the INR and other emerging market currencies.  

A sharp reaction to the FOMC Minutes could set the tone for intraday and medium-term trading in the USD/INR. Traders are likely to adjust positions based on the Fed’s commentary, which may influence hedging strategies and cross-currency flows. With the rupee trading steady near 90.80, market watchers expect volatility to rise only if the minutes reveal unexpected policy guidance or economic outlook changes, impacting both domestic and global forex dynamics.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced a notable decline against its major currency counterparts on Wednesday, driven by the anticipated slowdown in UK inflation. Following the release of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for October, GBP/USD dropped to 1.2210, while GBP/EUR slipped to 1.1550. The inflation figures indicated a cooling trend, leading traders to reassess their expectations for future monetary policy.

As market participants reacted to the softer inflation numbers, the exchange rate movement reflected a cautious sentiment. The slowdown in inflation could have significant implications for the Bank of England's interest rate strategy, potentially reducing the likelihood of aggressive rate hikes in the near term. Consequently, the GBP showed weakness against the USD and EUR, indicating a shift in market dynamics as traders position themselves for upcoming economic developments.

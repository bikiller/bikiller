MUFG's Asia FX team maintains a positive outlook on the Singapore Dollar (SGD), supported by a strong Chinese Yuan (CNY) and robust domestic growth. The team believes the SGD will benefit from the resilience of the CNY, with both currencies moving in tandem. This correlation is expected to provide stability for the SGD against the USD in the near term.

As the USD/SGD currency pair continues to trade, the outlook remains constructive, with analysts predicting that the SGD will hold steady, bolstered by the ongoing strength of China’s economy. The firm domestic growth in Singapore further reinforces the SGD's position, allowing it to maintain its value against major currencies, including the EUR. This dynamic presents an opportunity for traders to take a cautious, but optimistic approach toward the Singapore Dollar in upcoming sessions.

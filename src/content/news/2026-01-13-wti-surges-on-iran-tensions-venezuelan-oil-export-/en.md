West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices surged to around $60.80 per barrel on Tuesday, marking a 2.45% increase and extending a bullish trend over the past four days. This rise has propelled WTI to its highest level in two months, driven primarily by escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which have heightened concerns over supply disruptions.

However, the gains in WTI prices have been tempered by the resumption of oil exports from Venezuela. This development could contribute to a more stable supply in the global market, potentially influencing exchange rates for currencies such as the USD and EUR as traders weigh the implications for energy prices. As the market navigates these contrasting dynamics, fluctuations in the oil market will likely continue to affect broader trading sentiment.

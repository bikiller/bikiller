The recent sell-off of the USD was perceived as overextended, prompting a notable rebound last Friday. Analysts at ING noted that the dollar's current pricing reflects a more balanced valuation after experiencing rapid declines. This correction was supported by shifts in market sentiment and trading volumes, leading to increased demand for the greenback against major currency pairs.

In particular, the EUR/USD exchange rate responded, retracing some losses as investors reassessed their positions. The dollar's performance against other currencies also showed signs of stabilization, suggesting that traders may now view the USD more favorably. This adjustment could have implications for future trading strategies, as market participants calibrate their expectations for U.S. economic indicators and interest rate trends.

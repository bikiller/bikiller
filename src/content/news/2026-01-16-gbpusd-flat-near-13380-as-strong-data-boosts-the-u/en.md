The GBP/USD currency pair remained flat near the 1.3380 mark during the North American trading session on Friday, following a peak of 1.3413 earlier in the day. The British Pound's advance was curtailed by robust economic data from the United States, which bolstered the USD's strength against its major counterparts.

As traders analyzed the implications of the strong US data, the exchange rate reflected a cautious sentiment in the market. The steady performance of the GBP suggests that while the Pound has shown resilience, the ongoing strength of the USD may limit significant upward movement in the near term. Market participants will be closely watching any further developments that could impact the dynamics between these two currencies.

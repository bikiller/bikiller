The USD/INR exchange rate gained ground as the Indian Rupee (INR) weakened in response to a broad risk-off sentiment across global markets. The US Dollar continues to strengthen, supported by cautious investor sentiment ahead of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. Asian currencies also showed weakness, further pressuring the INR. The pair is expected to trade within the 90.50–91.00 range as market participants await further cues from the US economic indicators.

The risk aversion in the forex market has kept the USD/INR pair on an upward trajectory, with limited room for significant pullbacks. Investors are staying on edge ahead of key US data, keeping the broader risk-off trend intact. The focus remains on potential US inflation readings, which could influence future Fed policy and affect broader currency movements. For now, the 90.50–91.00 range offers short-term technical support and resistance levels.

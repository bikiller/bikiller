Japanese financial markets are experiencing increased volatility following new fiscal commitments announced ahead of the February snap election. This development has led to a significant sell-off in long-dated Japanese government bonds (JGBs), causing yields to surge. The heightened uncertainty surrounding political stability is weighing on the Japanese yen, with the USD/JPY exchange rate reflecting this pressure as traders reassess their positions.

As the markets react to these fiscal promises, the implications for the yen could be profound.

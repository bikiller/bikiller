Silver prices, represented by the currency pair XAG/USD, have dipped to approximately $56.70 during Asian trading hours on Tuesday. This decline follows a record high reached in the previous session, where profit-taking has been cited as a significant factor behind the pullback. Traders are recalibrating their positions after the recent surge, prompting this downward movement.

As traders adjust their strategies, the current exchange rate reflects the volatility inherent in the silver market. The outlook remains closely tied to broader market trends and investor sentiment, particularly in relation to the strength of the USD and potential shifts in risk appetite. Continued fluctuations in XAG/USD highlight the dynamic nature of precious metals trading and the ongoing impact of global economic developments.

TD Securities has issued a bearish outlook on the USD, citing robust global growth and a diminishing appeal for safe-haven currencies. This sentiment is expected to influence trading in key currency pairs, particularly against the EUR and JPY. As investors seek higher returns amid favorable economic conditions, the USD may face downward pressure, affecting its exchange rates.

The firm notes that the current market dynamics could lead to increased volatility, prompting traders to reassess their positions. With the USD under scrutiny, the potential for further declines against major currencies could have significant implications for forex strategies, particularly for those trading USD/EUR and USD/JPY pairs. As the market evolves, traders should remain vigilant on economic indicators that could shift sentiment towards the dollar.

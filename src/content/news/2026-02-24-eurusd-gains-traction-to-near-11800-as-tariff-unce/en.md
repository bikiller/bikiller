The EUR/USD currency pair has gained momentum, reaching 1.1795 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. This upward movement comes as the US Dollar (USD) shows weakness against the Euro (EUR), driven by ongoing uncertainty surrounding US tariffs. Traders are cautious ahead of key economic data, particularly the US January Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which is set for release on Friday.

The current exchange rate of EUR/USD reflects growing concerns over potential tariff impacts, which have placed pressure on the USD. As the market waits for the PPI data, attention will shift to how these figures might influence future Federal Reserve policy and further affect the currency pair’s performance. With the Euro staying resilient, the pair’s movement is likely to remain sensitive to US economic updates in the coming days.

The EUR/GBP currency pair is experiencing moderate gains, trading around 0.8790 in early European trading on Monday. This upward movement comes in response to disappointing UK Retail Sales data for October, which has weakened the Pound Sterling against the Euro. As traders react to the figures, the exchange rate reflects heightened sensitivity to economic indicators impacting the GBP.

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor Germany's November IFO Business Survey, set to be released later today. The results may influence the EUR's performance, as traders assess how current economic conditions in Germany could affect the broader Eurozone outlook. With the EUR/GBP pair hovering near the key level of 0.8800, any significant shifts in sentiment could lead to increased volatility in trading sessions to come.

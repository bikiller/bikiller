EUR/USD fell for the second consecutive day, slipping 0.49% to trade under 1.1800. The decline follows last Friday's sharp drop in metal prices, which supported the U.S. dollar at the expense of the euro. The currency pair has faced downward pressure as the dollar benefits from strong economic data and expectations of tighter Fed policy.

Further contributing to the euro's weakness was the nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the Federal Reserve, reinforcing market speculation of a more hawkish stance. With these factors in play, the exchange rate has been moving lower, reflecting growing confidence in the USD's strength amid a robust economic outlook for the U.S. This shift in sentiment has traders adjusting their positions as the pair tests key technical levels.

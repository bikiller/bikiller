The Australian Dollar (AUD) remains largely unchanged against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, as the latter maintains strength across the forex market. AUD/USD trades at 0.7072, a slight dip from the three-year high of 0.7147 reached late last week. The Greenback's resilience continues to pressure the Aussie, despite last week’s gains.

Traders are now looking to the upcoming release of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes for further direction. Market participants are keen to gauge any hints of policy shifts or changes in economic outlook, which could impact the AUD’s trajectory in the near term. The exchange rate remains vulnerable to USD-driven fluctuations, especially with the dollar’s broad-based strength.

USD/CAD remains in a range-bound trading pattern as softer Canadian inflation figures weigh on market sentiment. Brown Brothers Harriman’s Elias Haddad anticipates a moderation in Canada’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) for January, with inflation expected to ease further. This supports expectations that the Bank of Canada will maintain its policy rate at 2.25% for the foreseeable future, keeping the exchange rate stable.

With inflation likely to remain near target by Q1, the outlook for the Canadian dollar remains cautiously optimistic. Traders are likely to maintain a neutral stance on USD/CAD in the short term, waiting for clearer signals from upcoming data or policy shifts. The currency pair is trading within a defined range, reflecting the market’s uncertainty about immediate monetary adjustments in Canada.

This marks the tenth consecutive day of gains, driven by strong trade data from New Zealand. The robust economic figures have fueled positive sentiment towards the Kiwi dollar, helping it maintain its position against the USD.

With the pair's consistent rise, the New Zealand dollar has seen impressive stability, supported by favorable trade balances and an overall strengthening of the local economy.

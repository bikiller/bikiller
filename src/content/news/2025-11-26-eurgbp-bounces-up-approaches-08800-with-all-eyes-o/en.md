The EUR/GBP currency pair is showing signs of recovery as it bounces back above the 0.8790 level on Wednesday. This upward movement comes after the Euro dipped to a three-week low around 0.8760, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming UK budget, which could influence further fluctuations in the exchange rate.

As the Euro regains some ground against the British Pound, the exchange rate approaches the key psychological level of 0.8800. Currency analysts suggest that any announcements from the UK government could lead to increased volatility in the forex market, particularly for the EUR/GBP pair. Investors remain cautious, weighing the potential impact on future trading strategies.

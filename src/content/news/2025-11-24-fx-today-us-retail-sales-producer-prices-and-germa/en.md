The US Dollar (USD) extended its minor pullback from Friday, flirting with a three-day low as market participants anticipated additional interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. This sentiment pressured the USD, particularly against the Euro (EUR), where the EUR/USD exchange rate showed signs of strength, climbing to levels not seen in recent trading sessions.

As traders look ahead, key economic indicators including US retail sales and producer prices, alongside German GDP figures, will be crucial in shaping market expectations. These data points are likely to provide further insight into economic health and inflation trends, influencing future currency movements and trading strategies in the forex market.

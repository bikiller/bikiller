Silver (XAG/USD) is currently facing selling pressure after a brief uptick during the Asian session, reaching approximately $51.85. This movement marks a retreat from the weekly high achieved in the previous trading session, as market participants reassess their positions in light of recent price fluctuations.

Technical analysis suggests that XAG/USD could find support around the 200-period SMA on the H4 chart, estimated at $50.00. Traders will be closely monitoring this level, as a sustained break below could signal further weakness in the currency pair, impacting overall trading sentiment in the silver market.

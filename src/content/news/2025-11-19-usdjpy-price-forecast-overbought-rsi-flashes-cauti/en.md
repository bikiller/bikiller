The USD/JPY currency pair continued its upward momentum on Wednesday, reaching levels not seen since mid-January. The exchange rate has been buoyed by ongoing bullish sentiment, maintaining an upward bias despite signs of overextension in the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Traders are advised to exercise caution as the overbought conditions may signal a potential pullback.

As the USD strengthens against the JPY, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could impact trading dynamics. The current exchange rate reflects a broader trend of dollar resilience, which is supported by favorable U.S. economic data. Investors will be keen to see if the upward trajectory can be sustained or if the overbought RSI will prompt a correction in the coming sessions.

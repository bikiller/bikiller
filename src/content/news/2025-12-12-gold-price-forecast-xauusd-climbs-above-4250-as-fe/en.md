Gold prices surged to seven-week highs, with XAU/USD climbing above $4,275 in early Asian trading on Friday. This increase comes on the heels of the US Federal Reserve's recent decision to implement a quarter-point rate cut, which has contributed to a notable weakening of the US Dollar (USD). As the Fed's actions ripple through the markets, traders are closely watching the dynamics between gold and the USD.

The rate cut has shifted the exchange rate landscape, making gold, traditionally seen as a safe-haven asset, more attractive to investors. With the USD under pressure, demand for gold is expected to rise further, potentially pushing prices even higher. The current market movement underscores the sensitivity of precious metals to monetary policy changes, and traders are keen to gauge the implications for both XAU/USD and broader currency pair valuations in the wake of this pivotal decision.

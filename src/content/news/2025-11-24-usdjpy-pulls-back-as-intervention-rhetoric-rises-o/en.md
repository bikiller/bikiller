The USD/JPY currency pair has experienced a pullback, with trading activity showing signs of slowing down as the exchange rate dipped to 156.76 levels on Friday. This decline comes amid increasing speculation regarding potential intervention by Japanese authorities to stabilize the yen, prompting traders to reassess their positions in the market.

The USD/CHF currency pair continued its downward trend, trading around 0.7960 during early European hours on Tuesday, marking the third consecutive day in negative territory. The Swiss Franc (CHF) has gained strength against the US Dollar (USD) as safe-haven demand rises in response to US President Donald Trump's recent tariff threats, creating uncertainty in the markets.

As geopolitical tensions escalate, investors are shifting their focus to the more stable Swiss Franc, driving the exchange rate lower for the USD/CHF pair. This increased demand for safe-haven assets highlights the ongoing volatility in global trading and may influence future currency movements as traders assess the implications of potential trade conflicts on economic stability.

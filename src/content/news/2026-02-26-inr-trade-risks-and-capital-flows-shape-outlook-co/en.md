Commerzbank analysts Charlie Lay and Moses Lim noted that the US Supreme Court’s recent ruling on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and a new US–India trade agreement have reduced average US tariffs on Indian exports. However, despite the favorable deal, trade uncertainty remains elevated, which continues to weigh on market sentiment. As a result, the USD/INR currency pair is likely to experience volatile fluctuations.

Furthermore, the analysts warn that rising oil prices and ongoing capital outflows could place additional downward pressure on the Indian Rupee. These factors contribute to an unstable outlook for INR, potentially exacerbating risks in the foreign exchange market. Traders should monitor these developments closely, as they could affect exchange rates and trading strategies for both the USD and INR.

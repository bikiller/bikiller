The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced notable gains against its major counterparts on Thursday, defying expectations amid a backdrop of dovish bets surrounding the Bank of England (BoE). GBP/USD traded at 1.3650, marking a 0.4% increase, while GBP/EUR also saw an uptick, reaching an exchange rate of 1.1600. The movement indicates a strong bullish sentiment in the market, despite prevailing concerns about BoE's monetary policy stance.

Analysts suggest that the recent rise in the pound can be attributed to a combination of robust economic data and investor adjustments following earlier bearish trends. This upward momentum in GBP could signal renewed confidence in the UK's economic recovery, prompting traders to reassess their positions. As forex markets react, the implications of these movements could influence trading strategies, particularly for those dealing in USD and EUR currency pairs, as they navigate the evolving landscape.

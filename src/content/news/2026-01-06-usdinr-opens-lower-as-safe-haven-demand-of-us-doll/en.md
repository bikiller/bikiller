The Indian Rupee (INR) opens higher against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, breaking a three-day losing streak. The USD/INR currency pair trades around 90.35 as market sentiment shifts, reflecting a decline in the safe-haven demand for the USD. This movement follows a notable drop in the US Dollar Index (DXY), which dipped sharply to a three-week low of 98.86 on Monday.

As traders reassess their positions, the declining DXY suggests a potential shift in market dynamics, influencing the exchange rate of INR. The strengthening of the Rupee could indicate increasing investor confidence in the Indian economy, potentially impacting trading flows and investment strategies in the region. Market participants will be closely monitoring these developments as they evaluate the implications for future currency movements.

The NZD/USD currency pair is experiencing continued losses, trading around 0.5760 during early European hours on Thursday. This marks a second consecutive session of decline for the New Zealand Dollar (NZD), which is under pressure despite recent data indicating stronger-than-expected economic growth in New Zealand. The exchange rate's drop reflects broader market dynamics as traders await critical US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.

As the trading day progresses, the anticipation surrounding the US CPI report could further impact the NZD/USD exchange rate. With the USD holding its ground amid expected inflation data, market participants remain cautious. A weak performance from the NZD against the USD could signal potential volatility ahead, compelling traders to adjust their positions in response to evolving economic indicators.

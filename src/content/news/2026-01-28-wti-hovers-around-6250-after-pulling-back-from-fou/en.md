WTI crude oil trades near $62.40–$62.50 per barrel during European trading hours on Wednesday, easing after a strong 2.86% rally in the previous session. Prices briefly touched a four-month high of $62.85 earlier in the day before modest profit-taking emerged. The pullback reflects short-term consolidation rather than a shift in broader market sentiment.

The earlier advance was fueled by persistent supply risks, which continue to underpin crude prices and influence commodity-linked trading strategies. A softer USD has also played a role, as movements in the exchange rate often affect dollar-denominated assets like oil. As the USD fluctuates against major currency pairs such as EUR/USD, energy prices remain sensitive to broader forex dynamics.

For traders, WTI holding above the $62.00 psychological level suggests underlying bullish momentum remains intact, despite the intraday dip. Elevated oil prices can have knock-on effects across FX markets, supporting currencies tied to energy exports while pressuring oil-importing economies. As trading continues, attention will stay on supply developments, USD direction, and overall risk appetite shaping both oil and forex markets.

The USD/INR currency pair continued its downward trend on Wednesday, with the Indian Rupee (INR) hitting a record low of approximately 90.30 in early trading. This marks the third consecutive day of losses for the INR, driven by growing concerns over India's escalating fiscal deficit and significant foreign capital outflows.

The increasing fiscal deficit has led investors to reevaluate their positions, prompting a sell-off that is weighing heavily on the Indian currency. As the exchange rate between the USD and INR continues to shift, market participants are closely monitoring the implications for India's economic stability and the potential for further depreciation of the Rupee.

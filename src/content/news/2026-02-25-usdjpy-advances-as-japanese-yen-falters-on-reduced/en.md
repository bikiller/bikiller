USD/JPY is trading at 156.30 on Wednesday, up 0.26% for the day, as the Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle against the US Dollar (USD). This marks an extension of the pair's recent rally, fueled by growing uncertainty over the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) future interest rate decisions. The Yen remains vulnerable, and the USD is gaining momentum in a shifting market.

The outlook for the BoJ's monetary tightening has become increasingly unclear, further weighing on JPY. The USD/JPY exchange rate is now at its highest levels in recent weeks, as traders adjust their positions amid concerns over BoJ policy divergence from the Federal Reserve. Market participants are closely monitoring any signs of a shift in Japan's interest rate stance, which could further influence the pair's movement in the near term.

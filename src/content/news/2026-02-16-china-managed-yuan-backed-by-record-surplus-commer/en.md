China's Q4 2025 current account surplus reached a record USD 242 billion, or 4.9% of GDP, according to Commerzbank's Volkmar Baur. This surplus, one of the largest in China's history, highlights the country's ongoing control over its currency. As a result, the Yuan (CNY) remains closely managed, preventing significant volatility in its exchange rate against the USD.

This robust surplus is expected to influence forex markets, especially the USD/CNY pair. Traders are likely to keep a close eye on the PBOC's interventions, which may limit the Yuan's fluctuations. Despite this, the surplus further underscores China's economic stability, potentially supporting the CNY in the short to medium term.

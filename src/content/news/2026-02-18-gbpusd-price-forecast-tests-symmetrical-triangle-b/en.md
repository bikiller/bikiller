The GBP/USD currency pair is trading flat around 1.3570 during the European session on Wednesday, as the market waits for further direction. Despite this consolidation, the British Pound (GBP) saw a slight upward movement following the release of the United Kingdom's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for January. The CPI came in slightly stronger than expected, providing some support for the GBP against the US Dollar (USD).

The technical outlook for GBP/USD shows the pair testing a key breakdown point near 1.3580, in line with a symmetrical triangle pattern on the charts. A failure to hold above this level could signal further downside risks, potentially pushing the exchange rate toward lower support levels. With the USD remaining resilient, any further weakness in the Pound could see the currency pair targeting 1.3500 or lower in the short term.

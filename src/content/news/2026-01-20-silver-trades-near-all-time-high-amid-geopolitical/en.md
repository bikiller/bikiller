Silver (XAG/USD) is experiencing significant upward momentum, trading around $95.50 on Tuesday, marking a 1.20% increase for the day. Earlier, the precious metal reached a new all-time high of $95.89, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions and a surge in safe-haven demand among investors.

The current exchange rate reflects heightened market anxiety, prompting traders to flock to silver as a protective asset. As global uncertainties persist, the demand for safe-haven commodities like silver is likely to remain strong, potentially influencing future price movements in the currency pair. Market participants will be closely watching developments that could further impact investor sentiment and trading strategies.

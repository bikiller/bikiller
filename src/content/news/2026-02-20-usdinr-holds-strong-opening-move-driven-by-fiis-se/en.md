The Indian Rupee (INR) maintained a steady decline against the US Dollar (USD) as the currency pair remained under pressure during afternoon trading on Friday. The INR opened lower, continuing its gap down and holding onto its losses despite early volatility. The exchange rate for USD/INR hovered around 83.25, driven by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) selling in India and global market dynamics.

Rising oil prices further exacerbated the Rupee's weakness, with crude oil prices increasing on supply concerns. This price surge led to a widening trade deficit, intensifying downward pressure on the INR. As a result, the USD/INR currency pair is expected to remain sensitive to both oil price movements and FII inflows.

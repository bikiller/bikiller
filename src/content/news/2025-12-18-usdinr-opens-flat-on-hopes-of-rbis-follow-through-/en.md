The Indian Rupee (INR) opened flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/INR currency pair trading around the 90.80 level. This stability comes as investors remain cautious, anticipating that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may step in again to bolster the rupee's value. 

Market sentiment is largely shaped by expectations of RBI intervention, which could influence trading dynamics and exchange rates in the short term. As traders monitor the situation, the potential for volatility remains, particularly if the RBI takes action to support the INR against ongoing external pressures.

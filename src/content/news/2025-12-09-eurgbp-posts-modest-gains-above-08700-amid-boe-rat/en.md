The EUR/GBP currency pair is experiencing modest gains, trading around 0.8735 during the early hours of European trading on Tuesday. This movement comes as the Pound Sterling (GBP) shows slight strength against the Euro (EUR), driven by market expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will implement interest rate cuts in its upcoming policy meeting.

The anticipation of a rate cut by the BoE is influencing trader sentiment, creating a cautious environment in the forex market. As the exchange rate hovers above the key level of 0.8700, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and central bank signals that could further impact the GBP's performance against the EUR. The ongoing adjustments reflect broader trends in currency trading as investors navigate potential shifts in monetary policy.

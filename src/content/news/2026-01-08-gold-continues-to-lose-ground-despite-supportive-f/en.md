Gold (XAU/USD) extended its downward trend for the second consecutive day, dropping to a three-day low near the $4,415 mark as the European session approaches on Thursday. This decline occurs despite a generally supportive fundamental backdrop, indicating a complex market dynamic affecting the precious metal's performance.

Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as fluctuations in the USD continue to influence gold prices. Growing market uncertainty may be contributing to the downward pressure on gold, highlighting the challenges the asset faces in maintaining upward momentum even amid favorable conditions. The ongoing trading patterns suggest that market participants remain cautious, weighing various economic indicators against their overall impact on the currency pair.

The AUD/USD currency pair has continued its downward correction, trading near 0.6690 during Thursday’s European session. This move follows the pair's recent peak at 0.6766, marking its highest level in over a year. The decline in the exchange rate can be attributed to a narrowing of Australia's Trade Balance, which has added pressure on the Australian dollar.

As traders digest the implications of the latest trade data, the outlook for the AUD/USD remains uncertain. A sustained move below the 0.6700 level could indicate further bearish sentiment, while any rebound may hinge on upcoming economic indicators. The dynamics of the currency pair will be closely watched as market participants assess the impact of global economic conditions and central bank policies on the Australian dollar against the USD.

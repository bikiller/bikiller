The Japanese Yen (JPY) gained momentum at the start of the week, driven by robust wage growth that has heightened expectations for a potential Bank of Japan (BoJ) interest rate hike. This resurgence brought the JPY close to its highest exchange rate against the US Dollar (USD) since November 14, as traders sought to capitalize on the Yen's strength amidst a softer USD.

As the market reacted, the JPY experienced notable dip-buying, indicating a strong bullish sentiment among investors. The favorable economic outlook for Japan could influence trading patterns, with analysts closely monitoring the USD/JPY pair for further signs of movement. With wage growth supporting the Yen, any shifts in BoJ policy could lead to increased volatility in currency pairs involving the JPY, reinforcing its position in the forex market.

The Pound Sterling saw a sharp decline against its major peers during the European session on Monday following dovish remarks from Bank of England (BoE) Monetary Policy Committee member Alan Taylor. Speaking at a Deutsche Bank event in London, Taylor suggested that interest rates could stay lower for longer, raising concerns among traders. As a result, GBP/USD dropped to 1.2040, losing around 0.8%, while GBP/EUR fell to 1.1340.

The dovish outlook dampened investor sentiment, contributing to increased selling pressure on the British currency. The shift in expectations for rate hikes from the BoE weighed heavily on GBP, with the currency pair facing significant resistance at the 1.2100 level. Analysts are now closely watching further comments from BoE officials for clues on the future direction of the exchange rate, as the Sterling struggles to regain footing amidst global economic uncertainty.

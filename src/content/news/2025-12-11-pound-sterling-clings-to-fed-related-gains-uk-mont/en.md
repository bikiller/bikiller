Pound Sterling (GBP) is showing a cautious stance against major currencies as it retains gains attributed to the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut. Traders are closely watching the GBP/USD exchange rate, which remains influenced by investor sentiment. The upcoming release of UK monthly GDP data is adding to the market's anticipation ahead of next week’s Bank of England (BoE) decision.

As the market prepares for these economic indicators, the GBP is trading in a tight range against the euro (EUR/GBP) and the US dollar (GBP/USD). The exchange rate dynamics are reflective of both Federal Reserve policies and the UK’s economic outlook, leading to potential volatility. Investors are keenly aware that the forthcoming GDP figures could significantly impact the BoE's monetary policy stance, influencing GBP's performance across the board.

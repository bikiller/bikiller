Eurozone inflation data for January showed a slowdown, with the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) easing to 1.7% year-on-year, down from 1.9% in December, meeting market expectations. Core inflation also dropped to 2.2%, reflecting ongoing pressure on the European Central Bank (ECB) to address inflation levels that remain below its target. The EUR/USD exchange rate saw modest fluctuations, as traders digested the data ahead of the ECB's upcoming meeting.

Despite the softer inflation figures, the ECB is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold. This comes as concerns over inflation undershooting the 2% target continue to weigh on the central bank’s monetary policy stance. Market sentiment has shifted, and the EUR is likely to remain under pressure against the USD unless there is a clear indication of further tightening from the ECB. With the current outlook, EUR/USD trading is expected to be largely influenced by developments in the Eurozone’s economic recovery and the global inflationary environment.

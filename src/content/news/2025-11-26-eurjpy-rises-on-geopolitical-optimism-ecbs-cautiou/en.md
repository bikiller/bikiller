EUR/JPY is trading higher on Wednesday, currently around 181.30, reflecting a 0.40% increase. This uptick in the currency pair comes amid improving risk sentiment, as investors react to political developments suggesting potential progress toward a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. Such optimism is fostering a more favorable trading environment for the euro against the yen.

Additionally, the European Central Bank's cautious optimism has further supported the euro's strength. As traders remain vigilant, the exchange rate could experience volatility based on upcoming geopolitical news and economic indicators. The interplay between these factors continues to influence market dynamics, highlighting the importance of geopolitical developments in forex trading.

EUR/USD saw a modest decline during the North American session, reaching a daily low of 1.1804 before recovering slightly to 1.1845, down 0.07%. The pullback occurred amid a risk-off sentiment that boosted the US Dollar, as heightened tensions between the US and Iran kept market participants on edge. The geopolitical uncertainty overshadowed broader market trends, contributing to the dip in the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Despite this pullback, the currency pair remains relatively firm, supported by the ongoing hawkish tone from the Federal Reserve. The Fed's stance on tightening rates has kept the US Dollar resilient, providing some upside for the Greenback. As of now, the EUR/USD continues to face headwinds from both political tensions and diverging monetary policies between the Fed and the European Central Bank.

Gold (XAU/USD) surged past $5,000 on Friday, gaining momentum after a flat trading session the previous day. The increase was driven by rising tensions between the United States and Iran, which boosted demand for safe-haven assets. As geopolitical risks intensify, gold prices are supported by concerns surrounding potential instability in the Middle East.

Meanwhile, the focus in global markets shifts to upcoming US economic data, particularly the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index and GDP figures. These reports could influence the USD's exchange rate and provide fresh insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction. Traders are keenly watching for any signs of economic slowdown or inflationary pressures that could impact the US dollar's value.

EUR/JPY has reclaimed its bullish momentum, rising to 185.25 from a session low of 184.40. The euro is gaining strength as the Japanese yen weakens, driven by market sentiment ahead of Japan's snap elections this weekend. This recovery comes after the yen's recent struggles against its major peers, impacting its performance in the forex market.

The current price movement reflects investor uncertainty, with traders adjusting positions as the elections approach. The yen's decline against the euro and other currencies highlights concerns over political developments in Japan. With the EUR/JPY pair testing key technical levels, further fluctuations are expected, depending on the election outcome and any resulting shifts in investor confidence.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) have dropped to approximately $91.80 during Thursday's Asian trading session, reflecting a decline in safe-haven demand. This downturn follows a period of record highs, as traders react to easing tariff threats that had previously bolstered the metal's appeal. The profit booking activity further contributed to the downward pressure on the white metal.

As the market shifts its focus away from protective assets, the exchange rate for silver has come under scrutiny. Investors are now reassessing their positions, particularly in light of changing geopolitical dynamics and the strengthening U.S. dollar (USD). The current price movement signals potential volatility ahead, as market participants weigh economic indicators and look for new catalysts that could influence the currency pair in the coming days.

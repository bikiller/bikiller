Gold prices steadied above the $4,800 mark on Thursday as traders adjusted positions ahead of a crucial batch of US economic data due later in the day. At the time of writing, XAU/USD was trading at $4,827, having bounced back after briefly dipping below the psychological $4,800 level. This movement comes amid a pause in broader market trends, as investors await fresh economic signals.

The upcoming US data, including key inflation and employment reports, has traders on edge, with potential implications for the USD and broader market sentiment. The near-term outlook for XAU/USD remains hinged on these releases, with volatility likely to increase based on the strength or weakness of the US economic figures. A stronger-than-expected report could boost the USD, pressuring gold, while disappointing data may support the precious metal.

The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is expected to trade within a range of 0.5760 to 0.5800 against the US Dollar (USD), according to UOB Group’s FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. This trading range suggests a period of consolidation for the currency pair as market participants assess broader economic conditions.

While a pullback in the NZD is anticipated, analysts indicate any further declines will likely encounter robust support at the 0.5720 level. This support could provide a foundation for potential recovery, influencing trading decisions and positioning in the forex market as traders weigh the implications of these technical levels on future exchange rate movements.

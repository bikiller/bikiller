AUD/JPY is maintaining its upward momentum, trading around the 103.00 level in the Asian session on Friday. This marks the third consecutive session of gains for the currency pair, driven by the recent policy decision from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The BoJ's stance seems to have bolstered investor confidence, influencing the exchange rate positively.

Market analysts are closely watching the AUD/JPY as it continues to hold above the key psychological level of 103.00. The sustained strength of the Australian dollar against the yen reflects underlying trends in the forex market, particularly as traders assess broader economic indicators and central bank policies. Any fluctuations in this pair could signal shifts in investor sentiment and risk appetite in the coming sessions.

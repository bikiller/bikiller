Gold (XAU/USD) remains subdued below its record high as traders await crucial U.S. PCE data for fresh market direction. Following a modest recovery from the $4,773-4,772 range on Thursday, gold struggles to maintain upward momentum, reflecting cautious sentiment in the trading community. The precious metal's recent peak, achieved just a day earlier, continues to act as a barrier for bullish traders.

Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators, particularly the upcoming PCE data, which could significantly influence the USD's exchange rate against other currencies like the EUR. Any surprises in the figures might prompt shifts in trading strategies, potentially reigniting interest in gold as a hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.

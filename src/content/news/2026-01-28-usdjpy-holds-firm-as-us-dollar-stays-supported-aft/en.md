The USD/JPY currency pair continues to hold firm, with the US Dollar remaining supported after the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates unchanged. As of mid-Wednesday trading, the pair is consolidating near the 153.92 mark, reflecting a nearly 1% gain on the day. This move highlights the ongoing strength of the USD against the Japanese Yen, which remains under pressure in the face of a stable monetary policy outlook from the Fed.

The decision to maintain rates has reinforced confidence in the US Dollar, further solidifying its position against other major currencies, including the Yen. Market participants are closely monitoring any signals from upcoming economic data or future Fed policy adjustments that could influence the USD/JPY exchange rate. For now, the pair seems poised to maintain its upward momentum, with key support levels around the 153.90 zone.

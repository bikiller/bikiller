The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is expected to experience limited movement against the US Dollar (USD), with analysts from UOB Group predicting the currency pair will trade within a narrow range of 0.5725 to 0.5755. This subdued price action suggests a lack of fresh catalysts in the market, leaving traders to navigate this consolidation phase.

Looking ahead, FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia indicate that the NZD may continue to fluctuate within a broader range of 0.5720 to 0.5805 in the near term. Market participants will be closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could influence the exchange rate and affect trading sentiment surrounding the NZD/USD pair.

WTI Crude Oil prices have rebounded from a brief dip below the $66.00 mark during the Asian session, climbing back towards the highest levels since August 4. As of Friday, prices have been hovering above mid-$66.00, driven by escalating tensions between the US and Iran. This increase comes amid heightened geopolitical risks, which have bolstered investor demand for safe-haven assets, including crude.

The price movement has placed WTI near a six-month high, reflecting market concerns about potential disruptions to global oil supply. The US dollar (USD) remains under pressure, influencing the broader forex market. The rising oil prices have contributed to volatility in currency pairs, especially those linked to energy exports, while the EUR/USD and GBP/USD remain sensitive to the shifting risk sentiment. Traders will closely monitor further developments in the US-Iran relationship for clues on the direction of oil prices in the coming weeks.

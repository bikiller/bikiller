The EUR/USD currency pair is holding steady around 1.1850 on Monday, after suffering a notable decline of over 1% last Friday. The Euro's lack of movement signals consolidation in a risk-off market environment, as traders remain cautious ahead of a busy economic calendar. The pair’s current price reflects broader market sentiment, with investors avoiding riskier assets amidst global uncertainties.

With a packed week of economic data releases, the outlook for EUR/USD could shift dramatically. As market participants eye key reports, including US jobs data and Eurozone economic indicators, volatility could rise. The Euro’s relative weakness against the US Dollar, coupled with the ongoing risk-off sentiment, suggests that any positive surprises may not be enough to push the currency pair higher in the short term.

NZD/USD continued its downward trend for the second consecutive day, trading around 0.5730 during the Asian session on Wednesday. The currency pair has struggled to maintain levels above the critical 0.5750 threshold, reflecting ongoing market concerns. 

The losses come ahead of anticipated trade data from China, which could further influence the exchange rate dynamics of the New Zealand dollar against the US dollar. Traders remain cautious, monitoring developments that may impact the NZD's performance in the forex market in the coming sessions.

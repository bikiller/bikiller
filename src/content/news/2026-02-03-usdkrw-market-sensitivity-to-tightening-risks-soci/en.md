The USD/KRW currency pair has drawn attention after the January Bank of Korea MPC minutes hinted at a shift toward a more hawkish policy bias. Societe Generale notes that markets are becoming increasingly sensitive to tightening risks, even as the exchange rate has edged lower. In FX trading, this evolving tone has kept the Korean won responsive to policy signals from the BoK and broader USD dynamics.

Despite the firmer rhetoric, the minutes underline that the Committee remains unconvinced by recent data. A lower USD/KRW exchange rate and rising domestic property prices send mixed messages, offering neither a clear inflation threat nor a strong case for immediate tightening. As a result, policymakers appear cautious, balancing growth risks against financial stability concerns in a volatile global FX environment dominated by USD and EUR flows.

For traders, the implication is continued two-way risk in USD/KRW rather than a decisive trend. Market positioning is likely to stay light as participants assess whether hawkish signals translate into action. Until clearer evidence emerges, the currency pair may continue to trade on shifts in global USD sentiment, regional risk appetite, and incremental guidance from the BoK rather than firm domestic triggers.

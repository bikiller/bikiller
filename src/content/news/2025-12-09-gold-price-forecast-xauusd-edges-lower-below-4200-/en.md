Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a downturn, trading around $4,195 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. The precious metal's decline comes amidst rising concerns regarding the US Federal Reserve's potential hawkish stance in its upcoming rhetoric, despite the anticipation of a rate cut on Wednesday. This sentiment has led to a cautious trading environment for gold investors.

As market participants digest the implications of the Fed's actions on the broader economic landscape, fluctuations in the exchange rate are expected. A hawkish tone could strengthen the USD against other currencies, including the EUR, driving further pressure on gold prices. Traders will closely monitor the Fed's meeting for insights into future monetary policy directions and their impact on precious metals markets.

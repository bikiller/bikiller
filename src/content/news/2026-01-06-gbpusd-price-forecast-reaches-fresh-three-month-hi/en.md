GBP/USD has surged to fresh three-month highs, trading around 1.3560 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This marks a continuation of its upward momentum for the second consecutive day. The strong performance reflects a bullish sentiment in the market, driven by positive economic indicators and a weaker USD, which has bolstered the exchange rate of this key currency pair.

Technical analysis reveals a persistent bullish bias, with the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) recently hitting 69.29, approaching overbought territory. Traders should remain vigilant as the GBP/USD exchange rate continues to test these elevated levels, with potential implications for future trading strategies. The outlook for the pair remains optimistic, contingent on ongoing economic developments and market sentiment surrounding the USD and GBP.

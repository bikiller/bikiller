Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing mixed trading against major currencies as market sentiment grows increasingly cautious. The exchange rate reflects mounting expectations that the Bank of England (BoE) will cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75% in its upcoming policy meeting. This speculation is weighing on the GBP, particularly against the USD and EUR, leading to fluctuations in currency pairs.

As traders adjust positions ahead of the anticipated BoE decision, the GBP/USD pair is under pressure, while the GBP/EUR remains volatile. With the looming rate cut, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators to gauge the potential impact on the pound’s value. This uncertainty may prompt further adjustments in trading strategies as the market anticipates the BoE's next moves and their implications for the broader forex landscape.

The EUR/USD currency pair has surged by 0.36%, reaching nearly 1.1900 during the Asian session on Monday. This marks a near four-year high for the pair, with prices approaching 1.1920. The strengthening of the euro is primarily driven by the ongoing weakness in the US Dollar, which continues its decline from last week. 

Traders are positioning themselves ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday, contributing to cautious sentiment in the markets. The Fed's decision could significantly impact the USD, as investors closely monitor any signals regarding interest rates or economic outlook. The EUR/USD exchange rate remains sensitive to these developments, with potential volatility on the horizon.

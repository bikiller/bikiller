EUR/USD continued its downward trend on Wednesday, marking the sixth consecutive day of losses as the currency pair traded below the 1.1740 level. This decline follows a brief rally last week when the pair surged above the 1.1800 mark. The recent movement reflects a moderate rebound in the US Dollar (USD), prompted by the release of the December Federal Reserve Monetary Policy Meeting minutes.

The market's thin trading conditions typical of the year-end period have amplified volatility in the EUR/USD exchange rate. Traders are adjusting their positions ahead of the holiday season, leading to a cautious sentiment. The implications of the Fed's minutes suggest a potential shift in monetary policy, contributing to the USD's strength and pressuring the euro against the dollar in this current trading environment.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) have stabilized near their all-time high of $95.90 during the early European trading session on Wednesday. The market is currently in a consolidation phase as traders remain cautious ahead of a highly anticipated speech by U.S. President Donald Trump at the World Economic Forum in Davos, set for 13:00 GMT. This event could influence market sentiment and the direction of the currency pair.

As investors await potential insights from Trump, the silver market reflects a broader risk sentiment impacting the USD exchange rate. The white metal's proximity to its historical peak suggests robust demand, which may be influenced by macroeconomic factors and geopolitical developments. Any significant remarks from Trump could lead to volatility in both silver and related currency pairs, affecting trading strategies in the precious metals market.

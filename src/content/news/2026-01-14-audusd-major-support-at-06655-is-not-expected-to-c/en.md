The Australian Dollar (AUD) is poised to test the 0.6670 level against the US Dollar (USD), with major support at 0.6655 unlikely to be breached, according to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. The current price action suggests that AUD/USD is undergoing a range-trading phase, oscillating between 0.6655 and 0.6745.

As the market digests recent economic data, traders are focusing on potential movements within this range. The lack of expected downward pressure at 0.6655 implies that the AUD may maintain its footing against the USD in the near term, providing opportunities for traders to capitalize on fluctuations within this established range.

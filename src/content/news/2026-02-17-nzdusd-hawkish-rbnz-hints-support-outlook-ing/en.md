The NZD/USD pair remains supported as the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) signals a hawkish stance ahead of its upcoming policy decision on February 18. ING’s FX strategist Francesco Pesole predicts the RBNZ will maintain current rates but revise both inflation and policy rate forecasts higher, reinforcing expectations of further tightening. This shift in projections has bolstered the New Zealand dollar’s outlook.

As the currency pair holds firm, the NZD/USD exchange rate benefits from the market’s anticipation of tighter monetary policy. The hawkish signals are seen as a counterbalance to recent USD strength, with investors looking to position for possible rate hikes. Should the RBNZ follow through on its projections, the NZD could continue to strengthen, potentially challenging key technical resistance levels.

USD/CHF continues to trend lower, with the pair falling back below the 0.77 mark as sellers remain active in search of a floor. The currency pair has been under pressure since November 2025, consistently forming lower highs and lower lows. The exchange rate is currently trading well beneath key technical levels, including the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.7882 and the 200 EMA at 0.8125, reinforcing the bearish outlook.

As traders monitor the USD/CHF's downward trajectory, attention is focused on potential support levels. The pair’s failure to regain ground above the 50 and 200 EMAs suggests further downside risks. A sustained decline could push the exchange rate towards key psychological levels, while any reversal might require significant bullish momentum to break the current trend.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing upward momentum against major currency pairs on Wednesday, buoyed by the recent relief rally following the UK budget announcement. The GBP/USD exchange rate reflects this trend, trading higher as investors react positively to fiscal measures that hint at potential support for the economy. Meanwhile, the GBP/EUR pair also shows strength, indicating a broader recovery against the euro.

Despite a firm dovish stance from the Bank of England, which has prompted speculation of further rate cuts, the pound's resilience points to a temporary shift in market sentiment. This optimism may impact trading strategies as traders weigh potential risks against the backdrop of the central bank's cautious approach. All eyes will remain on upcoming economic indicators to gauge whether the pound can sustain its gains against the USD and EUR in the near term.

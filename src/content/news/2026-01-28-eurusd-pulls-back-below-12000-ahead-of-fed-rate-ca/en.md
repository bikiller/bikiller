EUR/USD trades softer on Wednesday, pulling back below the 1.2000 exchange rate as the USD attempts a modest rebound. The currency pair loses momentum ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision scheduled for 19:00 GMT, with traders reducing exposure. The pullback reflects cautious trading conditions rather than a decisive shift in broader EUR or USD sentiment.

In the forex market, the US Dollar firms slightly as participants position for potential guidance from the Fed. While no immediate policy change is expected, uncertainty around future rate signals keeps USD demand supported. This dynamic pressures the euro, limiting upside in the EUR/USD pair and encouraging short-term profit-taking near the 1.2000 technical level.

From a trading perspective, the inability to hold above 1.2000 highlights the importance of this psychological threshold for near-term direction. A sustained move below could open room for deeper consolidation, while a recovery would suggest resilience in the euro. Until the Fed decision clarifies the outlook, the currency pair is likely to remain range-bound, with volatility driven by USD reactions.

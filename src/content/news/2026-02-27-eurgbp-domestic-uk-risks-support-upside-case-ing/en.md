The EUR/GBP currency pair has gained support from domestic political risks in the UK, as concerns over the country’s political landscape and policy uncertainties weigh on the Pound. ING’s Francesco Pesole highlighted that these developments are bolstering the case for a stronger Euro. As the exchange rate continues to reflect market sentiment, EUR/GBP traders are eyeing further potential upside, especially amid increasing volatility.

The Pound remains vulnerable to UK risks, which could further tilt market dynamics in favor of the Euro.

The ongoing uncertainty around UK policies continues to influence the currency pair, supporting a bullish outlook for EUR/GBP in the short term.

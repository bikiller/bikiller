TD Securities commodity strategists foresee a renewed bullish outlook for gold, driven by several key factors. With the Federal Reserve's dovish stance continuing, alongside a persistent core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index hovering near 3%, gold prices could break new records. The combination of these monetary dynamics and ongoing currency debasement pressures are expected to propel gold toward a potential price target of $5,700 per ounce.

This forecast reflects broader market implications, particularly for USD-based assets. As the US dollar faces depreciation due to softening Fed policies, gold is increasingly seen as a safe haven. Investors may seek to hedge against inflation and currency risks, boosting demand for gold. In the forex market, these developments could influence currency pairs, especially USD/EUR, with traders closely monitoring shifts in interest rates and economic indicators.

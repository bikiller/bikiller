Japan's upcoming election is raising concerns among traders regarding its potential impact on the nation's economy and bond markets. Analysts from ING, including Min Joo Kang, Chris Turner, and Padhraic Garvey, highlight that election outcomes could shape fiscal policies and influence investor sentiment. The Japanese Yen (JPY) is facing pressure, with USD/JPY trading around ¥130.00, reflecting ongoing market jitters about future government actions.

In addition, the bond market is seeing volatility as traders price in the possibility of policy shifts. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield is closely watched, with any change in direction likely to affect both the JPY and broader market sentiment. EUR/JPY has also seen movement, as the Eurozone's stability contrasts Japan's uncertain fiscal outlook. The election's results could determine the trajectory of the JPY, with key technical levels set at ¥128.50 for support and ¥132.00 for resistance.

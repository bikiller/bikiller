Silver (XAG/USD) has experienced a sharp decline, dropping over $10 from its recent peak of nearly $86.00, reached on Monday. As of the latest trading session, the precious metal is fluctuating around the $74.00 mark. This significant retreat follows comments from US President Trump regarding the likelihood of a peace deal in Ukraine, which has influenced market sentiment.

As XAG/USD continues to navigate through this volatile landscape, investors are closely monitoring how exchange rates may respond to ongoing political dynamics and economic indicators.

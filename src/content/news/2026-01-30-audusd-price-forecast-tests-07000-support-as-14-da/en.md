The AUD/USD currency pair eased on Friday after posting three consecutive days of gains, slipping back toward the 0.7000 exchange rate during early European trading hours. Despite the pullback, the pair remains within an ascending channel on the daily chart, suggesting the broader bullish structure is still intact. Short-term trading, however, shows signs of fatigue as buyers hesitate near key psychological levels.

Technical indicators highlight growing caution for AUD/USD traders. The 14-day Relative Strength Index is hovering in overbought territory, signaling that upside momentum may be overstretched in the near term. The 0.7000 level now acts as immediate support, while a sustained break below it could expose the currency pair to deeper consolidation, potentially toward lower channel support.

From a market perspective, the recent pause reflects profit-taking rather than a clear reversal, with the Australian dollar still supported by overall risk sentiment against the USD. If the exchange rate holds above 0.7000, bullish traders may look for renewed buying interest. Conversely, a drop below this level could shift focus toward corrective moves amid broader USD and EUR trading dynamics.

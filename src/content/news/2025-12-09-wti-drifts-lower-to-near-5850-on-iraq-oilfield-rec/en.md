West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have slipped to approximately $58.65 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, reflecting a decline driven by the restoration of production in Iraq. As the country resumes operations at one of its key oilfields, traders are adjusting their positions, impacting the overall market dynamics.

The drop in WTI prices may have broader implications for currency pairs like USD/EUR, as fluctuations in oil prices often influence global exchange rates. Investors will be closely monitoring the situation in Iraq and its potential effect on the supply landscape, which could lead to further volatility in oil-related currencies and commodities.

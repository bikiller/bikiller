Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to an unprecedented high of approximately $5,045 during early trading in Asia on Monday. This significant increase reflects a growing appetite for safe-haven assets amid escalating geopolitical tensions. Investors are increasingly drawn to gold as a hedge against uncertainty, driving the precious metal's exchange rate to record levels.

The rise in gold comes alongside heightened concerns regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy, which has left traders wary of potential impacts on the USD. As geopolitical risks loom large, market participants continue to pivot toward gold, reinforcing its status as a preferred store of value in volatile times. With prices now at an all-time high, the market outlook remains bullish for XAU/USD as traders respond to ongoing uncertainties.

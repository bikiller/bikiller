The US Dollar Index (DXY) is witnessing a notable upswing, trading around 99.50 during the Asian session on Monday. This marks the second consecutive day of gains for the index, which gauges the dollar's performance against a basket of six major currencies. The rise comes amid diminishing expectations for an imminent Federal Reserve rate cut, bolstering confidence in the USD.

As traders adjust their positions, the DXY's movement reflects a shift in sentiment that could impact various currency pairs. The euro (EUR) and other major currencies are feeling the pressure as the dollar strengthens, potentially influencing exchange rates in the coming days. With the index nearing the key 99.50 threshold, market participants will closely monitor any developments from the Fed that could further sway trading dynamics.

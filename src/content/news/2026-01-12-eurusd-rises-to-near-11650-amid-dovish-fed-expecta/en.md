EUR/USD continued its upward momentum, trading around 1.1650 during the Asian session on Monday, marking its seventh consecutive day of gains. The currency pair has appreciated significantly as the US Dollar (USD) faces downward pressure amid expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve.

The market sentiment has shifted, favoring the Euro (EUR) as traders anticipate that the Fed may adopt a more cautious approach in its monetary policy. This outlook is contributing to the ongoing strength of the EUR/USD exchange rate, with investors closely monitoring developments that could influence the trajectory of the USD in the days ahead.

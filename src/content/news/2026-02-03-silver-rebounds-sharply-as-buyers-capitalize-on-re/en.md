Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a significant rebound on Tuesday, surging to around $85.30. The precious metal gained approximately 6.50% during the day, driven by increased buying activity following a recent pullback. Market participants appear to be seizing the opportunity to enter at a lower price point, fueling the sharp recovery.

This move comes amid broader market fluctuations, with the USD showing some weakness against other major currencies. Traders are closely monitoring the price action of XAG/USD for potential further gains, especially as silver finds technical support at current levels. The strong bounce could signal renewed bullish sentiment, with traders looking for a continuation of upward momentum in the coming sessions.

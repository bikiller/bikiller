The AUD/USD currency pair is trading higher, approaching the 0.6710 mark during the European session on Tuesday. The Australian Dollar is gaining traction as traders react to indications that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) may tighten its monetary policy by 2026. This expectation is driving demand for the Aussie, reflecting a bullish sentiment in the market.

As the focus shifts to the upcoming FOMC minutes, traders are keen to gauge the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates, which could influence the USD's performance. The current exchange rate suggests a resilient Aussie, even amidst broader market volatility, highlighting the dynamic interplay of monetary policies between the RBA and the Fed.

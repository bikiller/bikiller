The Indian Rupee (INR) has remained largely unchanged against the US Dollar (USD) in early Thursday trading, with the USD/INR pair hovering near the 91.00 mark. This sideways movement reflects investor caution as market participants await further clarity on the US trade policy, which has created a sense of uncertainty in global currency markets.

With the USD/INR range-bound around key technical levels, traders are closely monitoring developments in US trade talks, which could influence future exchange rate movements. A lack of decisive direction in the currency pair underscores the market's uncertainty, leaving the INR vulnerable to potential volatility depending on geopolitical and policy shifts in the coming sessions.

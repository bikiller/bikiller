The USD/JPY pair slipped below the 153.00 mark on Thursday, as the Japanese Yen extended its gains for a fourth consecutive session. The Yen’s rise followed Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s strong general election win on February 8, which granted her a clear mandate to pursue expansionary fiscal policies. This development has bolstered confidence in the Yen's strength.

As USD/JPY dropped under key support at 153.00, traders are closely monitoring the impact of Japan’s shifting fiscal stance. With the prospect of more aggressive economic stimulus, the Japanese currency has remained resilient against the Dollar, signaling potential continued pressure on the pair in the coming sessions. The Yen’s momentum reflects broader market sentiment and potential shifts in monetary policy.

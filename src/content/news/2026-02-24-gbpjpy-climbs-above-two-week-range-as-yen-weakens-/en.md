The GBP/JPY currency pair surged above its two-week trading range on Tuesday, driven by a weakening yen. The exchange rate pushed higher as investors reacted to concerns raised by Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi regarding further interest rate hikes. In a meeting with Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda last week, Takaichi highlighted the risks of continuing aggressive monetary tightening, weighing on the yen.

The yen's broader weakness follows speculation that Japan may refrain from additional rate increases in the near term, despite global inflationary pressures. This has added to volatility in the currency pair, with GBP/JPY now trading at levels not seen in over two weeks. As the market awaits further comments from BoJ officials, traders are closely monitoring the direction of the yen, which remains sensitive to any shifts in Japan’s economic policy stance.

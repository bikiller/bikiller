European natural gas prices have surged amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, raising concerns over disruptions in global LNG trade. ING analysts point to the heightened risks, with European storage levels significantly below the five-year average. This geopolitical instability, coupled with tight supply, has pushed prices higher, impacting the EUR/USD exchange rate and broader market sentiment.

In addition to Middle East uncertainties, US storage levels are a key factor in the market’s volatility. With inventory levels well below historical norms, traders are closely monitoring the situation, as it could further influence natural gas prices. The dynamic has also led to fluctuating trading volumes in energy commodities, with the USD gaining ground in response to increased risk aversion in global markets.

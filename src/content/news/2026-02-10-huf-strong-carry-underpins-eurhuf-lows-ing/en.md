Trading in Central and Eastern European currencies remained subdued, with EUR/PLN and EUR/CZK maintaining their usual ranges. However, the EUR/HUF currency pair saw significant movement, breaking to a two-year low below the 377 level. This decline highlights ongoing strength in Hungary's carry trade, with investors continuing to favor the higher yields offered by the forint.

The recent drop in EUR/HUF can be attributed to a combination of quiet market conditions and the enduring attractiveness of Hungary's interest rate differentials. While other regional currencies remained stable, the forint's performance against the euro signals ongoing investor confidence in Hungary’s economic outlook and monetary policy.

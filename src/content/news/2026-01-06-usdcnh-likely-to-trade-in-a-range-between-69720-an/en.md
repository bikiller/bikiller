The USD/CNH is expected to trade within a narrow range of 6.9720 to 6.9920, according to analysts at UOB Group. This projection highlights a stable trading environment for the US Dollar against the Chinese Yuan, as both currencies navigate current market conditions. The analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, note that the exchange rate is experiencing deeply oversold conditions, limiting the potential for significant downward movement.

In the longer term, market dynamics suggest that the USD's downside risk may be capped around the 6.9590 level. With waning momentum and technical indicators supporting this view, traders should monitor these key levels closely. As the currency pair fluctuates within this range, its performance will be influenced by broader economic factors and market sentiment, particularly in relation to the USD's strength against other major currencies like the EUR.

The GBP/JPY currency pair has gained 0.35% as the Japanese Yen continues to weaken, trading at 205.64 after hitting a low of 204.94. Despite attempts by Japanese authorities to stabilize the Yen, the currency remains under pressure, allowing the British Pound to strengthen in this exchange rate.

This upward movement in GBP/JPY reflects broader trends in the forex market, with traders responding to the ongoing volatility of the Yen. As the currency pair tests the 206.00 level, market participants will closely monitor any further interventions from Japanese officials, which could impact trading dynamics in the coming sessions.

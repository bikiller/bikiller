The USD/INR currency pair opens the last trading day of 2025 flat, hovering around the exchange rate of 90.20. Amidst thin trading volumes globally, market participants are holding their positions as the year draws to a close. This lack of volatility reflects a cautious sentiment among traders as they assess the economic landscape and the outlook for the Indian Rupee against the US Dollar.

As the final trading session unfolds, the stability of the USD/INR pair suggests a wait-and-see approach from investors. With limited activity in the forex market, traders are likely to keep an eye on potential developments in the upcoming year that could influence currency dynamics. The performance of the Indian Rupee in 2026 may depend on various factors, including macroeconomic data releases and shifts in US monetary policy.

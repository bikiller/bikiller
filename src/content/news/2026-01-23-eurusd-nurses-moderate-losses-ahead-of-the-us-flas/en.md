EUR/USD is currently trading just above the 1.1730 level on Friday, nursing moderate losses after pulling back slightly from Thursday's gains. Despite this, the currency pair remains on track for its strongest weekly performance since June. The euro has maintained resilience against the USD, holding onto much of the prior day's strength ahead of key economic data.

Market participants are eyeing the upcoming US flash PMIs for fresh direction. The exchange rate's movement suggests traders are cautious ahead of these data points, with the USD holding steady against a broadly stable euro. The 1.1730 level has become a key support zone for EUR/USD, with any significant break below it likely to invite further selling pressure.

The Indian Rupee (INR) continued its decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, marking the fourth consecutive trading day of losses. The USD/INR currency pair strengthened amid ongoing selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian stock market. This consistent outflow has contributed to the INR's depreciation, pushing the exchange rate to new levels in a challenging trading environment.

As the rupee falters, market participants are closely monitoring the broader implications for the Indian economy. The relentless FIIs selling has raised concerns about the potential impact on domestic equities and overall investor sentiment. With the USD/INR pairing reflecting this trend, traders are adjusting their strategies, keeping an eye on technical levels and economic indicators that could signal a reversal or further decline in the rupee's value.

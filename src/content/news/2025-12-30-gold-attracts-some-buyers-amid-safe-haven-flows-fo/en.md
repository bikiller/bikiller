Gold prices (XAU/USD) are showing signs of recovery, trading above $4,350 during early European hours on Tuesday. This uptick comes after a significant decline of 4.5% in the previous session, marking gold's largest single-day loss since October. The recent pullback has attracted safe-haven buyers seeking stability amid market volatility.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming FOMC Minutes, which could provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction. As traders assess potential interest rate changes, fluctuations in the USD may further influence the gold market. The interplay between the currency pair dynamics and safe-haven demand suggests that gold remains a focal point for investors navigating uncertain economic conditions.

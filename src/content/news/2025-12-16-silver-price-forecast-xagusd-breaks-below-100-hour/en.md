Silver (XAG/USD) faced selling pressure during the Asian session on Tuesday, moving decisively below the critical 100-hour Simple Moving Average support around $62.50. This decline represents a reversal of the previous day's bullish momentum, as silver prices retreated from recent record highs to the mid-$62.00s, reflecting a loss of over 2.5% for the day.

The shift in momentum can be attributed to broader market dynamics and potential shifts in trader sentiment regarding the USD. As investors reassess their positions, the silver market's reaction may signal a trend shift, affecting future trading strategies for those involved in the currency pair. With the exchange rate under pressure, traders will be closely monitoring the situation for further implications on silver's performance and its correlation with the broader forex market.

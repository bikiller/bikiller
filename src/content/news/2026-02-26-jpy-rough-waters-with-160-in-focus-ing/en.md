The Japanese Yen has faced significant pressure recently, with concerns raised by PM Takaichi over potential future rate hikes and the appointment of perceived dovish members to the Bank of Japan. These factors have added volatility to JPY trading, with the currency pair USD/JPY testing the critical 160 level. This development has led to shifts in market sentiment, though ING maintains its view of a gradual policy normalization from the BoJ.

Despite the short-term turbulence, ING's Francesco Pesole believes the central bank's stance will remain unchanged. The bank continues to project a June rate hike to 1.0%, signaling confidence in the ongoing normalization process. As traders eye these shifts, the market remains focused on the BoJ’s next moves, particularly in relation to USD/JPY, which could see further fluctuations in the near term.

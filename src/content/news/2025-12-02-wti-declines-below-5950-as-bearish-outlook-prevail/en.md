West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has slipped below the $59.50 mark, currently trading around $59.25 during the Asian session on Tuesday. The decline is attributed to a resurgence in demand for the US Dollar (USD), which has exerted downward pressure on oil prices. Traders are closely monitoring the USD's performance as it influences various currency pairs and commodities.

The bearish sentiment in the oil market reflects broader concerns about global economic conditions and fluctuating demand. As the exchange rate of the USD strengthens, it often leads to a decrease in commodity prices, including WTI. Market participants are likely to keep an eye on upcoming economic indicators that could further impact trading dynamics in both the forex and crude oil markets.

AUD/USD surged to its 2023 peak after breaking out of a multi-month consolidation pattern, driven by a stronger-than-expected Australian core CPI report. The currency pair's exchange rate jumped as traders reacted to the surprise inflation data, which reinforced expectations of continued tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia. This bullish movement pushed the pair closer to levels last seen at the start of the year.

The Australian dollar's rally has extended against the USD, with AUD/USD currently hovering near its highest point for 2023. Analysts at Societe Generale highlighted the CPI surprise as a key catalyst, fueling momentum in the pair. Market participants are closely monitoring this breakout, as it signals potential for further upside if inflation remains resilient in Australia. This shift marks a significant milestone in AUD/USD trading, especially amid a broad focus on global inflation trends and central bank policies.

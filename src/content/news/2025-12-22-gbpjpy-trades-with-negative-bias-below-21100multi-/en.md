GBP/JPY has started the week on a bearish note, trading below the key psychological level of 211.00. After reaching a multi-year high last Friday, the currency pair has surrendered some of those gains, reflecting modest strength in the Japanese yen. This pullback comes after GBP/JPY hit its highest point since August 2008, signaling a potential shift in market dynamics.

The recent movement in the exchange rate highlights the ongoing volatility in forex markets, influenced by broader trends in the USD and EUR. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of JPY's resilience, which may indicate changing investor sentiment and could impact future trading strategies. With GBP/JPY now testing support levels, market participants will be keen to gauge whether this trend will continue or if the pair will regain its upward momentum.

EUR/USD extended its rally to around 1.1915 during the early European session on Wednesday, supported by a broad decline in the US Dollar (USD). The currency pair gained traction above the key 1.1900 level as investors remained cautious ahead of the highly anticipated US January Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which could significantly impact market sentiment.

The weaker USD provided an opportunity for the Euro (EUR) to strengthen, particularly as traders positioned themselves ahead of the NFP data release. With the EUR/USD exchange rate trading above the 1.1900 mark, market participants are closely monitoring any shifts in US labor market data that could drive further volatility in the currency pair's movement.

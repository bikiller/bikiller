During European trading hours on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signaled a potential shift in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, stating that U.S. President Donald Trump is making efforts to negotiate a resolution. This announcement prompted fluctuations in the forex market, with the EUR/USD pair seeing increased volatility, trading around 1.0850, reflecting cautious optimism among traders.

The remarks contributed to a strengthened USD, impacting other currency pairs as well. The USD/JPY exchange rate edged up to 134.80, indicating a flight to safe-haven assets amid geopolitical tensions. Market participants are now closely monitoring developments, as any progress in talks could lead to a more stable trading environment and influence future currency movements across the board.

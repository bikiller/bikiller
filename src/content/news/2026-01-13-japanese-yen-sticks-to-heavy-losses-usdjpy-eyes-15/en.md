The Japanese Yen continues to face significant losses, maintaining its downward trend during Tuesday's Asian trading session. This decline, coupled with a resurgence in U.S. Dollar demand, has pushed the USD/JPY pair to the 159.00 level, marking its highest point since July 2024. Traders are closely monitoring this upward movement as it reflects broader market sentiment and potential shifts in monetary policy.

As the USD strengthens against the JPY, market participants are also awaiting the upcoming U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The exchange rate dynamics between these two currencies highlight the ongoing volatility in forex markets, with the Yen struggling amid rising inflation concerns. Should the CPI data indicate stronger-than-expected inflation, the USD/JPY pair could see further gains, intensifying the pressure on the Japanese currency.

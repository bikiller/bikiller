The USD/MXN currency pair has bounced back from recent lows, recovering after hitting 18.20. This resurgence, however, faces potential hurdles as traders eye resistance levels at the 50-day moving average and a descending trend line located near 18.40. According to Société Générale's FX analysts, the uncertainty surrounding upside momentum could impact short-term trading strategies.

As the exchange rate fluctuates, market participants will be closely monitoring these key technical indicators. A sustained push above the resistance zone could suggest a bullish sentiment for the USD, while failure to breach these levels might reinforce the bearish outlook for the pair. Overall, the current dynamics in the USD/MXN market reflect broader trends influencing currency movements in the region.

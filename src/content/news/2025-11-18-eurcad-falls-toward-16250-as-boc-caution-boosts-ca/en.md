EUR/CAD extended its losses for a third consecutive session, trading around 1.6260 during European hours on Tuesday. The currency pair has faced downward pressure as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) appreciates, largely driven by a cautious tone from the Bank of Canada (BoC) regarding future monetary policy.

This shift in sentiment has affected the exchange rate, pushing EUR/CAD closer to the critical support level of 1.6250. Traders are closely monitoring the BoC's stance, as any further signals of caution could continue to bolster the CAD against the Euro (EUR), influencing broader market dynamics in the forex arena.

The Indian Rupee (INR) opened weaker against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, with USD/INR rising to 83.05, reflecting concerns over a slump in Indian IT stocks. The negative sentiment in the IT sector reignited fears of potential foreign outflows, pressuring the domestic currency. This shift in sentiment comes as investors worry about the broader impact of weak corporate earnings on India's economic outlook.

The Indian currency’s performance is also linked to global trends, with a stronger USD gaining traction across major pairs. Technical support for USD/INR remains at 82.60, while resistance stands at 83.30. The exchange rate has shown signs of volatility, and analysts suggest further depreciation could occur if the trend of foreign outflows continues, with market participants closely monitoring the broader global risk environment.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) fell nearly 2% during Thursday's North American session, continuing the downward trend as precious metals faced renewed liquidation. The drop comes amid a rebound in the US Dollar, which gained momentum following weaker-than-expected US economic data. The greenback's strength pressured gold and other commodities, with XAU/USD falling below key support levels, now trading near $1,910.

The US Dollar’s rise put additional strain on gold, as the exchange rate between USD and major currencies like the EUR weakened further. With economic data missing forecasts, traders saw renewed risk-off sentiment, prompting further declines in the precious metals market. The USD's resilience could prolong the liquidation phase for gold, keeping prices volatile in the short term.

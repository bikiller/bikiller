US President Donald Trump announced a reduction in tariffs on India to 18% after Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged to halt Russian oil imports. This move comes amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and is likely to affect the USD/INR exchange rate. Traders will closely monitor this development, as the tariff cut may influence future trading dynamics between the two countries, possibly boosting the Indian Rupee against the US Dollar.

The decision is expected to have a broader impact on market sentiment, with implications for global trade. The USD/INR pair could see increased volatility, particularly with oil prices potentially rising as a result of India shifting away from Russian oil. Market participants will be eyeing further policy actions from both governments as they react to the changing trade relationships.

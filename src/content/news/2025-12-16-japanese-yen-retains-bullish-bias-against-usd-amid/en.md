The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to show strength against the US Dollar (USD), marking its second consecutive day of gains. During the Asian session on Tuesday, the JPY climbed to a one-and-a-half-week high, reflecting a bullish sentiment among traders. The exchange rate for the USD/JPY pair is increasingly influenced by shifting expectations surrounding monetary policy.

Market participants are highly optimistic about a potential interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) this week, further bolstering the Yen's appeal. This divergence in central bank policies, particularly between the BoJ and the Federal Reserve, is driving the current trading dynamics. As investors adjust their positions, the JPY's upward momentum may continue, impacting broader currency market trends.

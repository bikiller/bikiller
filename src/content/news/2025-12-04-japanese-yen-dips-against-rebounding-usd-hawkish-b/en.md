The Japanese Yen (JPY) traded lower against the rebounding US Dollar (USD) during Thursday's Asian session, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. The USD/JPY currency pair saw fluctuations amid improving US economic data, which bolstered expectations for a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. Currently, the exchange rate hovers around 110.50, indicating a slight decline for the Yen as traders digest recent developments.

Despite the Yen's dip, substantial depreciation appears limited due to hawkish expectations surrounding the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Analysts suggest that any significant weakness may be curtailed as the BoJ remains vigilant against inflationary pressures. As market participants keep a close eye on upcoming economic indicators, the JPY's resilience could provide a counterbalance to USD gains, maintaining a cautious trading atmosphere.

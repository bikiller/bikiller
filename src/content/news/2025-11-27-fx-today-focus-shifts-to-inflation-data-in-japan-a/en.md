The US Dollar (USD) remained anchored within a narrow range near recent lows as trading activity slowed ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday. With volatility scarce, the USD's exchange rate against major currencies, like the Euro (EUR), showed little movement. Market participants are bracing for upcoming inflation data from Japan and Germany, which could influence trading sentiment.

Market expectations for another Federal Reserve rate cut in December continue to loom large, impacting the USD's appeal. Investors are closely monitoring the implications of inflation reports, which may sway the Fed's policy direction. As traders await these key economic indicators, the focus will shift to how they might reshape the USD's performance against the EUR and other currencies in the coming days.

The USD/CAD pair saw renewed buying interest at the start of the week, reversing much of Friday's losses and approaching a two-week low around the 1.3625 level. Spot prices traded in the 1.3665-1.3670 range during the Asian session, gaining 0.15% on the day. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar was fueled by safe-haven flows amid broader market uncertainty.

However, the Canadian Dollar found some resistance as a surge in oil prices capped further gains for USD/CAD. While the greenback was supported by safe-haven demand, the rising oil prices, a key export for Canada, helped limit the pair's upside potential. With spot prices holding steady, the outlook for the USD/CAD remains influenced by oil market dynamics and broader risk sentiment.

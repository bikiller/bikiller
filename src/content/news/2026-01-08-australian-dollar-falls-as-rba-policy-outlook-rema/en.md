The Australian Dollar (AUD) experienced a decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, as the latest Trade Balance figures showed a narrowing of the trade surplus. November's surplus stood at 2,936 million AUD, down from a revised 4,353 million AUD in October. This shift has raised concerns about the RBA's policy outlook, contributing to the AUD's downward movement in the currency pair.

Traders responded to the data, which reflects ongoing uncertainties in Australia's economic performance. As the exchange rate between AUD and USD fluctuates, market participants will be closely monitoring future economic indicators and RBA statements for further direction. The recent figures highlight the challenges facing the Australian economy and could influence future trading strategies in the forex market.

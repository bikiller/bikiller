Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a notable decline during the Asian trading session on Monday, retreating to approximately $75.00 after reaching an all-time high of $84.03 earlier in the day. This sharp reversal can be attributed to developments in the ongoing peace talks between Russia and Ukraine, which have influenced market sentiment and prompted traders to reassess their positions in precious metals.

As the exchange rate fluctuates in response to geopolitical events, investors are closely monitoring the implications for silver and other safe-haven assets. The decrease in silver prices could signal a shift in market dynamics, as traders weigh the potential stabilization in the region against previous highs. The interplay between the USD and global economic conditions continues to shape trading strategies in this volatile environment.

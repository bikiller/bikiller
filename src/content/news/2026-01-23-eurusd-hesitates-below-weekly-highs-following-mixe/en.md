EUR/USD is showing moderate losses, trading around 1.1740 on Friday after mixed PMI data for the Eurozone and the U.S. The pair has held on to most of its gains from the previous day, despite uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook. At current levels, the exchange rate remains near the week's highs, keeping it on track for its strongest weekly performance since June.

The mixed PMI reports have created a hesitant mood in the market, leaving the EUR/USD pair without clear direction. While the euro has benefitted from recent data, the U.S. dollar has been supported by expectations of a robust recovery, making the currency pair volatile in the short term. As a result, EUR/USD could see more fluctuations in the coming sessions.

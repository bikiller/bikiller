Gold (XAU/USD) is recovering slightly after a sharp bearish correction that began on Friday and continued through Monday's Asian session. The precious metal bounced back to $4,766, trimming some of the losses. However, it remains around 15% lower than last Thursday’s peak above $5,600, signaling ongoing weakness in the market.

The price action indicates that XAU/USD is still under pressure despite the recovery. With the currency pair struggling to regain ground, traders are watching for further direction in the broader market. The significant drop from recent highs reflects broader risk sentiment, with the USD remaining a dominant force in global trading, putting downward pressure on gold prices.

The GBP/USD currency pair is experiencing mild gains, trading around 1.3510 in the early European session on Tuesday. The Pound Sterling is appreciating against the US Dollar as the Bank of England (BoE) indicates a continued gradual easing of monetary policy. This shift in sentiment is bolstering investor confidence in the GBP.

As the pair approaches the first upside barrier near the 1.3550 level, traders are closely monitoring this key technical resistance. A successful break above this threshold could signal further bullish momentum for the Pound, influencing the exchange rate dynamics between GBP and USD. The market's reaction reflects broader expectations surrounding UK economic stability and interest rate policies.

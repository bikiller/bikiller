The USD/CNH exchange rate is expected to consolidate within the range of 7.0680 to 7.0880, as indicated by analysts from UOB Group. This stability comes amid ongoing fluctuations in the forex market, where traders are closely monitoring the US Dollar's performance against the Chinese Yuan. 

Looking ahead, the analysts highlight that the downward momentum for the USD remains substantial. A break below the key level of 7.0600 could pave the way for further declines, with 7.0400 emerging as the next significant support level. Market participants should remain vigilant as these developments could have implications for trading strategies in the USD/CNH currency pair.

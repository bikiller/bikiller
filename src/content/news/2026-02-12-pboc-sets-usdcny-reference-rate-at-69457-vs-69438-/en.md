The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the USD/CNY reference rate for Thursday's trading session at 6.9457, slightly higher than the previous day's fix of 6.9438. The rate was also above the market estimate of 6.9153, as projected by Reuters. The move reflects subtle fluctuations in the currency pair, which continues to respond to ongoing economic signals from both China and the broader global market.

This slight adjustment in the USD/CNY rate suggests moderate volatility in the exchange rate, with the PBOC's decision playing a key role in guiding trading behavior. As China’s central bank navigates its monetary policy, market participants will remain attentive to future reference rate fixes and any additional interventions that could influence the yuan’s performance against the U.S. dollar.

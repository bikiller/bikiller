Gold prices surged to around $5,230 (XAU/USD) in the early Asian session on Tuesday, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions and global trade uncertainty. The precious metal's rally follows recent U.S. tariff decisions, which have heightened fears of economic instability. As a safe-haven asset, gold has seen increased demand, pushing its value higher amid growing concerns in the global market.

The upward momentum in gold reflects a broader trend of risk aversion in currency markets. Traders are adjusting their positions as the USD faces pressure from trade-related developments. The uncertainty surrounding U.S. foreign policy and its economic impact has led to shifts in exchange rates, with investors flocking to gold as a hedge. This price action underscores the heightened volatility in forex markets and the potential for continued market fluctuations.

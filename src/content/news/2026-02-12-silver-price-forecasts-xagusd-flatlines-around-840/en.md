Silver (XAG/USD) experienced minor losses on Thursday, hovering around the $83.70 mark as the exchange rate stabilized amidst a steadied US Dollar. The recent fluctuations have kept the currency pair's bullish trend intact, with the $86.30 weekly high remaining within reach. 

Market analysts suggest that the current trading environment reflects a consolidation phase for silver, as investors weigh the impacts of USD movements on precious metals. As traders closely monitor economic indicators, the potential for renewed upward momentum in XAG/USD cannot be discounted, particularly if the dollar weakens in the coming sessions.

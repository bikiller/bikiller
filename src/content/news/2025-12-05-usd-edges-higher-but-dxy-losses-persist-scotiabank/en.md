The US Dollar (USD) is experiencing slight gains as it heads into Friday's trading session, although the DXY index continues to show overall losses for the week. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the DXY has dipped into the 99 range, suggesting a consolidation phase as traders reassess their positions.

Market sentiment remains cautious as the dollar's movement reflects broader economic indicators and geopolitical tensions. With the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other major currencies, such as the euro (EUR), being closely watched, fluctuations in the DXY could influence trading strategies in the forex market. Investors are likely to remain attentive to upcoming economic data releases that could further impact the dollar's performance in the near term.

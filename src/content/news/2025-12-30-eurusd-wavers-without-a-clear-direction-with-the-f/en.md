EUR/USD is experiencing a period of indecision, showing slight losses as it trades around 1.1765. The market remains quiet ahead of the New Year holiday, with traders weighing expectations around the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions. The exchange rate reflects a lack of clear direction as participants await further economic signals.

Amid this market lull, the focus remains squarely on the Fed, which could influence future movements in the currency pair. The current trading environment suggests that volatility may increase as investors anticipate the central bank's policy stance, potentially impacting both the USD and EUR in the coming sessions.

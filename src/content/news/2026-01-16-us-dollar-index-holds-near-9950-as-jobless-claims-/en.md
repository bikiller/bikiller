The US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the value of the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is experiencing a slight decline, trading around 99.30 during the Asian session on Friday. This movement follows a modest uptick in the previous session, as jobless claims data provided further support for the Federal Reserve's pause in interest rate increases.

The recent jobless claims figures have bolstered market expectations regarding the Fed's cautious approach, impacting the exchange rate dynamics of the USD. As traders weigh this data, the DXY's current position near 99.50 suggests a potential consolidation phase, with implications for key currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD, as investors adjust their strategies in response to evolving economic indicators.

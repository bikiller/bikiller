EUR/USD experienced modest gains on Wednesday as expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut continued to weigh on the US Dollar. As traders prepare for the outcome of the Fed's upcoming monetary policy meeting, confidence is building that the central bank will lower interest rates. This sentiment has contributed to the currency pair trading at 1.1658, reflecting an increase of 0.27%.

The pressure on the Greenback comes amid ongoing discussions around the potential implications of a more accommodative monetary stance from the Fed. As the market anticipates a shift in policy, the exchange rate is likely to remain sensitive to further economic indicators and central bank signals. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, which could significantly influence trading strategies in the EUR/USD pair moving forward.

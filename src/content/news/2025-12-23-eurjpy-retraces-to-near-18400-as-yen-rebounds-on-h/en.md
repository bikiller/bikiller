The EUR/JPY currency pair retraced to around 184.00 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, following a peak of 184.92 reached the previous day. This decline can be attributed to a rebound in the Japanese Yen, fueled by increasing speculation regarding potential government intervention to stabilize the currency.

Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as the Yen's recovery challenges the recent strength of the Euro. Market sentiment remains cautious, with the potential for further volatility if Japan's authorities decide to take action. As the USD remains a key factor in global market dynamics, fluctuations in the EUR/JPY pair may influence broader trading strategies in the forex market.

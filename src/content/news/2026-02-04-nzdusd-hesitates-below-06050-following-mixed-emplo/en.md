The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is struggling to gain momentum against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, trading at 0.6040 after failing to break through 0.6063 on Tuesday. Despite a brief recovery from weekly lows near 0.5990, the currency pair remains under pressure, as mixed employment data from New Zealand raises doubts about the strength of its economic recovery.

The latest employment figures have failed to provide clear direction for the NZD/USD exchange rate, leading to hesitation below the 0.6050 level. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, with the mixed data creating uncertainty about future moves in the currency pair. As a result, traders remain cautious, with potential support around 0.5990 and resistance near 0.6063.

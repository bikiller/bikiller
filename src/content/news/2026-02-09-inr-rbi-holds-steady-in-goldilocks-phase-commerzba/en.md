The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained its repo rate at 5.25%, adopting a neutral stance as it assessed the country's economic outlook. Commerzbank's Charlie Lay highlighted that the RBI's decision reflects a balanced view of India's growth and inflation prospects. This cautious approach is likely to support the stability of the Indian Rupee (INR), with traders closely watching for any shifts in policy that could impact the INR’s performance against major currencies like USD and EUR.

The INR's exchange rate remains steady as the central bank strikes a "Goldilocks" balance, avoiding any drastic moves. With India’s economic outlook positive, the RBI's position could help keep inflation expectations in check, fostering a favorable environment for trading. Market participants are likely to watch the USD/INR pair closely for any volatility triggered by global factors or potential future rate adjustments.

USD/JPY slipped below the 155.00 level after three consecutive days of gains, trading around 154.90 during the European session on Monday. The currency pair's retreat suggests a pause in the recent bullish momentum, with the exchange rate facing resistance near the upper boundary of a descending channel pattern on the daily chart.

Technical indicators hint at a possible bullish reversal for USD/JPY if the pair manages to hold above this critical level. The price action remains key in determining whether the currency pair will break out or reverse, with traders closely monitoring further moves in the coming sessions. A sustained push past the 155.00 level could signal the start of a broader uptrend.

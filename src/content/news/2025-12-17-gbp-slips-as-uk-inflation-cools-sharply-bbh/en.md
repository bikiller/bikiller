The Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing downward pressure following the sharper-than-expected decline in UK inflation for November. This development has led traders to anticipate a 25 basis points rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE) in the upcoming meeting. As a result, market speculation is shifting towards a more aggressive easing cycle over the next year, impacting the GBP/USD exchange rate.

In response to the inflation data, the GBP has weakened against major currencies, with analysts noting increased volatility in the GBP/EUR pair as well. The cooling inflation signals a potential shift in monetary policy, prompting investors to reassess their positions in the forex market. This trend highlights ongoing concerns about the UK's economic outlook, which could further influence trading strategies for GBP-related pairs in the near term.

Singapore’s FY26 budget, unveiled by the government, adopts a pro-growth stance, focusing on expanding national AI capabilities. The increased spending aims to bolster enterprise funding and attract high-quality capital, which could support the Singapore Dollar (SGD). This move could influence trading in the USD/SGD and EUR/SGD pairs as market participants assess the potential economic impact. 

As the budget emphasizes AI development, the strategic pivot aligns with Singapore’s ambition to remain competitive in the global economy. This forward-thinking fiscal policy could lead to a positive outlook for the SGD, strengthening its position against the USD. Traders will be closely monitoring any shifts in the exchange rate and how the market reacts to the increased development spending, which is expected to stimulate further growth in the tech and enterprise sectors.

The GBP/USD pair is holding firm above the 1.3500 mark, trading around 1.3520 during the early European session on Monday. This comes after the pair faced a dip to four-week lows last week, driven by concerns surrounding US tariff policies. Despite the bearish pressure, stronger-than-expected UK economic data has provided support for the British pound, enabling the currency pair to recover.

The recent uptick in GBP/USD highlights the ongoing market uncertainty, particularly with regard to potential changes in US trade policy. While the pound finds resilience above the 1.3500 level, traders are keenly watching developments in US tariff negotiations, which could sway sentiment in either direction. A sustained break above 1.3550 could indicate further bullish momentum, while renewed tariff concerns may see the pair retest lower levels.

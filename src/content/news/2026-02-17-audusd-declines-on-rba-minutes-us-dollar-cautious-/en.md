AUD/USD is trading around 0.7050 on Tuesday, reflecting a 0.40% decline as the Australian Dollar (AUD) weakens. The drop follows the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes, which showed a more cautious outlook on future interest rate hikes. Traders are reacting to the signals that the central bank may pause its tightening cycle, weighing on the Aussie.

Meanwhile, the US Dollar (USD) remains cautious ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes. Market participants are closely watching for any clues regarding the central bank's stance on monetary policy. This cautious mood has kept the USD relatively stable, as traders await further direction. With the AUD/USD pair under pressure, traders are eyeing the 0.7000 support level as a potential turning point for the currency pair in the near term.

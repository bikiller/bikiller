The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD), trading just below its estimated fair value of 1.3798. This stability comes after the currency pair closed near the same level on Friday, reflecting a cautious market sentiment as traders assess economic indicators and geopolitical factors that could influence the exchange rate.

Market analysts suggest that the CAD's resilience against the USD may be attributed to stronger-than-expected commodity prices and a stable domestic economic outlook. As the currency pair continues to hover around this key technical level, investors are closely monitoring any shifts in the US dollar's strength, particularly in relation to upcoming economic data releases that could impact trading strategies.

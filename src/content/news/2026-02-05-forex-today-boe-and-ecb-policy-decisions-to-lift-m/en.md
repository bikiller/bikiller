The forex market is set for increased volatility as key central bank decisions loom. The Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) will announce their respective monetary policies today, potentially driving sharp moves in GBP/USD and EUR/USD. The BoE’s outlook on interest rates is expected to influence the British pound, while the ECB’s stance could significantly impact the euro's exchange rate.

As of early trading, EUR/USD is holding just above the 1.0900 mark, facing resistance around 1.0930. GBP/USD remains volatile, hovering near 1.2000, with a break above 1.2050 potentially signaling bullish momentum. These levels are critical as traders anticipate possible shifts in central bank rhetoric, which could shape the direction of these currency pairs in the near term.

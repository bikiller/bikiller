Gold (XAU/USD) maintained its bullish momentum near this month’s peak as European trading began on Monday, holding above the $5,100 level following last week’s breakout. The precious metal continued to benefit from a risk-off environment, with investors seeking safe-haven assets amid persistent market uncertainty. Weakness in the USD added to gold’s appeal, supporting its exchange rate against major currencies including the EUR and GBP.  

Market participants noted that the sustained buying interest around $5,100 reflects both technical strength and fundamental drivers. Traders cited concerns over global economic growth and lingering geopolitical tensions as factors fueling demand for gold, while the currency pair’s reaction to softer U.S. economic data kept the USD under pressure. Analysts suggest that short-term trading could remain focused on support near $5,080 and resistance around $5,120.  

Looking ahead, gold’s trajectory will likely hinge on shifts in USD sentiment and broader currency market movements. A continued dollar softening could reinforce the rally, attracting further inflows from forex traders hedging against volatility. Conversely, any rebound in the USD could temper gains, highlighting the interplay between gold prices, currency pairs, and global market risk appetite.

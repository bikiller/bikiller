Gold prices (XAU/USD) experienced a decline during early European trading on Tuesday, losing momentum below the $4,300 level. This drop can be attributed to profit-taking activities and weak long liquidation among shorter-term futures traders. As traders adjusted their positions, the precious metal faced additional pressure amid shifting market sentiment.

The optimism surrounding Ukraine peace talks has further contributed to the downward pressure on gold, often viewed as a safe-haven asset. As geopolitical tensions ease, investor appetite for riskier assets may increase, leading to a potential decrease in demand for gold. This shift in sentiment could have broader implications for the currency markets, particularly impacting the exchange rates of safe-haven currencies like the USD against the EUR and other major pairs.

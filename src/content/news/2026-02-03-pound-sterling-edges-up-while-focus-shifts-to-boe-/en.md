The Pound Sterling (GBP) gained ground on Tuesday, rising against major currency peers as traders turned their attention to the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) policy meeting on Thursday. GBP/USD rose 0.2%, trading at 1.2400, while GBP/EUR edged up 0.1%, holding steady at 1.1400. The market anticipates possible insights into future rate decisions amid ongoing inflation concerns in the UK.

With the BoE decision looming, investors are closely watching for signals regarding further tightening. Any hints of a more hawkish stance could push the GBP higher, while dovish rhetoric may cause a pullback. The upcoming policy announcement is expected to shape near-term market sentiment, with analysts predicting a cautious tone given the mixed economic data.

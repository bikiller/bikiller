The Indian Rupee (INR) continued its ascent against the US Dollar (USD) for the fourth consecutive trading day on Wednesday, with the USD/INR exchange rate dropping to approximately 88.60. The Indian currency's strength is fueled by rising optimism surrounding a potential trade deal between the United States and India, which has bolstered market sentiment.

As expectations grow for an imminent announcement, traders are increasingly positioning themselves for further INR gains, reflecting a broader confidence in India's economic prospects. The ongoing developments in US-India trade relations are likely to have significant implications for the currency pair, potentially enhancing India's export competitiveness in the global market and influencing future forex trading strategies.

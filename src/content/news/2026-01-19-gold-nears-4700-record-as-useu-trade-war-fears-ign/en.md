Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a significant rally on Monday, climbing over 1.50% after hitting a four-day low on Friday. The precious metal is now trading close to the $4,700 mark, having reached a record high due to escalating geopolitical tensions surrounding the trade conflict between the United States and the European Union over the weekend. 

As fears of a trade war intensify, investors are flocking to gold as a safe-haven asset, driving its exchange rate higher. The ongoing uncertainty is likely to influence currency pair movements, particularly affecting the USD and EUR as traders seek stability amidst the turmoil. The implications for the forex market could be profound as traders adjust their positions in response to these developments.

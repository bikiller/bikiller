The USD/JPY exchange rate surged to 155.95 on Tuesday, gaining 0.80% as the US Dollar strengthened. This uptick was driven by positive US macroeconomic data, which boosted market confidence in the US economy. As a result, traders favored the USD, placing upward pressure on the currency pair. 

Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen continues to face persistent weakness due to concerns surrounding Japan’s monetary policy. The Bank of Japan's dovish stance has contributed to the JPY’s lack of momentum, allowing the USD/JPY to maintain its upward trajectory. The ongoing divergence in central bank policies between the US and Japan remains a key factor influencing the exchange rate.

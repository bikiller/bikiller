The Euro (EUR) is experiencing a slight decline, weakening by 0.2% against the US Dollar (USD) as broader USD strength prevails. As we approach the North American trading session on Wednesday, Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, note that while the Euro faces downward pressure, it is still outperforming most other G10 currencies.

Traders are closely monitoring technical levels for potential support and resistance, as the exchange rate dynamics continue to evolve amid a robust dollar backdrop.

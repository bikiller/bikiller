The Australian Dollar (AUD) remains under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) following disappointing S&P Global PMI data. As of Friday's Asian session, the AUD/USD pair is trading at 0.7040, having retraced its recent gains. The softer economic indicators suggest a slowdown in Australia's economic activity, contributing to the current weakness in the currency.

The AUD’s struggle to maintain upward momentum comes despite a brief rally earlier in the week. The release of weaker-than-expected PMI figures has raised concerns about the outlook for Australian growth. This data, coupled with a firm USD, has left the AUD vulnerable, with the currency pair now testing key support levels around 0.7040. Traders will closely monitor upcoming data for further direction.

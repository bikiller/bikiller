Euro area inflation is projected to average just below the ECB’s 2.0% target in the first half of 2026, according to Nomura economist Andrzej Szczepaniak, with energy base effects playing a central role. The forecast largely aligns with market consensus, limiting the immediate surprise factor for the EUR and keeping volatility in the EUR/USD currency pair relatively contained.

Energy-driven base effects are expected to temporarily dampen headline HICP readings, masking underlying price pressures. While the near-term profile appears benign, Nomura warns that inflation risks are skewed to the upside beyond 2026. For forex trading desks, this signals that the current stability in the EUR exchange rate against the USD may not fully reflect medium-term inflation dynamics.

If upside risks materialize, expectations around the ECB’s policy path could shift, influencing bond yields and the broader exchange rate outlook. A repricing of rate expectations would likely feed into renewed momentum in the EUR/USD currency pair, especially if US inflation trends diverge. For now, however, inflation averaging just under 2.0% in H1 2026 supports a relatively balanced trading environment for the euro.

NZD/USD continues to exhibit weakness for a third consecutive session, hovering around the 0.5830 mark during the Asian trading hours on Monday. The currency pair is experiencing downward pressure as the US Dollar (USD) stages a recovery from its earlier losses, influenced by technical factors in the market.

The recent movement in the exchange rate reflects a broader trend of USD strength, which is impacting various currency pairs. As traders adjust their positions, the sustained sub-0.5850 level suggests that the New Zealand Dollar is facing challenges amidst a recovering USD, raising questions about potential further declines in the near term.

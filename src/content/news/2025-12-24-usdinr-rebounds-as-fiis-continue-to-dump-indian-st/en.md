The Indian Rupee (INR) is experiencing renewed selling pressure against the US Dollar (USD) as it rebounds to approximately 90.20 in the USD/INR pair. This movement comes amidst ongoing selling by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in Indian stocks, contributing to a broader corrective phase in the currency pair. 

The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) intervention last week seems to have provided some temporary support, but the underlying market sentiment remains cautious. Traders are closely watching the exchange rate dynamics, as further fluctuations could impact investor confidence and trading strategies in the Indian market.

The USD/CAD currency pair remains stagnant, trading around the mid-1.4000s after failing to maintain momentum from a recent ascent to a one-and-a-half-week high. During the Asian trading session on Tuesday, the exchange rate has shown limited movement, oscillating within a narrow range that suggests a consolidation phase.

Market analysts note that the downside potential for USD/CAD appears constrained at this level, indicating that any significant declines may be unlikely in the near term. Traders are closely watching for potential catalysts that could drive the pair out of its current range as they navigate the intricacies of the forex market.

The AUD/USD currency pair has seen a strong uptrend following a breakout from a substantial base last month. This movement led to an acceleration in the exchange rate, pushing the pair higher. Traders reacted positively to the breakout, signaling continued bullish momentum. 

However, Societe Generale suggests that this uptrend could face a potential pause. As the pair rises, the market may encounter resistance levels that could slow the upward momentum. With market conditions constantly shifting, traders should remain vigilant as technical levels play a critical role in determining the next phase for AUD/USD.

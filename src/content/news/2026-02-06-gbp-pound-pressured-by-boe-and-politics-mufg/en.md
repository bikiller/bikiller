The British Pound has come under significant pressure, with the EUR/GBP exchange rate breaking above its 200-day moving average. This movement follows a shift in market expectations, as traders now anticipate a more dovish stance from the Bank of England. The Pound's sharp sell-off reflects concerns about the central bank's future policy trajectory, adding to existing political uncertainties.

As a result, GBP/USD trading has also been negatively impacted, with the Pound weakening against the US Dollar. The shift in sentiment has prompted markets to reevaluate their positions, driving the currency pair lower. With both political instability and a potential dovish BoE outlook weighing on the Pound, traders will closely monitor upcoming developments for further signs of pressure on GBP exchange rates.

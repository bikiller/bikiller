Japan’s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama has indicated that the government is prepared to employ various measures to address the ongoing decline of the Japanese Yen (JPY). In a statement reported by Bloomberg, Katayama emphasized that all options, including direct currency intervention, remain on the table as the JPY weakens against major currencies, notably the US Dollar (USD).

The Yen has recently faced significant pressure, with the USD/JPY exchange rate rising sharply, reflecting broader market trends. Analysts are closely watching these developments, as a sustained depreciation of the JPY could impact Japan's export competitiveness and inflation dynamics. As trading continues, the effectiveness of any potential government intervention will be crucial in stabilizing the currency and managing market sentiment.

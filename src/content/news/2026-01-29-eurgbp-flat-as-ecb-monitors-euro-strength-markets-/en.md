The EUR/GBP currency pair remains stable on Thursday, holding steady after facing pressure in the previous session. The Euro (EUR) has managed to maintain its position against the British Pound (GBP) despite growing speculation that the European Central Bank (ECB) could reduce interest rates later this year. This speculation has kept traders cautious, with the EUR/GBP exchange rate hovering around key levels.

Markets are now shifting focus to upcoming economic data, particularly the GDP figures due for release. Traders are looking to gauge whether the economic performance of the Eurozone and the UK could influence future ECB policy decisions. While the Euro has shown resilience, volatility is expected to persist as both central bank policies and economic indicators continue to shape the EUR/GBP exchange rate dynamics.

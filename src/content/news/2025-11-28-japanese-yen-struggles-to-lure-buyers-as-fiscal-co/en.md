The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling to attract buyers as concerns over fiscal policy overshadow a modest recovery against the US Dollar (USD). After dipping during the Asian trading session, the JPY managed to reverse its losses, but bulls are hesitant to commit further. The USD/JPY exchange rate remains under pressure, highlighting the mixed fundamental factors affecting market sentiment.

The US Dollar (USD) is anticipated to inch higher against the Japanese Yen (JPY), with analysts at UOB Group projecting a target of 157.15 for the USD/JPY currency pair. While momentum seems to favor this upward movement, they caution that further advances beyond this level may be limited, as the exchange rate is unlikely to breach 157.50 in the near term.

In the broader market outlook, UOB's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, suggest that the USD is expected to trade within a range of 155.60 to 157.50 in the coming weeks. This range reflects a cautious sentiment among traders as they navigate economic indicators and geopolitical factors influencing the forex landscape.

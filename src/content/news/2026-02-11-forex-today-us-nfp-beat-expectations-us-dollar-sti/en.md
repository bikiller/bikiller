The US Nonfarm Payrolls report for January exceeded expectations, with 130K new jobs added, signaling a positive start to the year. The Unemployment Rate dropped to 4.3%, while Average Hourly Earnings held steady at 3.7% year-over-year. Despite this upbeat data, the US Dollar struggled to gain momentum, as the EUR/USD traded around 1.0650, reflecting market skepticism about the sustainability of US economic growth.

The market reaction was muted, with traders cautious ahead of upcoming economic data and Federal Reserve meetings. The USD’s weakness persisted, even as the NFP data painted a strong employment picture. The EUR/USD pair’s inability to break key technical levels suggests ongoing uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's next move, leaving traders to assess inflationary pressures and potential rate hikes in the coming months.

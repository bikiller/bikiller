Canada's GDP exceeded expectations in Q3, recording a notable 2.6% growth. This impressive performance has bolstered the Canadian dollar (CAD) and prompted a reevaluation of the Bank of Canada's easing strategies. Analysts at TDS suggest that the USD/CAD exchange rate may find resistance near 1.41, as traders adjust their forecasts in light of this economic data.

In response to the stronger-than-anticipated economic figures, market participants are eyeing a potential decline in the USD/CAD pair, with projections indicating a target of 1.38 by year-end. This shift not only reflects confidence in the Canadian economy but also suggests a cautious approach to trading the currency pair as investors navigate the implications of future monetary policy adjustments.

The USD/JPY currency pair extended its recovery to around 153.35 during the early Asian session on Thursday, reversing some of its recent losses. The US Dollar strengthened against the Japanese Yen after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated the administration’s commitment to a strong USD policy. This reaffirmation provided fresh support for the greenback, helping push the pair above the key 153.00 mark.

The strengthening of the USD is also linked to the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain current interest rates, signaling a steady monetary stance. As market participants digest these factors, the USD/JPY exchange rate continues to hold above critical support levels, suggesting potential for further bullish momentum. Traders will be closely monitoring upcoming US economic data for further direction, with a focus on any signs of inflationary pressure that could influence future Fed actions.

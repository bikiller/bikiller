Gold (XAU/USD) has come under fresh selling pressure at the start of the week, falling below the $5,000 mark amid a stronger USD. This reversal follows Friday's sharp rally, where the precious metal surged over $150 from sub-$4,900 levels. The shift in sentiment appears driven by a combination of a rising dollar and a positive risk tone across global markets.

Despite the pullback, the downside for gold seems limited at this stage. The strong USD, supported by positive economic data, is weighing on the yellow metal, while the broader risk appetite is helping to cap losses. Traders remain cautious, with the $4,900 level acting as a key support zone for XAU/USD in the near term.

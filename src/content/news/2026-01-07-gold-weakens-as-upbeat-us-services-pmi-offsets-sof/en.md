Gold (XAU/USD) is facing downward pressure on Wednesday, trading below the significant psychological level of $4,500. The decline is attributed to a stronger-than-expected US Services PMI, which has overshadowed softer signals from the labor market. This upbeat economic data has led to a wave of profit-taking among investors, as traders reassess their positions in light of the improving outlook for the USD.

As the exchange rate for gold slips, market participants are closely monitoring other currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, which remains sensitive to shifts in US economic indicators. The strengthening of the US dollar against other currencies could further weigh on gold prices in the near term, as traders adjust their strategies to account for the latest market developments. The interplay between economic data and currency movements will be crucial for gold's trajectory in the coming sessions.

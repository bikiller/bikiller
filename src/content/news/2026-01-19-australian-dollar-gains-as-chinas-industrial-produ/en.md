The Australian Dollar (AUD) gained strength against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, bolstered by the release of Australia’s TD-MI Inflation Gauge, which saw a notable increase to 3.5% year-over-year in December, up from 3.2% the previous month. This rise in inflation expectations has influenced trading activity, causing the AUD/USD exchange rate to show resilience amid fluctuating market conditions.

As investors digest the implications of rising inflation on monetary policy, the AUD's upward momentum reflects growing confidence in Australia's economic stability. The positive data comes at a time when the market closely monitors China's industrial production figures, which also support the Australian economy due to its reliance on commodity exports. The AUD is currently trading near key resistance levels, suggesting potential for further gains if economic conditions remain favorable.

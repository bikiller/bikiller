USD/JPY fell to around 152.70 during Thursday's North American session, marking a 0.33% decline. The move came after a broad market sell-off, which saw US equities and precious metals under pressure. The USD saw a modest appreciation, but the shift in risk sentiment prompted traders to favor the Japanese Yen, pushing the currency pair lower.

At the time of writing, USD/JPY remained volatile, oscillating between 152.70 and 153.00. The decline reflects the market's cautious mood, as investors adjusted positions amid rising uncertainty. The current technical level of 152.70 remains critical for traders watching the pair for further signs of a sustained downtrend or a potential reversal.

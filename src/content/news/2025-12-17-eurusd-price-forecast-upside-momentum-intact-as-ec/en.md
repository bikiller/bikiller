The Euro (EUR) is staging a rebound against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, maintaining positive momentum as traders await the European Central Bank's (ECB) upcoming decision. Currently, the EUR/USD currency pair is trading near 1.1750, a notable recovery from a daily low of approximately 1.1703. This recovery comes as the earlier strength of the Greenback begins to wane.

Market analysts suggest that the renewed demand for the Euro may be driven by expectations surrounding the ECB's policy stance, which could influence future exchange rates. As the trading session unfolds, the focus remains on how the ECB's decisions might impact the Euro's trajectory against the USD, with traders keenly monitoring price levels for potential trading opportunities.

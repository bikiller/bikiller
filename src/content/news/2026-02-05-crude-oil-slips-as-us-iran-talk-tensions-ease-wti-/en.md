Crude oil prices saw a dip on Thursday, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) slipping by $0.95 per barrel, or 1.5%, amid easing tensions between the U.S. and Iran. The price decline followed news of reduced geopolitical concerns, providing some relief to traders. WTI tested a key technical level of $63, marking a slight pullback after recent gains.

The market reaction to the easing of U.S.-Iran tensions weighed on investor sentiment, pushing crude oil lower. As a result, the USD strengthened slightly, while traders adjusted their positions on oil-related assets. The easing geopolitical risk may prompt traders to shift focus to other factors, such as global demand and OPEC+ decisions, potentially influencing the USD and EUR in related forex pairs.

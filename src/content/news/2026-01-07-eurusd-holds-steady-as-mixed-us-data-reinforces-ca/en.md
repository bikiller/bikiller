The Euro (EUR) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) as traders digest a mixed array of US economic data. Currently, the EUR/USD currency pair is trading at approximately 1.1691, demonstrating a consolidation phase after a decline of about 0.30% on Tuesday. This stability reflects a cautious sentiment among market participants regarding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook.

The subdued response to the US data suggests that investors are weighing the implications of potentially tempered interest rate hikes from the Fed. As the exchange rate remains around this level, traders are likely to stay alert for further indicators that could influence the USD's strength and the overall trajectory of the EUR/USD pair in the coming sessions.

The US Dollar remained resilient following a robust nonfarm payrolls report, but the currency's upside was limited as traders questioned the potential for further hawkish moves from the Federal Reserve. Despite the solid jobs data, USD's rally was tempered by market skepticism over how much more tightening could be expected. This uncertainty left the greenback's momentum stalling.

EUR/USD fluctuated around 1.0650 as investors awaited the upcoming CPI report, which could provide more clarity on the Fed's rate path. Any surprise in inflation data may trigger a reassessment of rate expectations, influencing the dollar's direction. As the market waits for further cues, the short-term outlook for USD remains hinged on inflation data, with technical resistance for EUR/USD near 1.0700.

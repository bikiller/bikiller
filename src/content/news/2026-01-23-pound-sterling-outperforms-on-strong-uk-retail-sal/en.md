The Pound Sterling (GBP) surged against major currencies, hitting a near one-month high of 1.3536 against the US Dollar (USD). Stronger-than-expected UK S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for January fueled investor optimism, signaling resilience in the economy. This positive surprise comes amid an ongoing recovery in the UK’s Retail Sales, which returned to growth in December, surpassing expectations.

As the GBP/USD pair climbs, traders are reassessing their outlook for the Bank of England’s future rate hikes. The upbeat economic data has boosted sentiment, suggesting the UK economy may be on a firmer footing than previously anticipated. With Retail Sales gaining momentum and PMI figures pointing to expanding business activity, the pound is likely to retain upward momentum, possibly targeting 1.36 in the near term, barring any major shifts in US economic data or geopolitical tensions.

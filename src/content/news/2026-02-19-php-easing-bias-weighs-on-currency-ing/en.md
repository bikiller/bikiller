The Philippine Peso (PHP) weakened after the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 4.25%. While the move was widely anticipated, the central bank’s cautious tone on economic growth and uncertain future guidance added downward pressure on the currency. The BSP's stance signals concerns about slower-than-expected growth, which could influence future monetary policy.

This rate cut has contributed to the PHP's weaker outlook against major currencies, particularly the US Dollar (USD). The EUR/USD pair continues to see fluctuations as market participants digest the implications of the BSP's decision. With softer economic growth, traders are positioning for more volatility, as the exchange rate for the PHP remains under pressure in the short term.

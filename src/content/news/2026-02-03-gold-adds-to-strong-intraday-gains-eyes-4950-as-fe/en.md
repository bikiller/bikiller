Gold (XAU/USD) extended its strong intraday gains during the first half of Tuesday's European session, approaching the $4,950 level. The rally followed two days of heavy liquidation, with short-covering contributing to the rebound. As markets digest shifting expectations around the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy, gold's recent recovery signals traders' growing confidence in the precious metal.

The movement in XAU/USD comes amid rising bets for a potential rate cut by the Fed, which has weighed on the US dollar (USD). As the USD weakens, gold becomes more attractive, pushing the currency pair higher. At the time of writing, traders are eyeing key resistance near the $4,950 mark, with continued volatility likely depending on the Fed's stance on interest rates in the coming months.

The USD/JPY currency pair has continued its downward trajectory, trading 0.23% lower to approximately 155.80 during the European trading session on Wednesday. This decline marks the third consecutive day of losses for the pair, which has struggled to maintain momentum following a peak of nearly 158.00, the highest exchange rate in almost 11 months.

The recent pullback comes as market participants react to the implications of the Bank of Japan's policies, which had previously driven the USD/JPY higher. As the pair retraces these gains, traders are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators that could further influence the exchange rate and shape market sentiment in the days ahead.

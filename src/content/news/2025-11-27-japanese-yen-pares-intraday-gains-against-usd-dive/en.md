The Japanese Yen (JPY) has retraced some of its earlier intraday gains against the US Dollar (USD), with the exchange rate hovering around key technical levels. Despite the Yen's brief recovery, sustained downside pressure remains limited. Current market sentiment is buoyed by expectations of lower interest rates in the US, which are bolstering the USD's appeal against the JPY.

Additionally, optimism surrounding a potential peace agreement in the Russia-Ukraine conflict is enhancing global risk appetite, further supporting the USD. As traders monitor the divergent outlooks of the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve, the USD/JPY currency pair is likely to remain within a constrained range, reflecting the complex interplay of geopolitical and economic factors influencing forex markets.

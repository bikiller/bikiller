The USD/JPY currency pair continues to face downward pressure as the Japanese Yen strengthens against the US Dollar. On Wednesday, the Yen extended its three-day winning streak, with the exchange rate slipping below key daily simple moving averages (SMAs). Broad-based demand for the Yen has kept the USD/JPY under selling pressure, signaling a bearish sentiment in the market.

As the pair moves lower, traders are closely monitoring technical levels for further clues. The price's break beneath the key SMAs suggests a potential shift in momentum, with the Yen continuing to capitalize on risk-off sentiment in global markets. This move further supports the likelihood of sustained bearish pressure on USD/JPY in the near term.

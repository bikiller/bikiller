Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing modest losses as it trades through the Asian session on Friday, reflecting a lack of bearish conviction. The precious metal remains within its weekly range, weighed down by mixed signals from the market. Current trading conditions indicate that gold is struggling to break free from recent price levels, despite ongoing fluctuations.

The recent US jobs data has tempered expectations surrounding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, contributing to gold's subdued performance. As the USD strengthens in response to the labor market figures, the exchange rate dynamics continue to influence gold’s appeal among investors. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as they may signal shifting trends in both gold and broader forex markets.

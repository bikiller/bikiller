AUD/USD is trading at 0.7050 on Friday, down 0.13% for the day, as US GDP data came in significantly weaker than expected. Despite the disappointing growth figures, inflation remains persistent, adding a layer of uncertainty to market sentiment. The weaker-than-forecasted GDP print dampened expectations for a strong economic recovery, but ongoing inflation concerns are preventing any drastic moves in the US dollar.

This mixed economic outlook has kept the AUD/USD exchange rate under pressure, with traders reacting to the contrasting signals from the US economy. The 0.7050 level could act as a key support, while a shift in US inflation trends could lead to further volatility. As the US Federal Reserve navigates between growth concerns and inflation, the currency pair may face heightened fluctuations in the short term.

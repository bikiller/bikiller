The Indian Rupee (INR) continued its downward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR currency pair reaching a record high of 90.86. This movement reflects ongoing uncertainty surrounding US-India trade relations, which has been a significant factor in the recent volatility of the exchange rate.

As traders await India's upcoming inflation data, the pressure on the INR is expected to persist. Market analysts are closely monitoring this key economic indicator, as it could influence future monetary policy decisions and impact the INR's performance against major currencies like the USD and EUR.

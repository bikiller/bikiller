GBP/USD slipped below the 1.3400 mark on Wednesday as the UK's latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report revealed a significant decline in inflation. This unexpected dip has all but ensured that the Bank of England (BoE) will consider easing its monetary policy in the near future. The currency pair's downward movement signals a growing concern among traders regarding the strength of the British Pound in light of softer economic data.

Simultaneously, the US Dollar showed signs of recovery, adding pressure on Sterling. As the USD gains traction against a backdrop of improving economic sentiment, the exchange rate dynamics between GBP and USD will be closely monitored by investors. With the BoE's policy decision looming, the focus will remain on how these developments impact the broader forex market and trading strategies in the coming days.

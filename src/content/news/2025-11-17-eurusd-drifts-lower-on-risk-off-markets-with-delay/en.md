The EUR/USD currency pair opened the week on a bearish note, drifting lower amid risk-off sentiment in the markets. Currently trading around the 1.1600 area, the exchange rate has seen a continuation of Friday's downward reversal from session highs above 1.1650. Traders are closely monitoring developments as delayed US economic data comes into focus.

The pullback in the EUR/USD reflects broader market anxieties, with investors reacting to uncertainties surrounding economic indicators that could influence the USD. As the currency pair navigates this volatile phase, any signs of economic strength from the US could further impact the exchange rate, prompting traders to recalibrate their positions in anticipation of upcoming data releases.

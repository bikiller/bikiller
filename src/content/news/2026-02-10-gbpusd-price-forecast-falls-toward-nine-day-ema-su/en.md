GBP/USD is experiencing a subdued trading session, holding around 1.3680 during European hours on Tuesday following two consecutive days of losses. The pair’s performance reflects a consistent downtrend, yet the broader outlook remains bullish. Technical indicators suggest support at the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA) near 1.3650, which could prevent further declines in the near term.

The pair remains within an ascending channel on the daily chart, maintaining an overall positive trend despite short-term setbacks. A bounce from the 1.3650 support could signal a renewed attempt to test higher levels, possibly above the 1.3700 mark. As long as GBP/USD stays above this critical support, the medium-term bullish bias remains intact, with traders likely watching for further price action in the coming sessions.

Gold (XAU/USD) continues to trade defensively, fluctuating below the $4,600 level while remaining close to its recent all-time high. As the market anticipates the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, traders are cautious, monitoring potential impacts on the USD and overall market sentiment. 

The precious metal's performance reflects a broader fundamental backdrop, with ongoing concerns about inflation driving interest in safe-haven assets. Despite its current position, gold's resilience suggests that any shifts in the exchange rate could lead to renewed buying pressure, especially if the CPI data indicates rising inflationary pressures in the US economy.

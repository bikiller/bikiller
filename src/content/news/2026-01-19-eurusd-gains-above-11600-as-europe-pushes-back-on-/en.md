The EUR/USD currency pair moved upward during the early European session on Monday, climbing to approximately 1.1625. This rise marks a significant turnaround, breaking a four-day losing streak that had seen the exchange rate pressured. The rebound is attributed to growing resistance from Europe against U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff threats, which have been a source of market instability.

Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as heightened tensions could influence future trading strategies. The strengthened euro against the dollar may signal traders' confidence in the European economy amid U.S. trade policy uncertainties. As the market reacts, fluctuations around the 1.1600 technical level will be crucial for determining the next movement in this key currency pair.

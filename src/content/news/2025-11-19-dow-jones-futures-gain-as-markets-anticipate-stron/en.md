Dow Jones futures climbed 0.04%, reaching approximately 46,200 during European trading hours on Wednesday, as investors geared up for expected strong earnings reports from Nvidia. This optimism also buoyed S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures, which rose 0.09% and 0.06%, trading near 6,650 and 24,600, respectively. 

The positive sentiment in U.S. indices reflects broader market confidence, impacting currency pairs like USD/EUR, which saw fluctuations as traders reacted to the earnings outlook. This movement may influence trading strategies, prompting shifts in exchange rates as investors position themselves ahead of the U.S. market opening.

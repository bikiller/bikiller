Currently, the currency pair is trading around $4,194, a drop from the intraday peak of $4,218. Market sentiment remains cautious, with investors closely monitoring indications of a hawkish stance from the Fed.

This consolidation phase reflects uncertainty in the market regarding future monetary policy, potentially impacting the exchange rate of gold against the USD.

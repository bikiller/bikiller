Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a dramatic sell-off on Friday, surrendering gains made just a day earlier when it reached a record high. The price decline was attributed to forced liquidations and a strong rebound in the U.S. dollar, which pressured the precious metal lower. As traders adjusted positions, silver fell sharply, reflecting the volatile dynamics in the forex market.

The recent shift in the exchange rate of USD against other currencies, particularly the EUR, has intensified trading activities in commodity markets. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as the strength of the USD often inversely affects silver prices. The sharp correction in XAG/USD raises concerns about potential further declines, with market participants watching for key technical levels to gauge where prices might stabilize.

The USD/CHF currency pair is trading in a narrow range as both US and Swiss economic factors weigh on market sentiment. At 0.7738, the exchange rate is down 0.16% on the day, with the Swiss Franc under pressure from weaker-than-expected Swiss economic data. The soft results have created headwinds for the CHF, limiting its ability to capitalize on any gains.

Meanwhile, the US Dollar remains subdued, with soft trading conditions in the broader USD market limiting the upside potential for USD/CHF. The lack of clear direction, driven by uncertainty around US trade developments, is keeping the pair stuck in its current range. Market participants are likely to continue monitoring the situation for any shifts in sentiment.

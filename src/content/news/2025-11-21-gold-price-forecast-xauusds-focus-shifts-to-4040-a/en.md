Gold (XAU/USD) has seen a pullback after three consecutive days of gains, with the current trading focus shifting towards key support levels at $4,040 and $4,000. The retreat in precious metals comes as investors scale back their expectations for a potential Federal Reserve rate cut in December, impacting the overall market sentiment.

As the exchange rate for gold declines, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence the Fed's monetary policy. The shift in outlook has prompted traders to reassess their positions, potentially leading to further volatility in the XAU/USD currency pair as it navigates these critical support areas.

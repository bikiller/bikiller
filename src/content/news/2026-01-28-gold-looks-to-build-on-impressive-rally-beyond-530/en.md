Gold (XAU/USD) continues its strong upward trajectory, hitting new all-time highs above the $5,300 mark during the first half of the European session on Wednesday. The metal is in the midst of an impressive rally, extending its gains to an eight-day winning streak. With traders eagerly awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision, bullish sentiment is driving continued buying interest in the precious metal.

The recent surge in gold prices is fueled by concerns over the USD’s weakening performance ahead of the Fed's policy announcement. As market participants position themselves ahead of potential changes to U.S. monetary policy, gold remains a preferred safe-haven asset. With the exchange rate firmly above key technical levels, the focus now shifts to whether gold can sustain its momentum through the Fed's decision, which could influence broader market sentiment and trading activity in the coming sessions.

Gold (XAU/USD) declined during the Asian session on Thursday, retreating from a nearly two-week high reached the previous day. The precious metal found resistance above $1,850, falling by less than 0.50% for the day and trading just above the $1,850 mark. The pullback comes amid a stronger-than-expected US nonfarm payroll (NFP) report, which has tempered expectations for a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in March.

The market's mixed sentiment reflects the shifting outlook for US monetary policy. Strong labor market data has bolstered the USD, leading to a cooling of speculative bets on a March rate cut. Despite the retreat, gold's downside remains limited as traders await further economic data and signals from the Fed. At present, the metal faces resistance near $1,860, with support still holding around $1,850, keeping price action contained within a narrow range.

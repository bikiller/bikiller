Traders are keenly observing the upward trajectory as EUR/USD remains within a defined ascending channel pattern.

Technical indicators suggest a robust bullish bias, with market participants confident in further upward movement. The exchange rate's persistence near 1.1800 highlights the euro's strength against the USD, which could lead to potential resistance levels being tested in the near term.

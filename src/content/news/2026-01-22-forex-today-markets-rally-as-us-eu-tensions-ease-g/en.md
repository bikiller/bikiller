Markets saw a surge in risk sentiment today, with investors reacting positively to easing tensions between the US and the EU. US President Donald Trump confirmed progress in NATO discussions, particularly regarding the framework for a future Greenland deal. This news helped to stabilize global markets, sending the USD higher against most major currencies. The EUR/USD exchange rate saw modest declines, trading around 1.0750, while the USD/JPY rose to 131.50.

Gold prices surged to a fresh record high, surpassing the $2,000 mark, as risk-on sentiment combined with inflation concerns boosted demand for the safe-haven asset. The easing of geopolitical uncertainty led to a shift from defensive assets to equities, with the S&P 500 posting gains. Forex traders focused on technical levels, with key support seen for USD pairs near 1.0700 in EUR/USD and resistance in USD/JPY at 132.00.

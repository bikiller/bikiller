The NZD/USD pair gained momentum during the Asian session on Wednesday, rising to a two-week high around 0.6065. This move came after a modest pullback the previous day, as the New Zealand dollar regained positive traction. The increase was largely attributed to a weakened USD, with traders awaiting the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which kept the greenback under pressure.

The exchange rate for the NZD/USD showed a notable recovery, benefiting from a depressed USD as market participants remain cautious ahead of key economic data. The US jobs report, due later this week, is expected to influence future market direction, with the USD's short-term outlook hinging on the data's implications for the Federal Reserve's policy stance. This trading environment sets the stage for further volatility in the currency pair.

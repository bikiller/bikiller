The USD is facing heightened uncertainty following recent US Supreme Court rulings, which have disrupted the nation's tariff policy. In response, President Trump announced the imposition of new global tariffs, subsequently increasing them. These developments are clouding the outlook for US economic policy and adding volatility to the USD. As traders process the implications, the currency’s exchange rate remains susceptible to sharp swings.

The EUR/USD currency pair is feeling the pressure, with the euro gaining as market sentiment shifts. Traders are closely monitoring the impact of tariff escalation on US inflation and broader trade relations. With the USD under strain, the pair could test key support levels, particularly near 1.0800. As the global economic outlook evolves, further tariff-related developments could drive additional volatility across the forex markets.

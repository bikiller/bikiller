Gold prices surged in the early Asian session on Tuesday, with XAU/USD climbing to nearly $4,600. This uptick follows a slight retreat from a record high of $4,630 reached recently, driven by ongoing uncertainty surrounding U.S. Federal Reserve policy and increasing geopolitical tensions. Safe-haven flows continue to bolster the precious metal as traders seek refuge amidst fluctuating market conditions.

The price movement reflects broader market sentiments as investors weigh the implications of Fed decisions on interest rates and the USD's strength. As geopolitical risks linger and economic indicators shift, the XAU/USD exchange rate remains sensitive to developments, potentially influencing trading strategies across various currency pairs, including EUR/USD and USD/JPY. Traders are closely monitoring these dynamics to gauge future movements in gold and the overall forex market.

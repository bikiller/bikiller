There is a growing consensus in Europe about the need for greater strategic autonomy, which could provide support for the Euro (EUR). As this sentiment strengthens, EUR/USD may face upward pressure in the near term. However, the currency pair is encountering key resistance around the 1.1770-1.1780 range, which could limit further gains. 

Market traders will closely monitor these technical levels, as a sustained move above 1.1780 could signal continued bullish momentum for the EUR. Despite the potential upside, the broader market remains cautious, and much will depend on developments in European policy and global economic conditions. The strength of the Euro is likely to remain tied to the evolving geopolitical landscape.

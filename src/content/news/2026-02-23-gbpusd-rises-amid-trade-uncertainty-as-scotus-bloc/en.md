GBP/USD saw a modest uptick of 0.31% on Monday, climbing amid ongoing trade uncertainty after the US Supreme Court blocked President Donald Trump’s tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The decision prompted market reactions, pushing the British Pound higher against the US Dollar, as traders digested the implications for US trade policies. 

The US Dollar (USD) remains under pressure, weighed down by the uncertainty surrounding future tariff decisions. The Court's ruling undermines the strength of Trump's trade measures, leaving the USD vulnerable in a market cautious about policy changes. With GBP/USD showing a clear upward trend, traders will be watching closely for any signs of further shifts in US trade dynamics.

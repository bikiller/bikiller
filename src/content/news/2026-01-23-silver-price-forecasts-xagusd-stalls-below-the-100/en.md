Silver (XAG/USD) surged to a new all-time high of $99.39 on Friday, driven by increased demand amid a weaker US Dollar. However, the currency pair struggled to maintain momentum above the key $100.00 psychological level, retreating to $98.25 by the time of writing. This pullback highlights the challenges in sustaining bullish momentum at such critical price points.

The silver market continues to face volatile movements as traders react to fluctuations in global risk sentiment and the USD’s performance. With the XAG/USD pair hovering just below significant resistance, market participants are closely watching for any signs of a breakout or further consolidation. The price action indicates ongoing uncertainty, with a potential shift depending on upcoming economic data and broader market trends.

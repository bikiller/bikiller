The EUR/GBP currency pair experienced a slight decline on Wednesday, trading at 0.8766, down 0.24%. This movement comes as investors react to the latest UK budget announcement by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, which provided unexpected support for the British Pound. Initially, the currency faced selling pressure, but sentiment shifted as the budget details began to resonate positively in the market.

The supportive measures outlined in the budget appear to have helped the Pound recover some of its earlier losses against the Euro. Traders are now closely monitoring the implications of these fiscal changes on the UK economy and the broader exchange rate dynamics. As the trading session unfolds, any further developments in the UK economic outlook will likely influence the EUR/GBP exchange rate, adding to the anticipation in the forex market.

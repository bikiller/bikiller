The EUR/USD exchange rate remains under pressure, with support seen at the 1.1750 level, according to ING’s Francesco Pesole. As markets continue to price in flat ECB rates for 2026, attention turns to ECB President Christine Lagarde’s upcoming speech to the ECON Committee. Despite the potential market-moving event, analysts believe that current data offers little to alter the outlook, leaving expectations unchanged.

The release of the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) is unlikely to affect market sentiment or shift expectations for the Eurozone’s monetary policy. With the EUR/USD pair hovering near key support, traders are watching for further signals, though short-term price movements are expected to remain largely driven by the broader economic context and the outlook for U.S. interest rates.

The GBP/USD currency pair has experienced a decline, falling below the crucial 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) support level of 1.3331. On Tuesday, the exchange rate weakened by 0.21%, trading below the 1.3300 mark after peaking at 1.3356. This downward movement comes as traders prepare for the upcoming Federal Reserve policy decision, which has heightened market uncertainty.

The strengthening of the US Dollar, driven by robust JOLTS data, has put additional pressure on the British Pound. As market participants brace for possible implications from the Fed meeting, the GBP/USD pair reflects the broader trend of traders adjusting their positions in response to dollar strength. The outlook remains cautious as the market awaits further direction from the central bank.

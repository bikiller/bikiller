Gold and silver prices continued their selloff as the new trading week began on Monday, February 2. Gold dropped by 1.2%, trading near $1,864 per ounce, while silver saw a steeper decline of 2%, falling to around $22.50. The precious metals faced pressure amid a strengthening USD, as the greenback gained against major currencies like the EUR and JPY. The EUR/USD exchange rate saw a slight pullback, trading at 1.0850, while USD/JPY held steady near 130.50.

The market’s focus shifted towards economic data and potential shifts in U.S. monetary policy. Stronger-than-expected economic reports last week sparked speculation of tighter policies from the Federal Reserve, fueling further strength in the USD. As the dollar rises, demand for safe-haven assets like gold and silver weakens, continuing the downward trend. Traders will be monitoring upcoming economic indicators and Fed comments closely for further direction in the markets.

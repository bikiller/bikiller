The USD/INR currency pair continues to show resilience, with the Indian Rupee (INR) extending its losses for the fourth consecutive trading day against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday. The exchange rate remained firm, even as the USD weakened globally. Market analysts attribute the INR's decline to persistent inflation concerns and a strong performance from the US labor market, which has bolstered confidence in the USD.

As the USD remains a key currency in global trade, its relative strength impacts the INR, leading to fluctuations in the exchange rate. Traders are closely monitoring the technical levels, with key support and resistance points influencing trading strategies. The ongoing depreciation of the INR may prompt interventions from the Reserve Bank of India, as policymakers seek to stabilize the currency amid volatility in the forex markets.

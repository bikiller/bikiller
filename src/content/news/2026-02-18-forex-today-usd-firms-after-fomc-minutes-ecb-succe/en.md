The US dollar strengthened following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, which reaffirmed the potential for more interest rate hikes. The minutes revealed that many Fed members continue to view inflation as a key concern, supporting a hawkish stance. As a result, USD/JPY rose to 133.80, with the dollar gaining across the board. EUR/USD traded at 1.0650, down from earlier highs, reflecting the strengthening of the USD.

In Europe, attention turned to the potential early departure of European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde. A report from the Financial Times suggested she may leave before her planned retirement in 2027. This uncertainty is adding volatility to the EUR/USD exchange rate, which has been trending lower. Traders are closely watching this development, as the timing of Lagarde’s exit could influence future ECB policy and market expectations for the euro.

The EUR/USD currency pair remains stable, trading around 1.1770 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. This steady performance comes as traders anticipate the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, which could provide further insights into the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction.

Market sentiment is largely influenced by expectations of additional rate cuts from the Fed in 2026, following a 25-basis-point reduction implemented in December. As traders weigh the implications of these potential changes, the exchange rate remains resilient above the 1.1750 level, reflecting cautious optimism in the market amidst ongoing economic considerations.

GBP/USD is currently trading at 1.3760, down 0.30% on the day as the US Dollar (USD) gains strength. The move follows a breakthrough in the US Senate, boosting investor confidence in the greenback. This development has put pressure on the British Pound, with the currency pair facing resistance at the 1.3800 level.

The market is also eyeing the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) meeting, which could influence GBP sentiment in the near term. Traders are cautious, waiting for more clarity on potential shifts in UK monetary policy. In the meantime, the USD remains the dominant force in the currency pair, with the broader market focusing on US economic data and the political landscape.

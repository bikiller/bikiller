The USD/SGD exchange rate has begun to recover from earlier losses, driven by reduced market expectations for tightening from the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in April. Following a dip after US tariff news, the pair is now rebounding as sentiment shifts, with the Singapore Dollar (SGD) facing headwinds from weaker risk appetite and the fading likelihood of an imminent MAS policy change. 

As the USD strengthens, the pair's recent retracement highlights the dynamic nature of forex trading amid global economic uncertainties. Technical levels indicate that the USD/SGD could continue to find support if broader market conditions stay subdued, with potential for further volatility if any new developments on the MAS front arise. Traders will be watching closely for any shifts in risk sentiment that could impact the currency pair in the short term.

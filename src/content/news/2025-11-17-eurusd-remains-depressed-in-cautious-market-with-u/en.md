The EUR/USD currency pair opened the week on a subdued note, currently trading around the 1.1600 level. This movement marks a continuation of Friday's reversal after reaching session highs above 1.1650. Traders are closely monitoring the market ahead of upcoming US economic data, which could influence the exchange rate and shift market sentiment.

The cautious market environment has contributed to the softness in the euro against the dollar. As the pair retraces from its recent highs, investors remain vigilant, looking for signals that may guide future trading strategies. The focus on US data highlights the ongoing influence of economic indicators on currency movements, particularly for the USD.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) has retreated below the 99.50 mark, currently trading around 99.45 during early European trading hours on Thursday. This decline reflects growing expectations for potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which is influencing market sentiment and pressuring the greenback against a basket of other currencies.

As traders adjust their positions, the USD's weakness is evident in various currency pairs. The euro (EUR) is gaining traction, while the exchange rate dynamics suggest increased volatility ahead. Investors are closely monitoring economic indicators that could signal shifts in monetary policy, as the DXY's current level raises questions about the dollar's strength in the weeks to come.

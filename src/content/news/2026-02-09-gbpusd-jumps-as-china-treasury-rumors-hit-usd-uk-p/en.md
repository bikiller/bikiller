The GBP/USD exchange rate surged as rumors spread that China was seeking to reduce its exposure to U.S. Treasuries, putting pressure on the USD. This development triggered a notable jump in the Pound Sterling, with the pair climbing to $1.2440, marking a 0.3% gain. Market participants reacted to the potential shift in Chinese investment strategy, which could impact global demand for the U.S. dollar.

However, the rally was limited by ongoing political instability in the UK, which continues to weigh on investor sentiment. Despite the positive momentum for the Pound, concerns over the political landscape capped further gains. As a result, GBP/USD failed to break past the key resistance level of $1.2500, with the market eyeing any developments in UK politics for clues on future price direction.

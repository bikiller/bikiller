The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increased the Official Cash Rate (OCR) by 25 basis points, raising it from 3.60% to 3.85%. The move, which was widely anticipated by the market, is seen as a response to ongoing inflation concerns and signals the RBA's commitment to tightening monetary policy.

As a result of the rate hike, the AUD/USD exchange rate saw an uptick, reflecting increased investor confidence in the Australian economy. With the OCR at 3.85%, the Australian Dollar remains one of the stronger currencies in the forex market, supported by the RBA's more hawkish stance. Traders are closely monitoring further RBA decisions, with the potential for additional tightening, depending on economic data and inflation trends.

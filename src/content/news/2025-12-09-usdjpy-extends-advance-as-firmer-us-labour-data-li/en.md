The USD/JPY currency pair continues its upward trajectory, extending gains for the third consecutive day as the US Dollar strengthens amid positive labor market data. As of now, USD/JPY is trading around 156.90, marking its highest level since November 25. This rally comes as investors react to firmer signals from the US labor market, bolstering confidence in the Greenback.

The Japanese Yen has weakened against the Dollar, reflecting a broader trend in the foreign exchange market. With the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision looming, traders are closely monitoring the implications of these labor data on future monetary policy. The exchange rate movements suggest a growing expectation for a strong USD as market participants assess potential actions by the Fed.

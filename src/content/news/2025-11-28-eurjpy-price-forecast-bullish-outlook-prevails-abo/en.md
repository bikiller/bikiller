The EUR/JPY currency pair is trading in negative territory, hovering around the exchange rate of 181.05 during the early European session on Friday. This movement comes as the Japanese Yen (JPY) strengthens against the Euro (EUR), influenced by recent verbal intervention from Japanese authorities aimed at stabilizing the Yen.

Market sentiment leans towards a bullish outlook for EUR/JPY while the exchange rate remains above the critical level of 181.00. Traders are closely watching this pair, as any further moves from Japanese officials could impact future trading dynamics and strengthen the JPY's position against the EUR in the ongoing session.

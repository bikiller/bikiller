The Pound Sterling (GBP) saw a significant uptick against its major counterparts on Monday, buoyed by the United Kingdom's Q3 GDP growth, which held steady at 0.1%. This unexpected stability has sparked renewed interest among traders, pushing the GBP/USD exchange rate closer to key resistance levels. As traders respond to the data, the currency pair is eyeing a potential breakout if momentum continues.

In contrast, the EUR/GBP pair has faced downward pressure as the Eurozone grapples with its own economic challenges. With the GBP gaining traction, the exchange rate dynamics are shifting, making the British currency more attractive to investors. As the market digests the GDP figures, further volatility may emerge, particularly against the backdrop of ongoing developments in both the USD and EUR markets.

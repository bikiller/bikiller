The USD/CHF currency pair continued its upward trend for the second consecutive session, climbing to approximately 0.7780 during European trading hours on Tuesday. This recovery reflects a strengthening of the US dollar as traders navigate the uncertainties surrounding a potential government shutdown and anticipate the Federal Reserve's policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday.

Despite the recent gains, analysts suggest that the upside for USD/CHF may be limited due to prevailing market caution. Investors are closely monitoring the situation in the US, which could influence the exchange rate in the short term. As uncertainty looms, the dynamics of this currency pair remain closely tied to upcoming economic indicators and geopolitical developments.

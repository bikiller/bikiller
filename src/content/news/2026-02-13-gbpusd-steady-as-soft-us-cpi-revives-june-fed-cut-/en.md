The GBP/USD currency pair remains stable around 1.3620, as traders respond to the latest US inflation data. The soft Consumer Price Index (CPI) report has sparked renewed speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its June meeting. The exchange rate has held steady as market participants adjust expectations for the Fed's policy outlook.

The weaker-than-expected CPI data has increased bets that the Fed may ease monetary policy sooner than previously anticipated. As a result, the USD is under pressure, keeping the GBP/USD exchange rate well-supported at current levels. With market focus shifting to the upcoming Fed meeting, the currency pair’s movement will hinge on further inflation releases and any guidance from US policymakers.

The US Dollar (USD) is experiencing a mixed performance in a subdued trading environment as market participants position themselves ahead of the pivotal Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision set for Wednesday. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the currency is trading in narrow ranges, reflecting uncertainty among investors regarding potential shifts in monetary policy.

As attention turns to the FOMC meeting, the EUR/USD pair is hovering around 1.0850, while the USD/JPY stands at 150.30. Traders are closely monitoring technical levels, with any surprises from the FOMC likely to trigger significant volatility across currency pairs. The outcome could have lasting implications on the USD's exchange rates, influencing broader market sentiment and positioning ahead of year-end trading.

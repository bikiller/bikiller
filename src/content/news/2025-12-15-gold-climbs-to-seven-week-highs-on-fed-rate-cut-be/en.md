Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to seven-week highs, approaching $4,350 during early European trading on Monday. This increase is fueled by growing speculation around potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in the coming year, prompting heightened safe-haven demand. As investors seek stability amidst economic uncertainty, gold has become an attractive alternative asset.

The rising price of gold reflects broader market movements influenced by the USD's performance. A potential shift in Fed policy could weigh on the USD, leading traders to favor non-yielding assets like gold. As the exchange rate dynamics shift, the implications for currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD could be significant, with gold serving as a bellwether for market sentiment.

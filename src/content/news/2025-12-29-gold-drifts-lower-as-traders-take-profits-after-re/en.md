Gold prices (XAU/USD) have retreated from a record high of nearly $4,550 during early European trading on Monday, as profit-taking among traders takes center stage ahead of the upcoming holidays. This pullback highlights the volatility in the precious metal's market, where recent gains have drawn significant interest, prompting some investors to cash in on their positions.

Additionally, a strengthening US Dollar (USD) is contributing to the downward pressure on gold. As the dollar appreciates, it increases the cost of gold for non-US buyers, which can lead to decreased demand and further impact prices. Traders will be closely monitoring exchange rates, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies, as these fluctuations may dictate future movements in the gold market.

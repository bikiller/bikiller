Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a moderate uptick as traders engage in dip-buying at the beginning of the week, following a slight retreat from the $4,260 mark, where it hovered near its highest levels since October 21. This movement is largely influenced by dovish sentiments surrounding the Federal Reserve and increasing geopolitical tensions, which are pushing investors to seek safe-haven assets.

Despite this upward trajectory, gold's advance lacks strong bullish momentum, reflecting uncertainty in the market. As traders assess the potential impacts of Federal Reserve policies on the USD and broader economic conditions, the exchange rate for gold remains sensitive to any shifts in sentiment. Continued geopolitical risks are likely to keep gold in focus, as investors weigh their options in an environment characterized by volatility and mixed economic signals.

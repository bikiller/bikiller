The US Dollar continues to face pressure, driven mainly by softer macroeconomic data and evolving Federal Reserve expectations. Despite headlines surrounding de-dollarisation and AI-induced volatility in equities, the USD remains largely influenced by key US economic releases. Recent fluctuations in the EUR/USD pair highlight this trend, with the exchange rate dipping to a support level near 1.0700 before recovering slightly.

Market participants are closely watching upcoming data for clues on the Fed's next moves. If inflation data continues to soften, traders expect further reductions in Fed rate hike expectations, potentially weighing on the USD. The dollar's performance is increasingly dependent on US economic indicators, with the EUR/USD pair continuing to fluctuate within a narrow range, while other pairs like USD/JPY and GBP/USD remain sensitive to broader risk sentiment.

EUR/GBP is trading around 0.8680 on Monday, reflecting a slight 0.10% gain. The pair has found modest support from the Euro, despite weak sentiment from Germany. Recent economic data from the Eurozone’s largest economy has failed to provide significant momentum for the currency, leaving the exchange rate relatively stable.

In contrast, the UK’s economic outlook remains stable, contributing to the pair's limited movement. With little impactful news on either side, EUR/GBP continues to hover near technical levels, maintaining its narrow range. Traders are likely to watch for any shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic updates to provide clearer direction.

The USD/CAD currency pair continues its downward trajectory, experiencing a second consecutive day of selling pressure after rejecting the 1.3800 resistance level. Currently, the exchange rate is testing the crucial support zone around 1.3730-1.3725. This movement reflects an ongoing bearish sentiment in the market, driven by anticipation of upcoming macroeconomic data releases from both the US and Canada.

Traders are closely monitoring these economic indicators, as they could significantly impact the USD/CAD exchange rate. A break below the 1.3725 support could signal further declines, while any positive data could provide the necessary momentum for a rebound toward the 1.3800 level. The market remains poised for volatility as investors await fresh insights into the economic performance of both nations.

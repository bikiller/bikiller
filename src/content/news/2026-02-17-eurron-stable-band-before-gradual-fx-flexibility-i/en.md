The EUR/RON currency pair is expected to remain within a stable range as market participants anticipate a gradual increase in foreign exchange flexibility. ING’s Frantisek Taborsky forecasts that the National Bank of Romania will hold its key interest rate at 6.50% for the time being, despite ongoing high inflation. This decision is largely driven by inflationary pressures, which, although still elevated, are projected to ease by mid-year.

With inflation expected to decline, the EUR/RON exchange rate may see less volatility in the coming months. However, the Central Bank's cautious stance will likely keep the pair within its current trading band. The market is monitoring inflation trends closely, with the potential for adjustments depending on economic conditions. As inflation moderates, the RON could strengthen, but the outlook remains tied to broader economic factors and the pace of FX liberalization.

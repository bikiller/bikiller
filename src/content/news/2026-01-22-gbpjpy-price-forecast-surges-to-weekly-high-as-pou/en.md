GBP/JPY surged to a new weekly high of 213.98, marking an increase of over 1.10% for the week. The British Pound gained momentum, driven by mixed UK economic data that fueled optimism for the currency. Despite some uncertainty surrounding fiscal policies, the Pound continued to strengthen against the Japanese Yen, which struggled under the weight of concerns over Prime Minister Takaichi’s economic plan.

As of the latest trading session, the GBP/JPY exchange rate stands at 213.85, up 0.58% on the day. The Japanese Yen’s weakness has been exacerbated by ongoing fiscal doubts, while the Pound maintains its upward trajectory. Traders will be watching for further developments in both UK and Japanese economic policies as the currency pair approaches key technical levels.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) started the week with a cautious tone, trading in a mixed pattern against its major peers. On Monday, the GBP/USD exchange rate edged slightly higher, reaching 1.3665 as the market remained subdued ahead of a data-light week. Despite the modest gains, the currency pair faces a lack of fresh drivers to spark significant movement.

With little economic data on the horizon, GBP’s movement is expected to be influenced by broader market sentiment and external factors, such as global risk appetite and developments in other major currencies. The market is likely to maintain a cautious outlook until further direction emerges.

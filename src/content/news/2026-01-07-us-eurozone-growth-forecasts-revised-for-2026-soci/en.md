Société Générale has revised its 2026 GDP forecasts, projecting the US economy will grow by 2.1% and the Eurozone by 1.2%, an increase from prior estimates. Despite this positive outlook for economic growth, the USD has stabilized against the EUR rather than experiencing a rally, indicating that traders may be cautious amid ongoing market sentiment.

The current exchange rate dynamics reflect a complex interplay of factors influencing currency pairs. As the market digests these revised growth figures, the stability of the dollar suggests that traders are weighing global economic uncertainties against local growth potential. This development may signal a period of consolidation for the USD/EUR pair as investors reassess their strategies in light of the new data.

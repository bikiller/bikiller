EUR/USD continues to struggle near four-week lows, currently trading at 1.1690. The currency pair has maintained a soft tone as traders remain cautious ahead of significant U.S. macroeconomic data releases scheduled for later this week. Concerns over the potential impact of U.S. interventions in Venezuela further add to the uncertainty in the forex market.

Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate for any signs of recovery or further declines. The upcoming data could influence the outlook for the USD and shape trading sentiment for the EUR/USD pair. As traders assess the implications of the economic indicators, volatility may increase, prompting a reevaluation of positions in this key currency pair.

The U.S. dollar is expected to experience choppy trading within a range, as geopolitical factors and de-dollarisation pressures fail to significantly impact its exchange rate in the short term. Jane Foley of Rabobank suggests that the dollar’s role as a global reserve currency will continue to provide stability, limiting the likelihood of a sustained downward trend. 

EUR/USD is likely to remain volatile in the coming months, with fluctuations around current levels. While de-dollarisation concerns are rising, they are not yet substantial enough to drive a material shift in USD exchange rates. The dollar’s resilient reserve status will continue to support its value despite geopolitical pressures, with trading dynamics expected to stay within a relatively narrow range for now.

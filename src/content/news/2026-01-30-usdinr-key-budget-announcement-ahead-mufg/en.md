The Indian Rupee remains under pressure as USD/INR approaches the key 92.00 level. The currency pair continues to face selling pressure amidst rising capital outflows, which have weighed on the Rupee’s performance. With market sentiment fragile, traders are closely watching the upcoming FY2026/27 Budget announcement for signals on fiscal consolidation measures. 

The announcement could be pivotal for the Indian Rupee's outlook, as it will provide clarity on how the government plans to address fiscal deficits and manage inflation in the face of global challenges. A lack of strong measures could lead to further depreciation in USD/INR, with potential volatility around the 92.00 threshold. As the budget draws near, market participants will be paying close attention to any policy shifts that could impact the currency pair’s trading range.

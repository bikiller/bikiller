GBP/USD rose by 0.23% on Friday, as the US Supreme Court blocked President Trump’s tariffs, which were imposed under a law meant for national emergencies. This ruling added pressure on the US Dollar, weighing down the currency pair as traders reacted to the unexpected legal setback. The GBP/USD exchange rate saw a notable uptick, moving higher amidst the unfolding news.

The US Dollar also faced headwinds from a weaker-than-expected Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report.

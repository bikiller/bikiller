EUR/JPY has rebounded from recent losses, trading at approximately 183.20 during the Asian trading session on Friday. This recovery indicates a positive shift in momentum for the currency pair, as traders assess the impact of various economic factors on the exchange rate. The pair is now approaching the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA) barrier, which could serve as a critical resistance level.

The daily chart analysis reveals that the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 54, reflecting a neutral stance after previously reaching overbought conditions. This steady momentum suggests that while the market may be stabilizing, traders should remain vigilant for potential fluctuations in the EUR/JPY exchange rate as broader market trends unfold. The interplay of economic data and investor sentiment will likely influence future price movements in this currency pair.

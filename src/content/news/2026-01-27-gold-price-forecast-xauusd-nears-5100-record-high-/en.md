Gold (XAU/USD) has resumed its upward trajectory, approaching the all-time high of $5,100 amid growing economic uncertainties. The latest surge in the precious metal's price comes as concerns over a potential US government shutdown escalate, driving increased demand for safe-haven assets. Market participants are also anticipating further dovish moves from the Federal Reserve, which has contributed to the weakening of the USD.

The renewed optimism for gold comes alongside heightened trade tensions and geopolitical risks, fueling investor caution. As XAU/USD nears its record high, traders are closely watching how developments around US fiscal policy and global trade will impact the broader market. The current environment of low interest rates and risk aversion is expected to continue supporting gold's bullish outlook in the near term.

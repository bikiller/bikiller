The USD/JPY currency pair is seeing an uptick, with the exchange rate climbing to around 155.55 in the early hours of the Asian session on Tuesday. This movement comes as a result of positive economic data from the United States, providing fresh support to the US Dollar. The data has given the Greenback a boost, reinforcing its strength against the Japanese Yen.

The rise above the key technical level of 155.50 signals continued bullish momentum for the USD/JPY pair. Traders are closely monitoring the US economic performance, which could offer further support for the Dollar in the coming sessions. A sustained hold above this level could set the stage for further gains, while a potential pullback may see support near 155.00.

The Indian Rupee (INR) saw a sharp decline against the US Dollar (USD) during afternoon trading in India on Friday, with the USD/INR pair moving higher to approach the 90.85 mark. This reversal occurred despite the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) holding the key Repo Rate steady at 5.25%, aligning with market expectations. 

The recent market movement comes as the RBI Governor hinted at further rate cuts ahead, signaling potential dovish monetary policy shifts. As a result, the INR continues to face pressure, with traders keeping an eye on future rate decisions and their impact on the INR's performance. The 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) for USD/INR now serves as a key technical level to watch in the coming sessions.

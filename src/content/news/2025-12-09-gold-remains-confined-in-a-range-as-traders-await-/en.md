Gold (XAU/USD) has been under pressure for the third consecutive day, trading within a narrow range as market participants adopt a cautious stance ahead of the Federal Reserve's rate decision on Wednesday. Currently, the precious metal remains confined to a one-week trading range, with investors hesitant to make significant moves until more clarity is provided regarding the Fed's interest rate trajectory.

As the Asian trading session progresses, gold has shown limited bearish momentum, reflecting traders' reluctance to engage heavily before the FOMC announcement. This cautious sentiment is expected to persist in the lead-up to the decision, underpinning the current stability in the gold exchange rate. The focus remains on how the monetary policy outlook will shape market dynamics for both gold and broader currency pairs, including the USD and EUR.

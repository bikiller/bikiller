The USD/INR currency pair remains near its all-time high as trading opens on Friday. The Indian Rupee (INR) continues to struggle, holding onto its weekly losses against the US Dollar (USD) following the pair’s peak at 92.00 on Wednesday. Market sentiment indicates ongoing pressure on the Rupee as the Dollar maintains strength across the board.

Traders are watching closely as the extended weekend in India approaches, with the USD/INR pair poised to test further resistance levels. The Indian Rupee's struggles reflect broader trends in emerging markets, as a strong USD continues to dominate global forex trading. With the pair lingering near historic highs, volatility is expected to persist, especially with limited market activity ahead of the long weekend.

EUR/USD is showing little movement on Tuesday, trading steady near the 1.1770 mark as traders navigate a period of relative calm ahead of the New Year holiday. The exchange rate reflects a cautious sentiment in the market, influenced by rising geopolitical risks that are keeping participants on edge.

Investors are weighing the implications of global events on the USD and EUR, which could lead to renewed fluctuations in the exchange rate as the new year approaches.

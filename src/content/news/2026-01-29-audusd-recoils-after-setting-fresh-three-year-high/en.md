AUD/USD struggled to maintain momentum on Thursday, retreating from a fresh three-year high of 0.7093 as market volatility intensified. The Australian Dollar had initially surged, benefiting from broad risk appetite and improved commodity prices, but a shift in sentiment saw the currency pair reverse course. The exchange rate ended the day lower, hovering around 0.7050.

The sharp pullback in AUD/USD reflected broader market uncertainty, with riskier assets under pressure amid concerns over global economic stability. The US Dollar, meanwhile, was supported by rising Treasury yields and a stronger-than-expected economic outlook. Traders will be closely watching for any further shifts in risk sentiment as the pair remains within a critical support zone.

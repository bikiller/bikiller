The Japanese Yen (JPY) maintained a steady position amid safe-haven flows and ongoing intervention fears during the early European session on Monday. The currency's bullish bias is evident, yet its strength is tempered by mixed market forces, resulting in cautious trading. As traders assess geopolitical tensions and economic indicators, the JPY remains a focal point for investors seeking stability.

In contrast, the USD/JPY currency pair shows limited movement around the 150.00 level, reflecting a lack of follow-through in bullish momentum. The EUR/JPY also remains under pressure as market participants weigh the implications of potential monetary policy changes from the Bank of Japan. This interplay of market sentiment and technical levels suggests that while the yen holds firm, significant volatility may loom if intervention becomes a reality.

The USD/CAD currency pair has paused its four-day losing streak, trading around 1.3790 during European hours on Friday. The pair managed to stabilize as the US Dollar (USD) regained some of the losses from the previous session. This recovery follows a decrease in geopolitical and trade tensions between the United States and Europe, which provided some relief to the USD.

Traders are now focusing on upcoming US data, particularly the US Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which could further impact the USD/CAD exchange rate. A stronger PMI could fuel USD gains, while a weaker reading may lead to renewed pressure on the greenback. With the pair holding steady near 1.3800, all eyes are on the broader market trends as the US Dollar seeks to solidify its position ahead of key economic reports.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a notable decline of 1.75%, falling below the $79.50 mark to around $79.30 per troy ounce during European trading hours on Wednesday. This decrease comes after a three-day rally, as investors took the opportunity to lock in profits following the metal's ascent toward record highs.

The pullback in silver prices highlights the impact of profit-taking among traders and signals a shift in market sentiment. With the recent surge, the currency pair has attracted significant attention, but the current dip may prompt investors to reassess their positions. Continued volatility in the precious metals market could influence broader trading strategies involving USD and other currencies.

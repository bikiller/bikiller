The Indian Rupee (INR) opened the week on a bearish note against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR exchange rate rising amid persistent selling from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). This trend reflects a growing concern over the impact of the Reserve Bank of India's dovish policy stance, which continues to influence market sentiment and currency trading dynamics.

As investors react to the ongoing FII selling pressure, the INR's weakness highlights broader economic challenges. The USD's strength in the currency pair is further supported by robust economic data from the United States, exacerbating the INR's decline. Market participants will be closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators, as shifts in sentiment could lead to increased volatility in the exchange rate in the coming days.

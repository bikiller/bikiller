The EUR/USD currency pair has seen a slight rebound during the Asian session on Friday, edging higher to the mid-1.1600s. This upward movement comes as dip-buyers step in following a dip from the 1.1680 mark, which was the highest level since October 17. The recent price action indicates a potential recovery after the prior day's retracement.

Traders are now looking ahead to the upcoming US PCE Price Index data for fresh trading impetus. As the market anticipates this critical economic indicator, the exchange rate will likely be influenced by shifts in investor sentiment towards inflationary pressures in the U.S. economy, which could further impact the USD and provide direction for the EUR/USD pair.

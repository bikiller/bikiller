EUR/USD weakened on Thursday as the US Dollar gained strength amid expectations of a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The currency pair eased to 1.1794, pulling back from a daily high of 1.1829. The USD's rally was driven by speculation that the Fed might reduce rates in the near future, which weighed on the Euro.

The Eurozone also faces economic concerns, with recent data showing sluggish growth, further pressuring EUR/USD. As the USD continues to benefit from the Fed outlook, the Euro remains vulnerable. Traders are now eyeing key support levels around 1.1750, with a potential further decline if the USD's bullish momentum persists.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) remained stagnant against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, trading within a tight range as the market navigates the end-of-year slowdown. With many traders sidelined during this final trading week of 2025, the exchange rate shows little movement, reflecting a lack of catalysts to drive significant price action.

As liquidity diminishes, the CAD/USD currency pair has struggled to gain traction, with most participants adopting a cautious stance. This subdued trading environment has left the CAD vulnerable to external influences, particularly as economic indicators from major economies like the US and the Eurozone continue to shape market sentiment. The absence of volatility underscores a broader trend in year-end trading, where investors typically avoid making bold moves.

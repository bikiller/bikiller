The USD/INR currency pair has opened the last week of 2025 on a slightly weaker note, with the Indian Rupee (INR) trading lower against the US Dollar (USD). This movement can be attributed to increased demand for US Dollars from Indian importers, who are looking to replenish their inventories ahead of the year-end. As the exchange rate fluctuates, market participants are keeping a close eye on how this demand impacts the overall forex landscape.

As traders navigate the market, the USD/INR exchange rate remains sensitive to external factors, including global economic conditions and domestic demand pressures. Importers' heightened need for USD adds upward pressure on the currency pair, suggesting a potential for further fluctuations in the exchange rate. With ongoing trading activity, the market is poised to respond to any significant shifts in demand, providing opportunities for forex investors.

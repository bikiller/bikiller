The EUR/USD currency pair is holding steady around the exchange rate of 1.1625 during the early European session on Wednesday. Traders are adopting a cautious stance as they await the U.S. Federal Reserve's interest rate decision later today. Currently, the market has almost fully priced in a 25 basis points (bps) rate cut, leading to a subdued trading atmosphere.

As the Fed's announcement approaches, the focus remains on how the decision might impact the USD. Any deviation from the anticipated rate cut could lead to significant market volatility, influencing the EUR/USD exchange rate. Investors are keenly observing the Fed's commentary for clues on future monetary policy direction, which could further affect the trading dynamics of this key currency pair.

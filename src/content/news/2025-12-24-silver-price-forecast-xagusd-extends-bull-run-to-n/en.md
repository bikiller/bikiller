Silver prices (XAG/USD) continued their upward momentum, reaching approximately $72.70 during early European trading on Wednesday. This rally can be attributed to ongoing dovish sentiment surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, with traders betting on a slower pace of interest rate hikes. The strong demand for silver is further fueled by its appeal as a hedge against inflation in uncertain economic times.

As the currency pair approaches this key technical level, market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate for potential breakout signals. Should XAG/USD maintain its bullish trajectory, it could pave the way for further gains. Conversely, a pullback may occur if the Fed shifts its stance or if economic indicators suggest a stronger USD. Traders are advised to stay vigilant as market dynamics continue to evolve.

EUR/GBP has trimmed its recent losses, stabilizing around the 0.8710 mark during the early European session on Thursday. The currency pair, which had been on a downward trajectory, regained some ground as the Pound Sterling (GBP) weakened following the disappointing release of the UK’s GDP data. This shift in the exchange rate reflects the market's reaction to weaker-than-expected growth figures, which prompted a selloff in GBP.

The UK’s GDP growth numbers fell short of forecasts, causing investors to reassess the strength of the British economy. As a result, the EUR/GBP exchange rate found support near the 0.8700 level, with the Euro (EUR) benefiting from the GBP's decline. With the pair trading close to 0.8710, traders are likely to keep a close eye on upcoming data and broader market sentiment, which will determine the next directional move for EUR/GBP.

Oil markets are showing *breakout potential* as traders weigh inventories and rising geopolitical risks. BNY’s Head of Markets Macro Strategy says oil and gasoline stock levels — especially U.S. crude data — are focal points for near‑term price direction, with recent inventory reports suggesting a tightening bias that could shift sentiment in energy and related forex flows. The U.S. dollar’s strength against major currency pairs such as USD/EUR and USD/JPY continues to influence commodity‑linked FX trading as markets price in risk premia. 

Adding to the mix, warnings from U.S. officials about Venezuela have amplified supply concerns after sanctions and political turmoil threaten output from a major crude producer. This backdrop has kept Brent and WTI prices in focus, prompting risk‑off trading in energy‑linked US–Venezuela frictions have halted crude’s descent below the $55 mark amid mounting supply-glut risks for 2026. Prices remain in a neutral-to-bearish hold until key breakout levels are confirmed.

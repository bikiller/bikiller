The EUR/USD currency pair has dropped below the 1.170 mark as the U.S. dollar gains momentum. This shift can be attributed to a resurgence in USD buying interest amid easing geopolitical tariff tensions. ING’s FX analyst Francesco Pesole highlights that the renewed strength of the dollar has prompted traders to reassess their positions in this exchange rate.

As the dollar strengthens, market participants are closely monitoring the implications for the euro. The decline below 1.170 signals potential challenges for the eurozone's currency, suggesting a more cautious approach from traders. The current dynamics in the forex market underline the importance of geopolitical developments and their impact on currency trading strategies.

The US Dollar (USD) is experiencing mixed trading activity as it hovers just below its 200-day moving average. With 10-year Treasury yields testing the upper end of the 3.95%-4.20% range established since September, market participants are closely monitoring any potential shifts that could influence the USD's performance against major currency pairs.

Meanwhile, US equity futures remain relatively stable as investors await cues from the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The interplay between Treasury yields and equity markets suggests a cautious sentiment among traders, who are assessing the implications of possible monetary policy adjustments on the USD's exchange rate with the euro (EUR) and other currencies. As the market awaits clearer direction, volatility may increase in the lead-up to key economic announcements.

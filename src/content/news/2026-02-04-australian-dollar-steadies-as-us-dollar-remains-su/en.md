The Australian Dollar (AUD) held steady against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, maintaining its position after a strong rally the previous day. The AUD/USD pair advanced following a 1% surge in the prior session, supported by positive data from China. The country's Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 52.3 in January, up from 52.0 in December, signaling growth in the sector.

Despite the strength in the AUD, the US Dollar remained subdued as traders awaited key economic data. Market attention is focused on the upcoming ISM Services PMI release, which could offer further insight into the health of the US economy. As the AUD/USD pair trades near key levels, the market's reaction to the data could determine the near-term direction for this currency pair.

The USD/JPY currency pair saw a recovery after the initial post-election selloff, which followed Prime Minister Takaichi's landslide victory in Japan’s elections. The pair, which had fallen to a low of 156.20 earlier in the day, rebounded to the 156.70 mark, regaining some of the losses. Despite this bounce, the USD/JPY remains down by 0.3% on the day, indicating limited upside momentum.

The Japanese Yen initially gained strength following the election results, with traders responding to potential political stability. However, the US Dollar found technical support around 156.20, preventing further losses. The price action highlights the ongoing volatility in the USD/JPY exchange rate as market participants digest both domestic and international factors influencing the currency pair.

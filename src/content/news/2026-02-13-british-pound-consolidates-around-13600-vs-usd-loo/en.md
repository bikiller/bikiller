The British Pound remains steady against the US Dollar, with the GBP/USD exchange rate holding above the 1.3600 level during Friday's Asian session. Despite some pressure, the currency pair is showing limited downside momentum, suggesting that traders are adopting a cautious stance ahead of key economic data.

Market participants are waiting for the release of the US consumer inflation figures, which could provide fresh market direction. Any surprises in the data could trigger significant moves in the currency pair, as investors look for clues on future Federal Reserve policy actions. With the current trading around 1.3600, the Pound's next move will likely be shaped by the US CPI outcome.

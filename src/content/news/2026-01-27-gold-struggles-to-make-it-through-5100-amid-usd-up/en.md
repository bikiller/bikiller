Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward trajectory for the seventh consecutive day on Tuesday, but the precious metal struggles to breach the $5,100 mark. Despite maintaining a bid tone, gold faces resistance in pushing past this level, remaining below its all-time high during the first half of the European trading session. 

The uptick in the USD exchange rate appears to limit gold's momentum, as the stronger greenback weighs on demand for the safe-haven asset. While the bullish bias remains intact, traders are closely watching for any potential breakthrough above $5,100, which could signal a continuation of the upward trend in gold prices. The EUR/USD currency pair also remains under pressure, reflecting broader market sentiment.

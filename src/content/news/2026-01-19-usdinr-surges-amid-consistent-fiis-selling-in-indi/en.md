The Indian Rupee (INR) has begun the week on a weak note against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR currency pair surging to a near all-time high of 91.55. This significant movement reflects the INR’s struggles in the face of persistent selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian equity market. 

As the INR continues to underperform against major currencies, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics. The sustained outflow of capital from Indian equities is raising concerns about the currency's stability, compelling market participants to reassess their positions. This trend highlights the ongoing challenges for the Indian economy amidst global market fluctuations.

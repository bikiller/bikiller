Nomura analysts expect Eurozone inflation to stay close to the European Central Bank's 2.0% target through 2027, with GDP growth returning to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2026. This stability is seen as maintaining EUR/USD exchange rates in a tight range, potentially limiting market volatility in the short term. 

However, the firm warns of inflation risks skewed to the upside, predicting that a sharp price rise may occur in 2028, which could prompt a series of interest rate hikes. Such a scenario would likely push the EUR/USD higher, as markets adjust to tighter monetary policies from the ECB. Traders will need to monitor economic indicators closely for any early signs of this shift.

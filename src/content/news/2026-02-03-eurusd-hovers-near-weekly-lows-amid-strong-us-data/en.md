The EUR/USD currency pair has slipped below 1.1800, reversing earlier gains and currently trading at 1.1780. This drop comes as stronger-than-expected US economic data supports the USD, adding pressure to the Euro. The greenback's strength is particularly noticeable following positive US economic reports that raised expectations of a faster recovery.

In addition to US data, market participants are factoring in a new trade deal between India and the United States. This agreement boosts USD sentiment, further weighing on EUR/USD. As the pair hovers near weekly lows, traders are closely watching for any further developments in US economic performance, which could influence the exchange rate in the short term.

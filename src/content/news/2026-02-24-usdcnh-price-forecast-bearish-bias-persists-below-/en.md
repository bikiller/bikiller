The USD/CNH currency pair is experiencing modest gains, trading at 6.8905 during early European hours on Tuesday. Despite the slight upward movement, the pair remains constrained by broader market conditions, trading near a 34-month low. The persistence of a bearish bias is evident, with the pair facing limited upside potential amid ongoing trade tensions and uncertainties surrounding US tariffs.

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) kept its Loan Prime Rate (LPR) unchanged, maintaining stability in its monetary policy. This decision, coupled with the USD’s struggles, contributes to the pair’s subdued movement. As the USD/CNH trades below the 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), the bearish outlook continues to dominate, with traders eyeing further downside risks unless significant shifts in market sentiment occur.

The EUR/JPY currency pair continues to show strength, trading above the key level of 185.00 for the third consecutive day. During the early European session on Tuesday, the exchange rate hovered around 185.20, reflecting a bullish momentum that has characterized this cross. Traders are closely monitoring this upward movement, signaling potential further gains in the short term.

This sustained performance above 185.00 suggests a robust demand for the euro against the yen, which could be attributed to shifting market sentiments and economic data releases. As the forex market reacts to global developments, the ability of EUR/JPY to maintain its current levels may encourage further buying activity, potentially leading to a test of higher resistance levels in the coming sessions.

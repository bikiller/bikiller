The GBP/USD currency pair is facing upward momentum, though questions remain over whether it can break past the resistance at 1.3570. According to UOB Group's FX analysts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, while the Pound Sterling shows positive potential, it may lack sufficient strength to overcome this key technical level in the near term.

Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate's movement as it struggles to maintain upward momentum against the USD. Despite bullish sentiment, there is uncertainty surrounding the Pound's ability to sustain momentum and break through 1.3570, which could signal a stronger rally. Without further catalysts, GBP/USD may face challenges in maintaining upward pressure.

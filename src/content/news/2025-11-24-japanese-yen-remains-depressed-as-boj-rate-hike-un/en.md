The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle against a stronger US Dollar (USD), with current trading showing the JPY under pressure as concerns about Japan's fiscal health mount. As of the Asian trading session, the USD/JPY exchange rate reflects this weakness, with the Yen appearing vulnerable to further declines. 

Market sentiment remains cautious amid ongoing uncertainty regarding potential interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Investors are weighing the implications of Japan’s fiscal challenges, which could hinder any aggressive monetary tightening. As a result, the JPY's outlook appears bleak, particularly if the USD maintains its strength against major currencies.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) declined early in Asian trading on Tuesday, slipping below the $4,300 mark as traders engaged in profit-taking and faced weak long liquidation from short-term futures positions. The retreat in the gold market reflects shifting sentiment, with investors reassessing their positions ahead of key economic data from the U.S.

Additionally, growing optimism surrounding potential peace talks in Ukraine is contributing to the downward pressure on gold, traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset. As traders await the upcoming U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) release, the market remains cautious, with the potential for further fluctuations in the exchange rate as economic indicators come into focus.

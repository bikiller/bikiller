The US Dollar Index (DXY) is maintaining its upward momentum, trading around 98.90 during the Asian session on Friday. This marks the fourth consecutive day of gains for the DXY, which reflects the USD's strength against a basket of six major currencies. As traders gear up for the upcoming Nonfarm Payrolls report, the index is inching closer to the key psychological level of 99.00.

Market analysts attribute the DXY's rise to positive sentiment surrounding the US economy, with expectations of robust job growth bolstering the USD’s appeal. In the currency markets, pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY are showing notable fluctuations as investors react to the strengthening dollar, potentially setting the stage for further volatility as the data release approaches.

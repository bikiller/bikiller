The Indian Rupee (INR) is experiencing significant selling pressure against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR currency pair reaching a record high of approximately 90.80 during Thursday's afternoon trading session in India. This surge in the exchange rate comes amid growing uncertainty surrounding ongoing trade negotiations between the United States and India, raising concerns among investors.

Market analysts suggest that the deterioration in trade talks has spurred fears over economic stability, leading to increased demand for the dollar as a safe-haven asset. As the rupee struggles to maintain its value, traders are closely monitoring developments in the US-India trade discussions, as further escalations could exacerbate the downward pressure on the INR and influence broader market sentiment.

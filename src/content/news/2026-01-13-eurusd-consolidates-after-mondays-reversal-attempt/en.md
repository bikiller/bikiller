The Euro (EUR) is experiencing a period of consolidation against the US Dollar (USD), trading within a narrow range as market participants assess the recent price action. Following a bullish reversal attempt on Monday, the currency pair has shown resilience but remains flat as traders evaluate potential implications for future movements. 

Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, note that this sideways trading comes after a pullback from mid to late December. The exchange rate dynamics suggest that investors are closely monitoring technical levels, waiting for clearer signals that could dictate the next directional move in the EUR/USD pair.

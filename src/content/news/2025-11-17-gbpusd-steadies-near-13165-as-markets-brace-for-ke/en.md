The Pound Sterling is holding steady against the US Dollar during the North American trading session, with the GBP/USD exchange rate hovering around 1.3166. This stability comes as traders brace for the upcoming US jobs report, traditionally released on Thursdays alongside Initial Jobless Claims data, which is anticipated to influence market sentiment.

As the market prepares for potentially impactful employment figures, the exchange rate remains virtually unchanged, highlighting a cautious approach among investors. The focus on labor market indicators suggests that any significant movement in the currency pair could arise from the report, as traders assess its implications for future monetary policy and overall economic health.

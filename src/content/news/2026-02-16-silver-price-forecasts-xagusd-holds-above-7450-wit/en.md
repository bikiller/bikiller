Silver (XAG/USD) remains under pressure, trading just below $77.00 on Monday. The metal is edging closer to last week’s lows of $74.50, as bearish sentiment gains traction. The currency pair’s movement suggests a potential test of key support levels, with market participants closely watching for any further decline.

The silver price’s struggles reflect broader market dynamics, including strength in the USD, which has weighed on precious metals. With silver holding above $74.50, traders will be monitoring for a potential breakdown or a rebound. A breach of this support could see further downside, while a recovery above $77.00 would signal renewed bullish momentum.

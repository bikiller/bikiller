Stronger exports from Asia in early 2026 have provided significant support for regional currencies, according to Michael Wan, MUFG’s Senior Currency Analyst. Despite ongoing concerns about potential US tariff investigations under the Trump administration, the strength in exports has helped maintain positive momentum for currencies like the Japanese yen (JPY) and the South Korean won (KRW). The increased export activity is boosting investor confidence in Asia's economic outlook, stabilizing exchange rates.

However, the looming threat of new tariffs from the US continues to introduce uncertainty. Traders are closely monitoring any developments that could affect the USD/JPY and USD/KRW pairs, particularly if trade tensions escalate. As export growth remains robust, regional currencies are likely to stay resilient against the dollar, with the EUR/USD pair trading around 1.07 and market participants seeking more clarity on the future of US foreign policy. The interplay between exports and tariffs will be key to shaping currency trends in the coming months.

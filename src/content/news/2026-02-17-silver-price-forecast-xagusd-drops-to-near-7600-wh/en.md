Silver (XAG/USD) has seen a decline in price, dropping to near $76.00 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday. The precious metal is facing slight pressure as market participants await the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. The drop comes despite January’s US inflation data showing signs of cooling, leaving dovish expectations for the Federal Reserve largely intact.

The ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Fed's monetary policy continues to weigh on silver prices. While inflationary pressures in the US appear to be easing, the market remains cautious about future rate hikes. Investors are keeping a close eye on the upcoming FOMC minutes, which could offer further insights into the central bank's stance, potentially influencing the XAG/USD exchange rate in the near term.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) have dipped 0.5% to around $4,052.00 in Thursday’s European trading session, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. The decline comes as traders reduce their expectations for an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the upcoming December policy meeting, leading to increased selling pressure on the precious metal.

The adjustment in Fed rate cut bets has implications for the broader market, particularly influencing the USD's exchange rate against other currencies. As traders reassess their positions, the shifting dynamics may continue to affect gold prices, prompting further volatility in the XAU/USD pair as the market awaits additional economic signals.

The GBP/USD exchange rate has shown signs of weakness, with the British Pound slightly underperforming against most G10 currencies. Despite hawkish signals from Bank of England (BoE) official Catherine Mann, who indicated a reluctance for further monetary easing, the Pound has struggled to gain traction. The currency pair is trading lower, reflecting ongoing political uncertainty in the UK, which continues to weigh on investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, the USD remains strong, bolstered by robust economic data and a favorable interest rate outlook. The Pound's lack of upward momentum contrasts with the broader market strength of the Greenback. Technical levels suggest that GBP/USD faces resistance at 1.2100, while support remains near 1.2000. This reflects the prevailing caution in the market, as traders weigh the implications of BoE's stance amid domestic political challenges.

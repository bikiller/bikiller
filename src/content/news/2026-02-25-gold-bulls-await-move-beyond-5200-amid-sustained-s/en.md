Gold (XAU/USD) is struggling to sustain momentum above the key $5,200 level as it heads into the European session on Wednesday. Despite reaching a monthly high the previous day, the precious metal faces difficulty in gaining further traction amid market uncertainty. Investors continue to favor gold as a safe-haven asset, but the bullish trend has yet to break past the $5,200 resistance.

The weaker USD remains a key factor supporting gold prices. As the greenback continues to soften, risk-off sentiment is driving demand for gold, though the currency pair struggles to build on recent gains. Traders are keenly watching for any breakout above the $5,200 mark, which could signal a continuation of the uptrend in the coming sessions.

This week’s trading activity is expected to be subdued as the Thanksgiving holiday approaches, particularly for US markets. Typically, thin liquidity begins to set in by Wednesday afternoon, limiting market movements. Despite this, the USD remains in a strong position, maintaining its dominance against major currency pairs.

The exchange rate for EUR/USD continues to reflect this trend, with the pair trading around 1.05. Traders are closely monitoring technical levels, as the USD’s resilience could influence market sentiment and trading strategies leading into the holiday. As participants adjust their positions ahead of the long weekend, the potential for volatility remains, albeit within a constrained trading environment.

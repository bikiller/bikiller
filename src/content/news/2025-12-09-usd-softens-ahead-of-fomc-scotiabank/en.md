The US Dollar (USD) has softened in early trading, retracing some of yesterday's gains as markets prepare for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decision. This adjustment reflects a broader hesitation among traders, with the USD/EUR exchange rate showing signs of fluctuation. Investors are closely watching key technical levels, anticipating potential shifts based on the FOMC's policy stance.

As the FOMC meeting approaches, traders are adopting a cautious approach, with the USD experiencing varying levels of volatility. The currency pair's movements suggest that market participants are weighing the implications of interest rate decisions. A more dovish tone from the FOMC could further impact the USD, potentially leading to increased trading activity across major currency pairs like the EUR/USD.

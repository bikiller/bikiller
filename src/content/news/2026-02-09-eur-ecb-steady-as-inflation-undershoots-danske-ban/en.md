Euro area inflation cooled further in January, with headline prices slowing to 1.7% year on year and core inflation easing to 2.2%, according to Danske Bank. The undershoot versus the ECB’s target reinforced a dovish backdrop for the EUR, yet policymakers left the deposit rate unchanged at 2.00%, a decision fully priced by FX trading desks.

The steady stance limited immediate volatility in major currency pairs, with EUR/USD holding within recent ranges as traders weighed softer inflation against the ECB’s reluctance to pre-commit to rate cuts. The exchange rate reaction suggested markets are waiting for clearer guidance, especially as USD moves remain driven by relative growth and interest rate expectations rather than euro zone data alone.

For the near term, the inflation miss keeps pressure on the euro, but the lack of policy follow-through reduced downside momentum. Traders are likely to focus on upcoming ECB communication and US data for direction, with technical trading levels in EUR/USD acting as short-term anchors. Overall, the balance of risks points to range-bound EUR trading against the USD until policy divergence becomes clearer.

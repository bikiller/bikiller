EUR/USD is holding firm, trading above session highs of 1.1740, reflecting a rally of over 1% in the past two days. The recent rise in the exchange rate can be attributed to positive sentiment from the ZEW Economic Sentiment Survey, which boosted investor confidence in the Euro while the US Dollar faced downward pressure.

The ongoing "Sell America" trade has contributed to the USD's reversal, as traders reassess their positions. As the Euro strengthens, market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could further influence the currency pair's trajectory in the coming sessions.

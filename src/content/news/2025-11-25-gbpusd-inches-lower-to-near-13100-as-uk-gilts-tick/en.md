The GBP/USD currency pair experienced a slight decline, trading near the 1.3100 level during the Asian session on Tuesday. This dip marks a reversal after three consecutive days of gains for the Pound Sterling. The downward movement in the exchange rate can be attributed to a decrease in UK 10-year Gilt yields, which fell to 4.54%, reflecting shifting investor sentiment.

As traders look ahead to the upcoming budget announcement on November 26, uncertainty looms over the UK economy. The decrease in Gilt yields suggests a cautious approach among investors, impacting the overall demand for GBP. Analysts will be closely monitoring how these developments influence the currency pair and the broader market as traders position themselves ahead of potential economic shifts.

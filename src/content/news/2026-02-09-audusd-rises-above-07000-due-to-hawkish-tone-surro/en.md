The AUD/USD currency pair continues its upward trajectory, advancing for the second consecutive session and trading near 0.7020 during the Asian session on Monday. This rise is primarily driven by a hawkish shift in the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) outlook, which has spurred demand for the Australian dollar.

As the RBA signals a more aggressive stance on interest rates, market participants are adjusting their positions, pushing the AUD/USD exchange rate above the key 0.7000 level. This momentum could potentially set the stage for further bullish movement, depending on upcoming economic data and RBA policy decisions.

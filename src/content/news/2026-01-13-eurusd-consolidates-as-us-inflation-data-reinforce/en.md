The Euro (EUR) maintained its strength against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, reflecting a stable trading environment as investors digested the latest US inflation figures. At approximately 1.1667, the EUR/USD currency pair is in a consolidation phase, showing limited volatility despite a generally firmer tone from the Greenback. 

Market participants remain cautious as the inflation data reinforces expectations of a measured approach from the Federal Reserve. This cautious outlook on future monetary policy may contribute to maintaining the current exchange rate levels, allowing traders to reassess their positions before any significant movements occur.

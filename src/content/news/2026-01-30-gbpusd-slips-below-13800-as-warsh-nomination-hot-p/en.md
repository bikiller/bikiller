The GBP/USD currency pair dipped below the 1.3800 mark on Friday as the US Dollar strengthened following the announcement of Kevin Warsh as the new Federal Reserve chair under the Trump administration. This nomination spurred expectations of a more hawkish Fed, supporting the USD's appeal across the forex market.

Further bolstering the Greenback, a hot producer price index (PPI) report indicated rising inflation pressures, adding to market concerns over tightening monetary policy.

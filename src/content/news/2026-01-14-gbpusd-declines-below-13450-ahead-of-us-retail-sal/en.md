The GBP/USD currency pair has slipped below the 1.3450 mark, currently trading around 1.3425 during the Asian session on Wednesday. This decline is largely driven by a resurgence in demand for the US Dollar (USD), as traders prepare for the imminent release of key economic indicators, including US Retail Sales and the Producer Price Index (PPI).

Market participants are closely monitoring these upcoming data points, which are expected to provide insights into the health of the US economy. A stronger performance in these reports could further bolster the USD, potentially exerting additional downward pressure on the GBP/USD exchange rate. As such, traders remain vigilant, ready to react to any shifts in market sentiment.

The USD/JPY currency pair sees modest gains, trading just shy of 158.50 as the Asian session unfolds on Friday. The exchange rate hovers around 158.45, reflecting a softening of the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the US Dollar (USD). This movement comes in response to the latest Japanese inflation data, which failed to show any significant shift, allowing the USD to retain strength.

As traders await the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) rate decision, the JPY's weakness could persist, keeping the USD/JPY pair supported near current levels. A hawkish stance from the BoJ might provide volatility, while any dovish surprises could push the pair further up. At the moment, the 158.50 level remains a key technical resistance for the pair in the short term.

The EUR/USD currency pair remains resilient, with recent analysis from ING highlighting a divergence in volatility metrics. One-month realized volatility has dipped to a mere 4.8%, suggesting a period of stability. However, the one-month traded volatility has surged to 6.5%, indicating increasing market activity and potential price movements in the near term.

This uptick in trading volatility could reflect shifting investor sentiment and market dynamics, likely influenced by upcoming economic data and geopolitical developments. As traders navigate these fluctuations, the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar could experience significant shifts, prompting careful monitoring of key levels for potential trading opportunities.

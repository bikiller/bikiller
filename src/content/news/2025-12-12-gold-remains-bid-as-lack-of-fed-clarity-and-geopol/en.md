Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a modest upward trend on Friday, buoyed by ongoing uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's policies and heightened geopolitical tensions. The precious metal is up over 0.51%, reaching a seven-week high of $4,353 before settling at $4,302 as traders take profits ahead of the weekend.

Market participants are closely monitoring remarks from Fed officials, which are influencing trading sentiment. As uncertainty in the U.S. monetary policy persists, the demand for gold as a safe-haven asset remains robust, reflecting a broader caution in the currency markets. The exchange rate dynamics in the USD and EUR pairs could further impact gold's trajectory, making it a focal point for traders looking to navigate the volatile landscape.

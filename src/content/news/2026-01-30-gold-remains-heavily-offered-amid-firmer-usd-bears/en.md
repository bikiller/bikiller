Gold (XAU/USD) faced significant selling pressure on Friday, continuing a trend from the previous day’s volatile trading. The precious metal's decline is largely attributed to a firmer USD, which has strengthened amid a backdrop of consistent record highs over the past two weeks. Traders are now closely monitoring the $5,100 mark, with bears anticipating a potential break below this critical level.

As the exchange rate for gold dips, market participants are reassessing their positions, with heightened liquidation activity impacting overall trading sentiment. The current dynamics suggest that the bullish momentum seen earlier may be faltering, and if the bears succeed in pushing below $5,100, further downside could be expected. The ongoing strength of the USD and its implications for gold prices will be crucial for traders in the coming sessions.

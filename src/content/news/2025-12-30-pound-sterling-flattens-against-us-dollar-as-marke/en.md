The Pound Sterling (GBP) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) during the European trading session on Tuesday, hovering around the 1.3500 mark. This comes after the currency pair recently approached a three-month high of 1.3535, reached last week. Market participants are closely monitoring the situation as they await the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes, which could provide further insights into monetary policy direction.

The current exchange rate reflects a cautious sentiment among traders, as they assess the implications of potential changes in US interest rates. With the GBP/USD pair remaining near key technical levels, any indications from the FOMC minutes could significantly influence market movement. Investors are keenly focused on how these developments will impact future trading strategies and the overall strength of the Dollar against other currencies such as the Euro (EUR).

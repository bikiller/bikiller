Silver prices surged during Asian trading on Monday, with XAG/USD climbing to nearly $75.40. This spike is attributed to heightened safe-haven demand following the United States' military action against Venezuela. Investors are turning to precious metals as geopolitical tensions create uncertainty in the markets.

The increase in silver's value reflects broader market movements, as traders seek stability amid the turmoil. As the currency pair XAG/USD gains momentum, analysts suggest that continued unrest could further elevate its exchange rate, signaling a potential bullish trend for silver in the short term. The situation underscores the impact of global events on forex trading, particularly for safe-haven assets like silver.

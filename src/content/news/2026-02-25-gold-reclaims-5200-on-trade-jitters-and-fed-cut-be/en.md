Gold prices surged over 1% on Wednesday, rebounding to $5,204 after dipping to $5,121 earlier. The recovery came as investor sentiment was driven by rising uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policies and expectations that the Federal Reserve will continue its dovish stance for the remainder of the year. This created safe-haven demand for the precious metal, with traders betting on potential Fed rate cuts.

The renewed strength in XAU/USD is a direct response to growing concerns in the forex market. As the dollar (USD) weakens, particularly against the euro (EUR), gold has benefited from both geopolitical risks and expectations of softer U.S. monetary policy. These factors combined are pushing gold prices higher, and traders are watching for further signs of Fed action, which could set the tone for market dynamics in the weeks ahead.

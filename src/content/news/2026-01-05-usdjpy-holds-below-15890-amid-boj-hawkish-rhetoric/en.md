The USD/JPY currency pair remains under pressure, trading below the critical resistance level of 158.90, despite the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) recent hawkish rhetoric. The exchange rate has been capped by a recent double-top formation, indicating strong selling interest at this level. BOJ Governor Ueda emphasized that interest rates are set to rise as economic conditions improve, yet they still remain below the neutral range of 1–2.5%.

This cautious approach from the BOJ suggests that while the central bank is leaning towards tightening monetary policy, it is not ready to take aggressive action just yet. Market participants are closely monitoring the situation, as any shifts in the BOJ's stance could lead to increased volatility in the USD/JPY exchange rate. As traders weigh these developments, the outlook for the yen remains closely tied to Ueda's comments and the overall economic landscape in Japan.

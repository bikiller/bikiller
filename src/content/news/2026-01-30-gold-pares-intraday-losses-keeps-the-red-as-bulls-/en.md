Gold (XAU/USD) has managed to recover some of its substantial intraday losses, currently hovering around the $5,100 mark. However, the yellow metal remains under pressure as bulls exhibit caution amidst a modest rebound in the USD. This comes after a remarkable surge of over 25% since the beginning of the month, marked by a series of record highs.

The recent volatility in gold can be attributed to the strengthening of the US dollar, which has affected the exchange rate dynamics. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as the gold market grapples with the implications of sustained USD strength on future price movements. As market sentiment remains tentative, gold investors are likely to stay vigilant.

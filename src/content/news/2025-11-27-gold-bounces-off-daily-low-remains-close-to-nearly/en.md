Gold (XAU/USD) has bounced back from its daily low, yet it maintains a slightly negative outlook as it approaches the European session. Currently, gold is hovering near a two-week high, driven by growing speculation surrounding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. This sentiment continues to influence market dynamics, keeping traders cautious as they assess the implications for the precious metal.

The ongoing fluctuations in the exchange rate reflect broader concerns in the forex market, particularly among USD and EUR traders. As traders weigh the impact of Fed policies on gold prices, the interplay of interest rates and inflation expectations could provide further volatility. With gold's resilience amid negative factors, market participants will be closely monitoring developments that could affect its trajectory in the coming sessions.

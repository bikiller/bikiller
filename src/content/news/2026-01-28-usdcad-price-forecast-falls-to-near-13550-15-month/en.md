The USD/CAD currency pair fell to near 1.3550, marking its lowest level in 15 months. This move followed a decline of nearly 1% in the previous trading session, with the exchange rate hovering around 1.3570 during the European hours on Wednesday. The recent drop highlights a sustained weakening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar.

The market sentiment continues to favor the CAD, supported by higher oil prices and expectations of tightening from the Bank of Canada. As the USD remains under pressure, traders are closely monitoring upcoming economic data and central bank signals that may further influence the direction of the currency pair. The 1.3550 support level is now in focus, with a potential break signaling deeper losses for the USD.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to nearly seven-week highs, breaching the $4,325 mark during early European trading on Monday. This upward momentum is largely fueled by growing expectations of interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve (Fed) in the coming year, as traders anticipate a shift in monetary policy that could impact the exchange rate of the USD.

The rising demand for gold reflects not only speculative trading but also safe-haven flows, as investors seek stability amid potential economic uncertainty. As the market weighs the implications of a softer Fed stance, the precious metal’s ascent may continue, influencing broader currency movements, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies.

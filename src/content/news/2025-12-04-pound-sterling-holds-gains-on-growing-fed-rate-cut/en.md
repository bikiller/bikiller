The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthened against major currencies on Thursday, building on gains from Wednesday as traders reacted positively to the UK budget announcement made on November 26. The GBP/USD exchange rate reflected this momentum, with the currency pair trading at 1.2500, up 0.5% on the day. The positive sentiment was largely fueled by growing expectations of potential rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.

As the market digests the implications of the UK budget, the GBP has gained traction against the euro as well, with the EUR/GBP exchange rate slipping to 0.8600, indicating a 0.4% decline. The ongoing rally in Pound Sterling highlights a shift in investor sentiment amid the backdrop of anticipated monetary policy changes, potentially setting the stage for further fluctuations in these key currency pairs in the coming weeks.

Gold (XAU/USD) continues to hover above the $5,000 level, supported by safe-haven demand as investors seek shelter amid uncertain market conditions. The precious metal maintains modest intraday gains, trading comfortably above the key psychological threshold. However, market sentiment remains mixed, with traders cautious despite the solid uptick.

The movement in gold is largely driven by growing expectations of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which is fueling further demand for the metal. As safe-haven flows continue, XAU/USD is benefiting from concerns over global economic uncertainty, yet the lack of strong bullish momentum suggests a wait-and-see approach among traders. The focus remains on upcoming economic data and potential central bank decisions, which could dictate future market direction.

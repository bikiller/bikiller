EUR/USD remained largely unchanged on Thursday, with the exchange rate hovering around 1.1952. The pair struggled to gain momentum as the US Dollar (USD) steadied following a week of significant fluctuations. EUR/USD had earlier touched its highest level in over four years but faced resistance as the Greenback held its ground, limiting the Euro's ability to push higher.

The European Central Bank (ECB) has expressed concerns over the strength of the Euro, which may weigh on future monetary policy decisions. The ongoing strength of the USD, combined with ECB caution, is contributing to the current market indecision. Traders are closely watching for further signals from both central banks that could influence the direction of EUR/USD in the near term.

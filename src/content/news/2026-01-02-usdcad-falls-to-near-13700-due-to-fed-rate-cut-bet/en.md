The USD/CAD currency pair has seen a decline, trading around 1.3710 during the Asian session on Friday. This movement comes as the US Dollar (USD) weakens in response to growing expectations of two additional Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026. The potential easing of monetary policy has pressured the greenback, contributing to the pair's recent losses.

Additionally, rising oil prices have bolstered the Canadian Dollar (CAD), further influencing the exchange rate. As oil remains a crucial export for Canada, higher prices lend strength to the CAD, making the USD/CAD pair's retreat more pronounced. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments, as the interplay between interest rate expectations and commodity prices could significantly impact future movements in this currency pair.

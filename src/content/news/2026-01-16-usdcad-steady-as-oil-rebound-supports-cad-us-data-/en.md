USD/CAD remained steady around the 1.3900 level on Friday, reflecting a balance between a stronger Canadian Dollar and a resilient US Dollar. The Canadian Dollar found support from a rebound in oil prices, which bolstered its appeal as a commodity-linked currency. Meanwhile, the US Dollar maintained its firmness, backed by robust economic data that underpinned market confidence.

As traders assess the implications of these movements, the exchange rate reflects the interplay between commodity influences and economic performance. The stability around 1.3900 suggests a cautious market sentiment, with investors weighing potential future fluctuations in oil and U.S. economic indicators that could impact the currency pair's trajectory in the coming sessions.

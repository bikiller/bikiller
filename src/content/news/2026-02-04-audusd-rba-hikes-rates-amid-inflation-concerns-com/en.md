The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) hiked its cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, maintaining a hawkish stance in response to persistent inflation concerns. This move, while in line with market expectations, signals the central bank's commitment to tackling rising prices. The Australian dollar (AUD) reacted positively to the rate increase, with AUD/USD trading at higher levels as investors adjusted to the tightening monetary policy.

The RBA's decision reflects ongoing worries over inflationary pressures, even as global economic conditions remain uncertain. The Australian dollar's strength against the USD is expected to continue as long as the central bank maintains its aggressive rate hike trajectory. Traders will closely monitor future RBA meetings for any signals regarding further tightening, which could influence the AUD/USD exchange rate in the coming months.

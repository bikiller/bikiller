The AUD/JPY currency pair faces selling pressure around 106.55 during the early European session on Monday, as the Japanese Yen strengthens against the Australian Dollar. The strengthening comes amid growing concerns over potential intervention by Japanese authorities to curb the Yen's decline. This development has led to a brief pullback, but the pair remains supported above its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), maintaining its bullish momentum.

Despite the pullback, the pair continues to show resilience above the 100-day EMA, suggesting that upward pressure may persist. Traders are closely monitoring the situation, with any official action from the Bank of Japan potentially adding further volatility. As of now, the AUD/JPY remains in a positive trend, though risks remain elevated due to intervention threats and broader market sentiment.

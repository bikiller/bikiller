GBP/USD remains under pressure, trading around 1.3685 during the European session on Tuesday. The currency pair continues to face downward momentum, driven by increasing political uncertainty in the UK and growing speculation of imminent rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE). This combination of factors is weighing on the Pound Sterling, which has been unable to hold its ground against the US Dollar.

Political instability in the UK is adding to the pressure on GBP/USD, with traders cautious about potential developments. Meanwhile, the market is pricing in a higher likelihood of BoE rate cuts in the near term, further dampening sentiment toward the British currency. As a result, GBP/USD has fallen below the key 1.3700 level, reflecting the market's growing concerns over economic and political headwinds.

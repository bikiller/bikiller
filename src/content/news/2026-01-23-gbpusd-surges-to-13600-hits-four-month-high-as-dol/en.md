The GBP/USD pair surged to 1.3600 on Friday, reaching its highest point since September 18, 2025. The British Pound continues to outperform the US Dollar as broad-based selling pressure weakens the Greenback. The pair rose by nearly 0.73% on the day, reflecting the ongoing shift in market sentiment.

This rally in GBP/USD is primarily driven by intensified dollar selling, with investors seeking alternative assets amid softer economic data in the US. The pound’s relative strength is further supported by stronger-than-expected UK economic indicators. As the exchange rate breaks key resistance levels, traders will be eyeing potential further gains if the dollar weakness persists.

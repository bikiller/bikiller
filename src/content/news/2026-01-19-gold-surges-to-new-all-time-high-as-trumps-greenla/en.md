Gold (XAU/USD) opened the week with a significant bullish gap, climbing to a new all-time high as safe-haven flows intensify in response to geopolitical tensions. The yellow metal surged, reflecting a robust demand as investors seek refuge amid uncertainty surrounding President Trump’s tariff threats related to Greenland. This movement underscores gold's appeal as a protective asset in turbulent times.

As gold continues to push into uncharted territory, the exchange rate has seen notable volatility, impacting trading strategies across various currency pairs. The recent spike in gold prices not only influences the USD but also affects the broader forex market, as traders reassess risk and adjust their positions in currencies like the EUR and GBP. This dynamic environment highlights the role of geopolitical factors in shaping market sentiment and influencing investor behavior.

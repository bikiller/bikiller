The USD/CAD currency pair has stabilized near the 1.3800 mark during Monday's Asian trading session, reflecting minimal movement after a modest gain in the previous session. This steadiness comes amid rising oil prices driven by supply concerns, which continue to influence the Canadian dollar's performance against the U.S. dollar.

As traders monitor the fluctuating exchange rate, the implications of oil's upward trajectory may put pressure on the USD/CAD pair. A stronger Canadian dollar, fueled by increased oil prices, could lead to a continued consolidation around this critical technical level, impacting future trading strategies and decisions in the forex market.

Reports suggest that Christine Lagarde may step down early as ECB President to allow the appointment of a successor before France's presidential election. This move is seen as a strategy to shield the European Central Bank from potential far-right political influence. Nomura’s Senior European Economist, Andrzej Szczepaniak, views the leadership change as largely neutral in terms of monetary policy.

Market reaction to the possible leadership shift remains subdued, with EUR/USD trading within a tight range around 1.0600.

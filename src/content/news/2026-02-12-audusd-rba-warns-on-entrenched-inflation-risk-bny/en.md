The AUD/USD exchange rate has been under pressure as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) warns of risks tied to persistent inflation. RBA Governor Michele Bullock emphasized that the central bank could implement further rate hikes if inflation expectations and productivity trends remain concerning. This hawkish outlook has added to uncertainty, especially as the Australian dollar faces volatility against the USD.

Geoff Yu, BNY’s EMEA Macro Strategist, highlighted that the RBA's caution stems from the potential for inflation to become entrenched, which could undermine economic stability. With the AUD/USD trading lower, market participants are keeping a close eye on the central bank's next moves and how they may influence the broader forex market. Investors are focused on any signs of further tightening that could strengthen the Australian dollar against major peers like the USD.

TD Securities' FX team, led by Jayati Bharadwaj, sees the US Dollar maintaining tactical strength, supported by safe haven demand amid rising geopolitical risks related to Iran and robust US economic data. The dollar is expected to stay supported against the EUR, AUD, and other currencies with crowded G10 shorts, with the USD likely to maintain its bid tone in the near term.

Despite this short-term strength, TD Securities remains cautious on the USD's long-term outlook, citing a structural decline. As the market digests geopolitical risks and the US economy stabilizes, the broader trend could favor a weaker dollar. In the coming weeks, traders should watch for any shifts in global risk sentiment or changes in US data that might influence USD positioning, particularly against major currencies like EUR and AUD.

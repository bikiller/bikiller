GBP/USD saw a notable uptick during the North American session on Wednesday, with the currency pair rising as the US Dollar (USD) struggled to gain traction amid growing uncertainty over US trade policies. The pair reached a high of 1.2290, driven by a lack of movement in the Greenback, which remained largely flat ahead of key earnings reports from major US megacap companies after the Wall Street close.

The USD's stagnation comes as traders remain cautious, awaiting further clarity on US trade dynamics, which are expected to influence broader market sentiment. While the Euro (EUR) also experienced limited movement, the focus remained squarely on the GBP/USD exchange rate as investors adjusted positions ahead of the corporate earnings results. Any surprises could provide the catalyst for the next move in the currency markets.

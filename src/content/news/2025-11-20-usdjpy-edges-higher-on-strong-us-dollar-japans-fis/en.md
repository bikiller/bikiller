USD/JPY is trading higher on Thursday, currently at 157.20, reflecting a 0.20% increase for the day. The currency pair has gained momentum throughout the week, driven by a robust US Dollar amid ongoing fiscal challenges in Japan. This positive trend underscores the market's preference for USD over JPY, as traders respond to differing economic conditions.

The exchange rate movement highlights the strength of the US economy, which continues to bolster the dollar against the yen. As investors weigh the implications of Japan's fiscal policies, the demand for USD remains strong. The outlook suggests potential further gains for USD/JPY, influenced by macroeconomic factors that favor the US currency in the current trading environment.

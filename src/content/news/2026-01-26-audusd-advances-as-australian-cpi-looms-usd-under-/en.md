AUD/USD is trading at 0.6930, up 0.55% on the day, as the Australian dollar sees early-week gains. The currency pair is holding a positive tone amid anticipation of the upcoming Australian Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. Traders are positioning themselves ahead of the data, which could offer clues about future monetary policy shifts from the Reserve Bank of Australia.

The US dollar is under pressure, with broad weakness in USD across the board. The currency’s decline comes as traders digest economic data and assess the Federal Reserve's next moves. With the market awaiting further economic signals, the AUD/USD exchange rate could continue its upward momentum if Australian CPI comes in stronger than expected, while any surprise in USD strength could reverse the gains.

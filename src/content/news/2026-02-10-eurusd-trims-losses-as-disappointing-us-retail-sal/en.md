EUR/USD trimmed earlier losses on Tuesday, recovering from daily lows as softer-than-expected US Retail Sales data put pressure on the US Dollar. The exchange rate for the EUR/USD currency pair found some relief after the report showed retail sales growth of just 0.2% in January, below the anticipated 0.5%. This disappointing data highlighted a slowdown in consumer spending, weakening the greenback.

As a result, the euro gained modest support, pushing the EUR/USD back from a tight range earlier in the day. The pair briefly tested lows near 1.0750 before climbing back to trade above 1.0780. Traders were also cautious ahead of upcoming economic data, with technical levels indicating potential for further fluctuations. The dollar’s weakness continued to reflect broader concerns over US economic momentum and the Federal Reserve's next moves.

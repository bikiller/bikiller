Gold (XAU/USD) rose by over 0.14% on Tuesday, driven by recent US economic data that intensified speculation about a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve during its December 9-10 meeting. The precious metal traded at $4,141 after dipping to a low of $4,109 earlier in the session, as lower US Treasury yields and a weakening US Dollar bolstered gold's appeal among investors.

The anticipation of a Fed interest rate reduction is fueling further interest in gold, traditionally viewed as a safe haven asset. As the exchange rate dynamics shift with weakening economic indicators, market participants are closely monitoring the developments, which could significantly influence trading strategies in the coming weeks.

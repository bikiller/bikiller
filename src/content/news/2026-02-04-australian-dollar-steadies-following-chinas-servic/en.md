The Australian Dollar (AUD) showed resilience on Wednesday, holding onto gains against the US Dollar (USD) after a robust performance in the previous session. The AUD/USD currency pair steadied around key levels, benefiting from positive market sentiment following China's Services PMI data. The index rose to 52.3 in January, up from 52.0 in December, reflecting solid growth in the sector and providing a lift to the AUD.

The uptick in China's Services PMI helped to reinforce expectations of continued economic recovery, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, which is closely tied to Australia's export market. With the AUD/USD pair trading near crucial support levels, traders will be closely watching upcoming data for further signs of momentum. The movement also highlights the growing influence of China’s economic indicators on Australian Dollar dynamics, as the two economies remain highly interconnected.

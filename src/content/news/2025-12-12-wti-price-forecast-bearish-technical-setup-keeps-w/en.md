West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil prices are struggling to maintain momentum, remaining capped below the $60.00 mark as market participants grapple with ongoing oversupply issues. The persistent concern around excess supply continues to weigh heavily on sentiment, influencing trading decisions across related currency pairs. As the USD remains strong, the WTI outlook appears increasingly bearish.

Market analysts note that this bearish technical setup is likely to keep WTI under pressure, potentially leading to further declines. With the exchange rate dynamics favoring the dollar, traders may find it challenging to see significant upward movement in crude oil prices. The implications for the broader commodities market could be substantial, affecting not only oil-related currencies but also the overall forex landscape.

Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing modest intraday losses during the Asian trading session on Monday, hovering just below the critical $4,050 level. Currently, the precious metal is down 0.50% for the day, reflecting a lack of significant selling pressure, despite a softer USD and prevailing market speculation about potential Federal Reserve rate cuts.

The exchange rate for gold remains resilient, as bulls appear to remain unfazed by the weaker dollar. This suggests that traders are closely monitoring economic indicators and monetary policy developments, which could sway future gold prices. As market participants continue to assess the implications of a changing interest rate environment, gold's performance will likely remain closely tied to fluctuations in USD strength and investor sentiment.

The Japanese Yen strengthened amid rising expectations of a Bank of Japan rate hike. According to MUFG's Derek Halpenny, a sharp surge in super-long Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields in January fueled robust foreign demand. This demand helped stabilize the bond market, easing concerns over market volatility and providing support for the Yen in forex trading.

The shift in JGB yields has had a noticeable impact on the USD/JPY exchange rate, with the pair showing signs of pressure as the Yen gained strength. Traders are now factoring in the possibility of future tightening from the BoJ, which could further boost the Yen’s position against the USD and other major currencies. As the Yen finds support, the outlook for the currency pair remains closely tied to any developments surrounding Japan's monetary policy.

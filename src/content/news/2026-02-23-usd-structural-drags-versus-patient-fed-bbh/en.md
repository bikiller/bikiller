The US Dollar opened the week on a weaker note following a Supreme Court ruling on tariffs, with some immediate pressure seen in USD pairs. Brown Brothers Harriman's Elias Haddad highlighted that while the move is notable, it lacks the strength to trigger a long-term shift in the Dollar’s trajectory. As of the latest trading session, the EUR/USD exchange rate climbed above 1.0950, reflecting the Dollar's tentative softness.

Despite the early weakness, Haddad emphasized that the underlying structure of the US economy and the Federal Reserve's patient stance will likely act as a counterbalance. With markets closely watching for further signals from the Fed, the Dollar remains sensitive to geopolitical and economic news. The USD’s current position suggests that any significant shift in momentum will require more than just short-term market reactions.

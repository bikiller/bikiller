The Japanese Yen (JPY) struggled to maintain its slight intraday gains against the US Dollar (USD) during Friday’s Asian trading session. Despite initial strength, the Yen hovered near a two-week low reached the previous day. The USD/JPY currency pair remains under pressure, trading close to ¥134.40, as market sentiment remains mixed and lacks clear momentum.

Traders are uncertain about the Yen's potential for a more sustained rally, given the overall volatility in the market and the broad strength of the USD. As a result, the exchange rate remains vulnerable to fluctuations, with analysts pointing to the lack of significant catalysts for any sharp movements in the near term. With the EUR/USD trading steady around 1.0650, broader dollar strength continues to weigh on JPY's upside potential.

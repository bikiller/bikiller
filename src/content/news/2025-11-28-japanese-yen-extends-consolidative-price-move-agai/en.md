The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing a mild negative bias against the US Dollar (USD) during Friday's Asian trading session. As the exchange rate stabilizes, the USD shows signs of recovery, but the Yen's downside appears limited, indicating a consolidative price move. Traders are closely watching the 140.00 level for potential shifts in sentiment.

Despite the Yen's struggle against the rebounding USD, broader market dynamics suggest that substantial depreciation is unlikely in the near term. The currency pair remains under pressure, but the JPY is holding steady, reflecting underlying resistance. Market participants continue to assess economic indicators and monetary policy shifts, which could influence future trading directions for the JPY/USD pair.

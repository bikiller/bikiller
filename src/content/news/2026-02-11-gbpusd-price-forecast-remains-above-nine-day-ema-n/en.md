GBP/USD is showing signs of recovery, trading around 1.3680 during European hours on Wednesday. After recent losses, the currency pair has managed to stabilize above the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA) near 1.3650, signaling potential bullish momentum. The pair's movement suggests that buyers are regaining control, with an upward trajectory in focus.

From a technical perspective, GBP/USD continues to trade within an ascending channel pattern, reinforcing a sustained positive outlook. This price action indicates that the pair may maintain its bullish bias, especially if it holds above the key support level of 1.3650. The upward trend is supported by consistent buying pressure despite broader USD strength.

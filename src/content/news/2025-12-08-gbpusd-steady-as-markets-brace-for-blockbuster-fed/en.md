GBP/USD remains steady around 1.3325, positioned just below the key 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of 1.3329. This stability comes as traders anticipate a significant monetary policy decision from the Federal Reserve, which is expected to influence the broader G10 currency landscape. The US Dollar's firmness reflects the cautious sentiment in the market as investors weigh potential shifts in interest rates.

As the Federal Reserve prepares for its upcoming meeting, the exchange rate dynamics are closely linked to expectations of policy adjustments. The outcome could have profound implications for the GBP/USD currency pair, affecting trading strategies and positioning ahead of the Bank of England's own policy decisions. With both central banks in focus over the next two weeks, volatility in the forex markets may increase as traders react to new economic signals.

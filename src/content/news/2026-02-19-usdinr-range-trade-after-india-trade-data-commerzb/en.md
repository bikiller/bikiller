The USD/INR currency pair remains in a range trade following India's January trade data, which revealed a significant widening of the trade deficit to USD 34.7 billion. The surge was primarily driven by a 349% increase in gold imports, spurred by rising global gold prices. This sharp rise in gold demand highlights inflationary pressures and strains on the Indian economy.

The trade data has kept the INR under pressure, with the pair holding steady within a defined range. As the deficit continues to grow, traders are closely watching for potential shifts in the exchange rate, with any further weakness in the INR likely to bring increased volatility. Meanwhile, global economic conditions, particularly in commodity markets, will remain a key influence on the USD/INR trading outlook.

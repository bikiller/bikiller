The GBP/JPY currency pair is experiencing a decline on Tuesday, as political instability in the UK weighs heavily on the British Pound. Trading around 212.00, GBP/JPY is down nearly 0.70% on the day, highlighting market concerns over the country’s uncertain political landscape. Investors are reacting to the latest developments, pushing the exchange rate lower.

Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen remains relatively stable following Japan's recent election, offering a stark contrast to the volatility in the UK. The Yen's post-election stability has provided some support, allowing it to hold its ground against the Pound. This divergence in political environments is influencing traders’ sentiment, leading to the ongoing weakening of GBP/JPY.

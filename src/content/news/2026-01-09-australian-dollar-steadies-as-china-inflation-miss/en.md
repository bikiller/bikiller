The Australian Dollar (AUD) is struggling against the US Dollar (USD), trading lower for the third consecutive session. As of Friday, the AUD/USD pair is under pressure following disappointing inflation data from China, Australia's major trading partner. This development has contributed to a cautious market sentiment, weighing on the exchange rate and limiting any upward momentum for the AUD.

Market analysts are closely monitoring the implications of China's economic indicators, as they could affect demand for Australian exports. With the AUD/USD pair remaining subdued, traders are now looking for potential support levels to gauge whether the currency can stabilize or if further declines are imminent. As the situation unfolds, the focus will remain on the balance between domestic economic performance and external pressures from trading partners.

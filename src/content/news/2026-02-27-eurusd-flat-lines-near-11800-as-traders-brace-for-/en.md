The EUR/USD currency pair is holding steady near the 1.1800 mark as traders await the release of the US Producer Price Index (PPI) data. During the early Asian session on Friday, the pair remained largely unchanged, reflecting a cautious market sentiment. While the Eurozone's softer inflation data provided some support for the euro, the looming uncertainties surrounding US tariffs kept traders on edge.

The exchange rate of EUR/USD is influenced by a balance between Eurozone inflation trends and broader US economic developments. Although weaker inflation in the Eurozone helped stabilize the euro, traders are closely monitoring upcoming economic data from the US. Market participants are positioning themselves ahead of the PPI release, with the expectation that it could impact future Fed policy and affect the broader USD outlook.

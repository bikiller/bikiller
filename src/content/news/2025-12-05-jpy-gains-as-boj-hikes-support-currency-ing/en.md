The Japanese Yen (JPY) is gaining traction in the forex market as expectations mount for a rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Traders are currently pricing in a 25 basis point increase on December 19, which is bolstering confidence in the currency. As a result, the USD/JPY exchange rate is projected to surge to 152 by the end of the year, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

Looking ahead, analysts at ING suggest a more moderate forecast for 2026, estimating the USD/JPY pair will stabilize around 148. This anticipated adjustment underscores Japan's delicate balancing act between economic reflation and maintaining currency strength, which could have significant implications for trading strategies involving both the Yen and the US Dollar.

EUR/JPY is trading at 183.80 on Tuesday, reflecting a 0.20% daily gain. The currency pair is benefiting from Eurozone monetary stability, as the European Central Bank maintains a cautious but steady approach to interest rates. This has supported the Euro against a backdrop of a relatively stable economic environment in the region, boosting EUR demand in forex markets.

Meanwhile, uncertainty surrounding Japan's upcoming election is weighing on the Japanese Yen. Market participants are closely watching political developments, as the outcome could influence future monetary policy. This political risk has created volatility in JPY, contributing to a weaker outlook for the currency. As a result, EUR/JPY is seeing upward pressure, with traders positioning for potential short-term gains in the cross-currency exchange rate.

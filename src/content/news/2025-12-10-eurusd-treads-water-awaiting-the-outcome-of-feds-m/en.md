EUR/USD is currently trading around 1.1630, having retreated from session highs near 1.1660 after a strong performance in the early European session on Wednesday. This pullback highlights a cautious market atmosphere as investors remain on the sidelines, closely monitoring developments ahead of the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision later today.

The anticipation surrounding the Fed's meeting is keeping traders in a wait-and-see mode, significantly influencing the exchange rate of the euro against the dollar. As the market digests potential shifts in monetary policy, fluctuations in the EUR/USD currency pair will likely reflect trader sentiment in response to the Fed's announcements, which could have broader implications for the USD's strength in the near term.

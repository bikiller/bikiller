The EUR/CAD currency pair is currently consolidating around the mid-1.6100s during the early European session on Friday. This stability follows a modest pullback from a three-week high, indicating a pause in the upward momentum observed recently. Traders are closely monitoring this range as they assess potential breakout scenarios.

Market participants are awaiting Canadian jobs data, which could significantly impact the exchange rate. Any surprises in the employment figures may prompt fresh volatility in the EUR/CAD pair, potentially steering it away from its current consolidation phase. As the data release approaches, traders are likely to adjust their positions, leading to heightened trading activity in the forex market.

The USD/CHF currency pair has bounced back to levels near 0.7700 as traders closely monitor the upcoming Federal Reserve monetary policy decision on Wednesday. After a period of decline, the US Dollar is regaining its footing in the forex market, driven by speculation regarding potential interest rate adjustments. 

Market participants are positioning themselves ahead of the Fed's announcement, which could significantly impact the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other major currencies like the EUR. The anticipation surrounding the Fed's decision is likely to create volatility in trading sessions, influencing not just USD/CHF but also broader currency movements as investors seek to gauge the Fed's stance on inflation and economic growth.

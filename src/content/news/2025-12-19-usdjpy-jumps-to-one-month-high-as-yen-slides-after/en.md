The USD/JPY currency pair surged to a one-month high on Friday, trading at approximately 157.48, marking an increase of nearly 1.20%. This sharp rise was driven by a significant depreciation of the Japanese Yen, which fell against multiple currencies following the Bank of Japan's recent interest rate decision. 

The yen's decline reflects a broader trend in market sentiment, as traders react to shifts in monetary policy. With USD/JPY now at its highest level since November 21, the implications for future trading sessions could be substantial, potentially setting the stage for further volatility in the exchange rate as market participants adjust their positions.

GBP/USD experienced a pullback on Tuesday following a strong rebound from the 1.3510 low on Monday. The currency pair closed at 1.3641, marking a 0.39% drop on the session. The initial bounce had sparked optimism for a potential bullish trend, but the retreat suggests market hesitation around the 1.3640-1.3650 zone. 

The pullback in GBP/USD is largely attributed to profit-taking and caution amid a broader USD strength. With the exchange rate testing key support levels, traders are now eyeing the 1.3600 area for potential signs of further weakness. A sustained move below this level could signal a deeper correction, while a recovery above 1.3650 might reignite bullish momentum.

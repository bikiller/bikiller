AUD/USD continues to trade in a narrow range, hovering around 0.6910 during European trading on Tuesday, reflecting a subdued market sentiment for the second consecutive session. The currency pair remains in an ascending channel pattern, which suggests a persistent bullish trend despite current overbought conditions that are keeping upward momentum in check.

As traders analyze the daily chart, the technical indicators point to a resilient bullish bias for AUD/USD. The exchange rate’s stability near the 0.6900 level could indicate a potential consolidation phase or a setup for future gains, especially if the market sentiment shifts favorably towards the Australian dollar against the USD.

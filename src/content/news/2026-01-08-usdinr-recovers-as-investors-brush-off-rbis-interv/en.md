The Indian Rupee (INR) faced downward pressure against the US Dollar (USD) during Thursday's trading session, trading at an exchange rate of around 82.50. This decline followed a notable recovery the previous day, indicating a shift in market sentiment as investors reacted to the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent intervention efforts. 

Despite the RBI's attempts to stabilize the INR, market participants appeared to brush off these measures, leading to a potential reassessment of the currency pair's trajectory. The continued strength of the USD amid global economic uncertainties further complicates the outlook for the rupee, as traders weigh the implications of higher interest rates and inflation concerns. As the session progresses, analysts will closely monitor key resistance levels for the INR amid ongoing volatility in forex markets.

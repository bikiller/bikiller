The USD/CAD exchange rate remained steady near the 1.3650 level on Wednesday, holding ground after modest losses in the previous session. The currency pair traded around 1.3640 during the Asian session, reflecting a limited movement despite the fluctuations in oil prices. The Canadian dollar, traditionally sensitive to crude oil, showed resilience as oil prices continued their decline, adding pressure to the loonie.

While the pair held near its current levels, market participants are closely monitoring any further developments in the oil market, as a sustained drop could weigh on the CAD. With the USD maintaining its strength, the exchange rate is likely to hover within the 1.3600-1.3700 range unless a significant shift in external factors occurs. Traders are also eyeing potential signals from U.S. economic data and central bank commentary for direction.

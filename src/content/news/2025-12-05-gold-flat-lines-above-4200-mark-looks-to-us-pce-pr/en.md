Gold (XAU/USD) remains steady above the $4,200 mark as it attempts to maintain gains following a bounce from the $4,175 level, which aligns with this week's lows. During the Asian trading session on Friday, the precious metal is exhibiting limited movement, trapped in a narrow range as traders await critical economic data.

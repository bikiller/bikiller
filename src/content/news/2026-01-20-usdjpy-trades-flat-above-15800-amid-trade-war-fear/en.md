The USD/JPY currency pair is trading flat above the 158.00 level, currently holding steady around 158.15 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. This stability comes amid ongoing trade war fears that are fueling safe-haven flows, providing support for the yen against the dollar. Market participants are closely monitoring political developments, particularly as speculation rises regarding Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi potentially calling a snap election.

Traders are also looking ahead to the ADP weekly employment report, set to be released later on Tuesday, which could provide fresh momentum for the market. This report is expected to shed light on the U.S. labor market, influencing the USD's performance against other major currencies, including the EUR and JPY. As geopolitical tensions persist, fluctuations in the exchange rate will likely continue to reflect the broader economic landscape.

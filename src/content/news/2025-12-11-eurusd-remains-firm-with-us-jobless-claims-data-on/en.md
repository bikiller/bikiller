EUR/USD has shown resilience in the forex market, currently trading at approximately 1.1720, marking its highest level in almost two months. The currency pair has bounced back from previous losses, gaining nearly 0.8% over the past two days. This upward movement reflects growing investor confidence ahead of the impending US Jobless Claims data.

As traders assess the potential impact of the jobless claims on the USD, the exchange rate remains under close scrutiny. A strong performance in employment figures could amplify volatility, influencing the EUR/USD trading strategy moving forward. The current technical level suggests a bullish sentiment, but market participants will be keen to see how the data releases affect the dollar's strength in the coming sessions.

The EUR/USD exchange rate weakened during the North American session, dropping by more than 0.10% as the US dollar regained strength following Tuesday’s losses. Solid business activity data from the US provided support for the greenback, with stronger-than-expected services sector figures fueling the Dollar's recovery. 

Meanwhile, softer inflation data from the Eurozone added to the bearish sentiment for the euro, further pressuring the EUR/USD pair. The combination of US economic resilience and muted price pressures in the Eurozone has shifted the market’s focus, weighing on the euro's momentum. This movement signals potential volatility for the currency pair in the coming days.

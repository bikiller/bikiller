The Russian ruble (RUB) is expected to face downward pressure against the U.S. dollar (USD) following the Russian central bank's (CBR) recent decision to cut rates by 50 basis points. Despite the cut, CBR has raised its inflation forecast for 2026, signaling a less aggressive stance on monetary tightening. This dovish policy approach is contributing to an environment of weaker market flows, which could push the USD/RUB exchange rate higher.

With expectations for significantly lower average rates by 2027, the market sentiment remains bearish for the ruble. Commerzbank’s Tatha Ghose highlights that the central bank's stance will likely keep the USD in a dominant position against the RUB, with trading likely to favor the dollar in the near term. This development could result in continued volatility for the ruble as traders adjust their positions based on the evolving economic outlook.

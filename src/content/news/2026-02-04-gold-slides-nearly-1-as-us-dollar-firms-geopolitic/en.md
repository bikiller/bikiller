Gold prices fell over 1% during the North American session on Wednesday, retreating from a three-day high of $5,091 to around $4,901. The decline came amid a slight uptick in the US Dollar, which strengthened following mixed market sentiment. This shift weighed on XAU/USD, keeping the precious metal under pressure.

Geopolitical tensions appeared to ease, contributing to the subdued market mood. As the US Dollar firmed, it limited the appeal of gold, traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset. With the current trading around $4,901, the outlook for gold remains uncertain as market dynamics and currency movements continue to influence its price action.

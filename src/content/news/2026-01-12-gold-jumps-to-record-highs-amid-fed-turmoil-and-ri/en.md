Gold (XAU/USD) has kicked off the week with impressive gains, climbing to record highs near the psychological level of $4,600. Currently trading around $4,583, the precious metal has surged nearly 1.70% on the day. This rally is primarily driven by growing concerns regarding the Federal Reserve's independence, leading to heightened risk aversion in the markets.

As investors flee to safety amidst rising geopolitical risks, demand for gold continues to rise, impacting the broader trading landscape. The increased appetite for the yellow metal reflects uncertainties surrounding the USD and potential implications for currency pairs like EUR/USD. With gold's upward trajectory, traders will be closely monitoring the Fed's policy decisions and geopolitical developments that could further influence market dynamics.

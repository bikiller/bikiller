EUR/CAD has shown resilience, maintaining its position near the 1.6150 level during European trading hours on Monday. This marks a continuation of gains for the currency pair, now in its second consecutive session of upward movement. The exchange rate reflects the market's response to recent European Union efforts aimed at counteracting potential tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.

The ongoing negotiations and strategies implemented by the EU are contributing to the stability of the euro against the Canadian dollar. As traders monitor the evolving geopolitical landscape, the EUR/CAD pair’s performance could be influenced further by developments related to tariffs and trade policies, potentially impacting the broader market sentiment and exchange rates for both USD and EUR in the coming days.

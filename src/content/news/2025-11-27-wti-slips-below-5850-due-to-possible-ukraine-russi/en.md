West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil slipped below $58.50, trading around $58.30 per barrel during the Asian trading session on Thursday. This decline follows a more than 1% gain in the previous day, reflecting market volatility as traders react to geopolitical developments.

The potential for a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia has influenced market sentiment, leading to cautious trading. As uncertainty looms, the movement in oil prices may also impact the USD/EUR exchange rate, affecting broader currency pair dynamics in the forex market. Investors are closely monitoring these developments for implications on future oil supply and associated currency movements.

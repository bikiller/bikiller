The Euro (EUR) has found support from Germany's fiscal stimulus measures and ongoing diversification flows, according to Rabobank's FX analyst Jane Foley. These factors have bolstered the currency, allowing it to maintain a foothold against the US dollar (USD). However, stronger growth forecasts for the US and resilient consumer spending may limit the potential for a significant rally in the EUR/USD currency pair.

Trading dynamics suggest that the EUR/USD exchange rate could remain range-bound throughout 2026. While the Euro has gained traction from Germany's economic policies, the persistent strength of the USD continues to challenge its upward momentum. Market participants should watch for technical levels in the currency pair that could signal shifts in trading sentiment as the year progresses.

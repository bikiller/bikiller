The Canadian Dollar (CAD) has continued its decline this week, dropping further into the upper 1.38 range against the US Dollar (USD), according to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret. This downward trend is largely attributed to a robust rebound in the USD, which has strengthened across the board, impacting various currency pairs.

As the CAD wavers, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics, particularly in relation to the USD. This movement not only reflects the CAD's vulnerability but also raises questions about the prospects for the Canadian economy amid a strengthening USD. Market participants will likely be analyzing the potential implications of these shifts in trading strategies moving forward.

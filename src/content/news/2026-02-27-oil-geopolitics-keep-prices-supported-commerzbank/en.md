Oil prices remain supported by ongoing geopolitical factors, with Commerzbank’s Carsten Fritsch projecting only a modest production increase from OPEC+ starting in April. Fritsch notes that both Russia and Kazakhstan are likely to underperform in their output, limiting the impact of any quota hike. This restrained approach will likely prevent significant downward pressure on crude prices, maintaining a balance in the market.

As oil prices continue to hover near key levels, currency pairs such as USD/JPY and EUR/USD are reflecting the broader market sentiment. The oil price stability may weigh on the USD, particularly against the euro, as traders digest the implications of limited supply increases. This scenario presents a mixed outlook for trading, as oil prices play a crucial role in global exchange rate dynamics.

Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a bullish trend at the opening of the first full trading week of 2026, currently trading around $4,448, representing a nearly 2.70% increase on the day. This uptick is primarily driven by escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela, which have spurred a renewed demand for safe-haven assets.

The weak ISM Manufacturing PMI data has further bolstered gold's appeal as traders seek refuge amidst geopolitical uncertainties. As investors closely monitor the evolving situation, the increased safe-haven demand may continue to influence the gold market, potentially altering the dynamics of the XAU/USD exchange rate in the coming sessions.

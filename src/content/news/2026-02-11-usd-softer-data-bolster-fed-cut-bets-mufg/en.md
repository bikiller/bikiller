Weaker US retail sales and signs of cooling labor demand have raised doubts over the Federal Reserve's policy trajectory, prompting a shift in market expectations. Fed fund futures now fully price in a rate cut by June 2026, with traders also speculating on additional easing moves. These developments have weighed on the USD, pushing the EUR/USD exchange rate higher as traders adjust their positions. 

As the outlook for US economic growth dims, the likelihood of aggressive tightening from the Fed diminishes. With the shift in market sentiment, the USD faces downward pressure, potentially impacting its performance across major currency pairs. The market now turns its attention to upcoming data releases, which could further influence Fed policy expectations and set the tone for USD trading in the near term.

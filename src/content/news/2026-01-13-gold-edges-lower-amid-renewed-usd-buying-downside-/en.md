Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing downward pressure as it trades below the $4,600 mark ahead of the European session on Tuesday. The renewed buying interest in the US dollar (USD) has contributed to this decline, although the downside appears limited due to a supportive fundamental backdrop. Market participants are closely watching the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which could influence trading sentiment.

As traders navigate the currency pair dynamics, gold's exchange rate remains sensitive to fluctuations in the USD. The impending CPI data could provide further insight into inflation trends, potentially impacting both gold and USD valuation. With the markets poised for reaction, investors are advised to stay alert for any developments that might sway trading strategies in the commodity space.

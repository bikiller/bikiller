Markets opened the week on shaky ground following a startling announcement from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. On Sunday evening, Powell disclosed that the Fed had received grand jury subpoenas, prompting volatility in the forex markets. The uncertainty surrounding the central bank's legal scrutiny has rattled investor confidence, leading to fluctuations in major currency pairs.

As a result, the USD faced downward pressure against the EUR, with the exchange rate dipping to 1.0850. Traders are closely monitoring this development, as it could impact future monetary policy decisions. The heightened legal concerns surrounding the Fed may lead to increased market volatility and influence the USD's trajectory in the coming weeks. Investors are advised to stay alert for further updates that could affect trading strategies and market positioning.

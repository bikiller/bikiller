The AUD/USD currency pair is trading around 0.6640 on Tuesday, reflecting a gain of 0.20% for the day. The upward momentum is largely attributed to the Reserve Bank of Australia's hawkish stance, which has bolstered the Australian dollar against the USD. This sentiment has provided a boost to traders favoring the AUD amid shifting market dynamics.

Market participants are closely monitoring the outlook for the Federal Reserve, particularly regarding potential rate cuts. The prospect of a dovish monetary policy from the Fed adds pressure to the USD, allowing the Australian dollar to maintain its strength. As trading continues, the implications of these central bank strategies on the exchange rate will be crucial for investors navigating the forex landscape.

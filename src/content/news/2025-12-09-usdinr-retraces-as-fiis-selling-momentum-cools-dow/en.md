The Indian Rupee (INR) showed resilience against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the USD/INR currency pair retreating to around 90.20. This movement comes as the momentum of foreign institutional investor (FII) selling in the Indian stock market appears to be cooling, mitigating pressure on the INR.

As FIIs moderated their outflows, the exchange rate gained traction, signaling potential stabilization in the Indian currency. Traders are closely monitoring this shift, as ongoing fluctuations in FII activity could significantly impact the INR's performance in the forex market. With growing investor sentiment, the INR may build on this momentum if the trend continues.

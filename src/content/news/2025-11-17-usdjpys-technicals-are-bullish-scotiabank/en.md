The Japanese Yen (JPY) weakened by 0.2% against the US Dollar (USD), reflecting its position as a mid-tier performer among G10 currencies. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the technical outlook for the USD/JPY currency pair remains bullish, suggesting potential upward movement in future trading sessions.

This softening of the Yen may influence market sentiment, especially as traders assess the implications for monetary policy and economic performance in Japan. The exchange rate dynamics could prompt increased volatility in the forex market, particularly for those engaged in USD and JPY trading strategies.

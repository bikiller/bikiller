Gold prices (XAU/USD) experienced a 1% decline, trading near $4,180 during the European session on Tuesday. The yellow metal faced significant selling pressure after failing to sustain levels above $4,200. This decline comes despite disappointing U.S. ISM manufacturing PMI data for November, which typically would weaken the U.S. Dollar (USD).

The rebound in the USD has weighed heavily on gold, influencing the currency pair dynamics in the forex market. As traders react to the fluctuations in exchange rates, the gold market remains sensitive to external economic indicators, suggesting that gold may experience further volatility if the USD continues to strengthen against other currencies.

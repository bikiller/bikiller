Gold (XAU/USD) is trading modestly higher on Tuesday, reflecting trader reactions to the latest mixed US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. Currently, the precious metal is priced around $4,615, marking an increase of nearly 0.6% and positioning it just below Monday’s record high of approximately $4,630.

The fluctuation in gold prices underscores ongoing volatility in the market, driven by inflationary pressures in the US economy. As traders assess the implications of the CPI data, the exchange rate for gold continues to hover near historic peaks, suggesting a sustained interest in safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. This upward movement in XAU/USD could signal further fluctuations as investors weigh potential shifts in monetary policy.

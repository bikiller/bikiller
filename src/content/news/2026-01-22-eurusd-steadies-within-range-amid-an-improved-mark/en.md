EUR/USD is currently trading just below the 1.1700 level on Thursday, remaining largely unchanged on the daily chart. The currency pair faced resistance after reaching a peak of 1.1770 on Tuesday, with a subsequent pullback halting at 1.1670 on Wednesday. This stabilization comes amid improved market sentiment, which has kept volatility in check.

Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as it navigates this range, with the 1.1700 level acting as a crucial pivot point. The EUR is benefiting from an optimistic outlook in the markets, while the USD remains under pressure. This interplay could influence future movements, especially if economic data releases shift trader sentiment.

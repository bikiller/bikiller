Recent analysis from TD Securities indicates that gold is no longer in an under-owned phase, marking a significant shift in the market. Institutional ETF ownership has surged, as evidenced by the latest 13F filings, which reveal a notable increase in participation. This trend is further supported by a shift in options premia toward ETFs, suggesting greater confidence among investors.

The latest inflows into gold are largely attributed to retail-linked investors and hedge funds, indicating a broader interest in the precious metal amidst fluctuating currency values. As these investors pivot towards gold, the implications for currency pairs like USD/EUR could be significant, influencing exchange rates and overall market dynamics. The renewed appetite for gold may also affect trading strategies as investors seek safe havens in an unpredictable economic landscape.

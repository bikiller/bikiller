Gold (XAU/USD) is currently consolidating just below the all-time high of $4,600, reached the previous day. During the Asian trading session on Tuesday, the precious metal remained steady as investors adopted a cautious approach ahead of the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which could significantly impact market sentiment and trading strategies.

The looming inflation data is particularly crucial for traders, as it may influence the USD exchange rate and overall market volatility. With gold maintaining its position near record levels, market participants are closely monitoring the potential implications of the CPI figures on future monetary policy and interest rates, which are key drivers of demand for safe-haven assets like gold.

The European Central Bank (ECB) opted to keep interest rates unchanged at 2% for the fifth consecutive meeting, signaling a cautious approach to further tightening. This decision comes amid ongoing economic uncertainty in the Eurozone, with inflation pressures remaining in focus. The EUR/USD pair saw little movement immediately following the announcement, trading around 1.0650, as markets had largely priced in the expectation of a steady policy stance.

The ECB's decision reflects its balanced stance between combating inflation and avoiding stifling growth. While the Euro showed slight resilience, the EUR/USD exchange rate remained under pressure, with technical support levels near 1.0600. Traders will now turn their attention to upcoming economic data, particularly any shifts in inflation or economic growth, which could impact future ECB policy decisions and, in turn, the euro's performance against the US dollar.

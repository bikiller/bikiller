USD/CHF maintains its upward momentum, trading around 0.7950 during the Asian session on Monday. The currency pair's gains mark the second consecutive session of appreciation, driven by a strengthening US Dollar (USD). Market sentiment has shifted, with expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December fading, contributing to the USD's resilience against other currencies.

The shift in market dynamics indicates a potential stabilization in the USD, as traders reassess their positions in light of diminishing rate cut probabilities. This development may have broader implications for the forex market, influencing exchange rates across major currency pairs, including the Euro (EUR) and Swiss Franc (CHF). As the USD continues to gather strength, traders will be closely watching any upcoming economic indicators that could further impact Fed policy and, consequently, USD/CHF movements.

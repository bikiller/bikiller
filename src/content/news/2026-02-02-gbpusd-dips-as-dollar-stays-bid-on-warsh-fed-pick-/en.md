GBP/USD dropped 0.17% on Monday as the US Dollar (USD) continued its upward momentum for a second consecutive day. The Dollar’s strength was fueled by expectations surrounding President Biden's nomination of economist Kevin Warsh to the Federal Reserve, adding to the Dollar’s appeal. The currency pair traded at 1.3662, after reaching a daily high of 1.3715.

The continued climb of the USD came amid a broader market shift, with the precious metals sector also under pressure. Gold prices plunged by over $1,000 following a record high near $5,600, intensifying the USD's gains. As a result, GBP/USD struggled to maintain its earlier strength, with traders focusing on upcoming developments in both US monetary policy and global market sentiment.

Germany's preliminary Q4 GDP data will be released at 09:00 GMT, followed by Eurozone flash GDP figures from Eurostat at 10:00 GMT on Friday. Market participants are closely monitoring these reports for indications of economic performance in the region, as the data could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate. A stronger-than-expected GDP reading may support the euro, driving EUR/USD higher, while weaker figures could trigger a decline.

The EUR/USD currency pair is sensitive to economic releases, and any surprise in the GDP numbers could lead to increased volatility. With the exchange rate hovering around key technical levels, traders will likely adjust their positions based on the data. If the reports show resilience in the Eurozone economy, it could strengthen the euro against the USD, potentially pushing EUR/USD towards resistance levels. Conversely, disappointing results could see the pair test lower support zones.

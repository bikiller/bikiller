USD/CAD continues to decline for the third consecutive session, hitting a five-month low of 1.3675 during Asian trading hours on Wednesday. This steep depreciation in the currency pair reflects mounting pressure on the US Dollar (USD), driven largely by growing expectations for two rate cuts by the Federal Reserve (Fed) in 2026. 

As traders adjust their positions in response to these prospects, the exchange rate has shifted significantly, underscoring the dollar's vulnerability in the current market. The outlook for the USD remains uncertain as investors weigh the implications of potential rate cuts against the backdrop of evolving economic conditions, leaving the USD/CAD pair poised for further fluctuations in the coming sessions.

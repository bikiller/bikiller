Gold (XAU/USD) saw a slight dip on Tuesday, trading near $5,175, down 1.20% on the day. The precious metal's decline comes amid a stronger US Dollar (USD), which has dampened demand for gold as an alternative asset. Despite ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties, the USD remains resilient, affecting gold’s appeal in global markets.

The strengthening of the USD against other currencies, such as the EUR, continues to weigh on gold prices. As traders closely monitor geopolitical tensions and potential economic shifts, market sentiment remains cautious. Gold’s movement is likely to remain sensitive to any significant developments in these areas, with fluctuations in the USD continuing to play a central role in shaping its short-term outlook.

EUR/USD is recovering from last week’s sharp decline, buoyed by a renewed risk appetite among investors. Currently trading around 1.1540, the currency pair found support at 1.1490 on Friday, indicating a potential stabilization following recent volatility. The sentiment shift reflects growing optimism about the market amid a relatively calm start to the week.

The positive movement in EUR/USD comes as traders speculate on potential easing measures from the Federal Reserve. This hope for a more accommodative monetary policy has contributed to the pair's rebound, signaling a possible shift in market dynamics. As the exchange rate hovers around these key levels, further developments could influence trading strategies in the days ahead.

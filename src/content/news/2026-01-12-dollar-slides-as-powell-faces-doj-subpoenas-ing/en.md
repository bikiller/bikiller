The US Dollar (USD) faced significant pressure following Fed Chair Jerome Powell's announcement of grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department. This development sparked concerns about the potential threats to the Federal Reserve's independence, leading to a notable sell-off across various markets. The dollar's exchange rate against major currencies, including the Euro (EUR), reflected this volatility as traders adjusted their positions, pushing the USD lower.

As equities and Treasuries also declined, the impact of these legal challenges on market sentiment became clear. The USD's value dropped, influencing currency pairs and prompting shifts in trading strategies among investors. Analysts are now closely monitoring the ramifications of Powell's disclosures on future monetary policy decisions, as increasing uncertainty could further affect the dollar's performance in the coming weeks.

Silver prices remained largely stable on Thursday, with the XAG/USD currency pair trading at $116.51 per troy ounce. This reflects a slight increase of 0.04% from Wednesday's price of $116.47. The market's steadiness suggests a balance between supply and demand, indicating that traders are currently taking a cautious approach amidst broader economic conditions.

The stability in silver prices comes as investors closely monitor fluctuating exchange rates and economic indicators. The relatively unchanged trading levels highlight a pause in volatility, as market participants assess potential shifts in the USD and other currencies. As trading continues, any movement in the precious metals market could signal changes in investor sentiment and risk appetite, particularly against a backdrop of evolving global economic factors.

Gold prices soared to a new all-time high, with XAU/USD reaching approximately $4,675 during the early Asian trading session on Monday. This surge in the precious metal can be attributed to heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly following comments from US President Donald Trump regarding potential tariffs on eight European nations resisting his plan to acquire Greenland. This announcement has contributed to a risk-off sentiment in the market.

As traders react to these developments, the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and EUR are also in focus. The uncertainty surrounding trade relations and potential economic impacts could drive further demand for safe-haven assets like gold. Market participants are closely monitoring how these tariff threats will influence global economic conditions and the behavior of currency pairs in the coming sessions.

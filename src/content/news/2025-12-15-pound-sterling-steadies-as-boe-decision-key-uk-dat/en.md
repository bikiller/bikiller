The Pound Sterling (GBP) opens the Bank of England's monetary policy week with a cautious stance against major currencies. Trading at 1.2300 against the US Dollar (USD) and 1.1500 against the Euro (EUR), the GBP is experiencing muted movements as market participants await the BoE's policy decision. The uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate adjustments is keeping traders on edge.

Key UK economic data releases are also looming, which could further impact the exchange rate. Analysts are closely monitoring the GBP/USD and GBP/EUR pairs as any shift in the BoE's stance or economic indicators could trigger significant market volatility. As the week progresses, the focus will remain on how these developments influence trading strategies and overall market sentiment.

Silver (XAG/USD) is holding steady at the start of the week, trading around $58.40, reflecting a slight increase of 0.1% on Monday. The market is currently in a consolidation phase as traders exercise caution ahead of the Federal Reserve's policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday. This wait-and-see approach is prevalent among investors who are hesitant to make significant moves in the currency pair.

Geopolitical tensions are also influencing market sentiment, adding another layer of uncertainty. As the Fed's decisions can significantly affect the USD's valuation and, consequently, commodity prices, traders are closely monitoring any developments. With silver's exchange rate remaining stable, the upcoming Fed announcement could potentially trigger volatility in the market, impacting both silver and other currency pairs such as EUR/USD.

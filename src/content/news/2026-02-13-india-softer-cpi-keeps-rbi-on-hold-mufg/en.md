India's CPI inflation, based on the 2024 rebased series, rose by 2.8% year-on-year, primarily due to higher food prices. This softer inflationary pressure has led to expectations that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will keep its monetary policy stance unchanged in the near term. The data signals that the RBI is unlikely to tighten rates aggressively, which could influence the Indian Rupee's performance against major currencies like the USD and EUR.

In the forex market, traders are watching the USD/INR and EUR/INR currency pairs closely, as the CPI figures suggest limited immediate pressure on the INR. A stable or cautious RBI response may keep the Indian Rupee trading within its recent range, with support levels for USD/INR holding around 83.50, and resistance at 84.00. Traders will likely adjust their positions based on further economic data, but for now, the market expects subdued volatility in the Rupee.

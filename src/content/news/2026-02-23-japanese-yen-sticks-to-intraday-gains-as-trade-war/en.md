The USD/JPY currency pair is under significant pressure during Monday's Asian session, sticking to notable intraday losses. The exchange rate dipped to the 154.00 mark but managed a slight rebound, currently trading at 154.35. Despite this modest recovery, the pair remains down over 0.45% for the day, reflecting ongoing weakness in the USD.

The yen's strength is largely driven by rising global trade-war fears, which are boosting demand for safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen. As risk sentiment wanes, investors are flocking to the yen, pushing the USD/JPY lower. The pair could face further downward pressure as markets remain cautious amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

Gold (XAU/USD) has pulled back sharply after reaching a fresh monthly high of $5,250 during the Asian session, marking the end of a four-day winning streak. The precious metal's retreat comes as the US dollar strengthens, driven by a mixed outlook from the Federal Reserve. The firm USD has pressured gold prices, leading to a reversal from the earlier highs.

The strength of the USD, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies, has been a key factor in the decline of gold. As traders digest conflicting signals from the Fed regarding future rate hikes, the exchange rate for XAU/USD has struggled to maintain momentum above the $5,250 level. This move reflects broader market uncertainty, with potential implications for both gold and USD trading in the near term.

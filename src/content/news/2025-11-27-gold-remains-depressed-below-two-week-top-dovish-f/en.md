Gold (XAU/USD) continues to exhibit a negative bias during the Asian trading session on Thursday, remaining below the recent peak reached the previous day. Despite touching a nearly two-week high, the precious metal is currently held back, trading around $1,950. The price action reflects a limited downside, influenced by a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, which has weakened the USD.

The exchange rate for gold is showing resilience amid the broader market dynamics, as the dollar's softness provides some support to the yellow metal. Traders are closely monitoring the movements, as the interplay between USD fluctuations and gold prices could signal potential shifts in market sentiment. This scenario highlights ongoing investor caution and a wait-and-see approach as they assess economic indicators and central bank policies.

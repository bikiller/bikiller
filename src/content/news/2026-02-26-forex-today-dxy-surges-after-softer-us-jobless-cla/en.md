The US Dollar strengthened in Thursday trading, with the DXY surging after fresh labor market data signaled resilience. Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending February 21 came in at 212K, beating expectations of 215K, though slightly above the previous 208K reading. Continuing Claims fell to 1.833 million, reinforcing the view that labor conditions remain broadly stable.

The data supported the USD across major currency pairs, pressuring the EUR/USD exchange rate and weighing on other dollar crosses during the session. Traders interpreted the lower-than-expected claims figure as a sign that the US labor market is not deteriorating as quickly as some had feared, reducing immediate pressure on the Federal Reserve to shift policy direction.

In forex trading, signs of labor market stabilization often translate into firmer Treasury yields and a stronger greenback. The decline in Continuing Claims to 1.833 million added to confidence that employment conditions are holding steady, encouraging renewed USD buying. Market participants now look ahead to upcoming economic releases for further confirmation of the broader economic trend.

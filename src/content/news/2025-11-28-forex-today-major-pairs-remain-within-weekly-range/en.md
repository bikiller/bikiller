Major currency pairs remained confined within their weekly ranges on Friday, November 28, as holiday trading led to reduced market activity. The EUR/USD exchange rate hovered around 1.0300, maintaining a narrow trading band, while the GBP/USD pair was steady near 1.2000, reflecting cautious sentiment among traders. The thin liquidity has resulted in minimal volatility, limiting significant price movements.

The USD continued to show resilience, supported by recent economic data, but investor interest waned as many participants took time off for the holiday. The dollar index held firm, indicating stability against a basket of currencies. With the market's focus shifting towards upcoming economic indicators, any breakout from current ranges could signal fresh trading opportunities in the coming sessions.

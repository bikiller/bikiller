The Pound Sterling (GBP) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD), trading near a fresh seven-week high around 1.3400 on Thursday. This strong performance comes in the wake of the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, which has left the USD struggling to gain traction in the forex market. As traders react to the Fed's decision, the GBP/USD pair remains firmly positioned, showcasing resilience amidst shifting monetary policies.

Market analysts are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics as the GBP capitalizes on the Fed's dovish stance. The current trading level reflects both the UK currency's strength and the ongoing challenges faced by the USD. As the GBP/USD pair hovers around this key technical level, traders are evaluating potential implications for future monetary policy direction and the broader economic landscape in both the UK and the US.

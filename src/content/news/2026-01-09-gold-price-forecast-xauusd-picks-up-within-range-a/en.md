Gold (XAU/USD) rebounded on Friday after finding support near the $4,400 level, with sellers encountering resistance at this key technical threshold. The precious metal's recovery was fueled by a moderate risk aversion in the market, lifting prices towards the upper $4,400s as traders eyed a potential break above the $4,500 mark.

As safe-haven assets gain traction amid uncertain market conditions, the gold exchange rate appears poised for further upward movement. A sustained climb beyond $4,500 could attract additional buying interest, signaling a shift in sentiment among investors navigating the forex landscape. The interplay between gold and the USD remains crucial, particularly in the context of fluctuating global economic indicators.

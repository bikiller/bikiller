The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthened against major currencies on Tuesday, buoyed by positive UK economic indicators. The preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for December and labor market statistics for the three months ending in October contributed to the upward momentum, enabling GBP to advance against the USD and EUR. The currency pair GBP/USD saw a notable rise, reflecting growing investor confidence.

As traders eye the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, the exchange rate movements could be influenced by shifting expectations around the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Should the NFP report indicate robust job growth, the USD may regain some ground, affecting GBP's current gains. Market participants remain vigilant, as the interplay between UK economic resilience and US labor market performance could shape trading strategies in the coming days.

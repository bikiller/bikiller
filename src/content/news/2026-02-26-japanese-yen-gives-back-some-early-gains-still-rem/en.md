The Japanese Yen (JPY) gave back some of its earlier gains but remains relatively firm, trading at around 156.00 against the US Dollar (USD) during the European session on Thursday. The Yen was up by 0.2% at this level, showing resilience despite a pullback from its earlier highs.

This strength comes amid market speculation surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish stance, which has contributed to the Yen's ability to hold onto recent gains. Traders are closely watching the central bank's potential moves, with expectations that its policy approach could provide further support for the currency.

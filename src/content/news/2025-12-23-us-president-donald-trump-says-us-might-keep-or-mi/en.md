US President Donald Trump announced on Monday that the United States may either retain or sell oil recently seized off the coast of Venezuela. This statement comes as the market watches closely for developments that could influence oil prices and, in turn, impact various currency pairs, including USD/EUR. The uncertainty surrounding the future of this oil could lead to fluctuations in the exchange rate as traders adjust their positions.

The potential decision to sell the seized oil could inject additional supply into the market, possibly lowering oil prices and affecting the USD’s strength against other currencies. Conversely, if the US opts to retain the oil, it could signal a tighter supply scenario, potentially supporting higher oil prices and a stronger USD. Market participants are keenly monitoring these developments, as any significant shifts could create volatility in forex trading and influence investor sentiment.

Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward momentum, climbing into the $4,100 range as it aims for a weekly high. Having bounced back from a one-and-a-half-week low just below the key psychological level of $4,000, the precious metal has gained positive traction for the second consecutive day. The current exchange rate reflects heightened interest as traders anticipate potential market-moving insights from the upcoming FOMC minutes.

The recent bullish movement in gold prices can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a weaker USD and ongoing economic uncertainty. As investors look for safe-haven assets, gold's appeal increases, particularly in light of fluctuating currency pair dynamics. With the FOMC minutes on the horizon, market participants are closely monitoring any signals regarding future monetary policy, which could further influence gold trading in the coming sessions.

EUR/USD is currently trading at 1.1660, having oscillated between 1.1650 and 1.1675 during the Asian and European market sessions on Monday. This range-bound movement reflects the market's cautious stance as traders await the release of crucial US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data.

The upcoming CPI figures are expected to impact the exchange rate of the EUR/USD currency pair significantly, as inflation data can influence monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. With the USD under scrutiny, market participants remain poised to react to any shifts that could emerge from the CPI report, potentially leading to increased volatility in the forex market.

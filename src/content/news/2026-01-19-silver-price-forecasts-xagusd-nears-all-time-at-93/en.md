Silver (XAG/USD) continues to trade robustly above the $93.00 level, nearing the all-time high of $93.90 reached last week. The surge in prices is largely driven by heightened risk aversion among investors following US President Trump's announcement of additional tariffs on several major European partners. This geopolitical development has created a cautious market atmosphere, influencing the trading dynamics of both the silver and broader currency markets.

As traders react to the evolving situation, the exchange rate of XAG/USD reflects a strong demand for safe-haven assets. The impact of these tariffs on economic relations is likely to keep volatility high, as market participants adjust their strategies in response to ongoing uncertainties. The resilience of silver prices indicates that investors are seeking refuge amidst potential economic upheaval, highlighting the significant interplay between geopolitical events and forex trading trends.

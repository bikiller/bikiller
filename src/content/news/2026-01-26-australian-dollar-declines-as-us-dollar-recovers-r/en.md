The Australian Dollar (AUD) fell against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday after the currency pair opened with a gap up. The AUD/USD exchange rate dropped as the US Dollar regained some strength, boosted by increased demand for safe-haven assets. This shift in sentiment followed comments from US President Donald Trump over the weekend, contributing to a rise in the Greenback.

As the market absorbs these developments, the US Dollar continues to consolidate its recent gains. The AUD/USD pair's decline highlights the ongoing vulnerability of the Australian Dollar amid global uncertainties. Traders will be closely monitoring further geopolitical updates for potential impacts on the USD's safe-haven appeal and the broader forex market.

The GBP/USD currency pair surged during Tuesday’s North American trading session, reaching an exchange rate of 1.3776, a significant increase of 0.76%. The rally was largely driven by the ongoing weakness of the US Dollar, which has been hit hard by escalating trade tariffs. This development comes just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting, scheduled for later this week.

As market participants react to the shifting dynamics in trade policy, the pressure on the Greenback continues to mount. With the potential for adjustments in monetary policy on the horizon, traders are closely monitoring how these factors will shape the USD’s performance against major currencies, including the Pound Sterling. The current momentum in GBP/USD indicates a challenging environment for the Dollar, adding to the uncertainty surrounding future exchange rate movements.

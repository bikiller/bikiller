Silver (XAG/USD) has shown a cautious trading stance, hovering around $80 in the Asian session as the week begins. This marks a slight recovery from the four-week low of $73.33 hit on Friday. Traders are closely monitoring the market ahead of the upcoming US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, with sentiment likely influenced by any changes in US employment data.

The silver market is reacting to broader risk sentiment, with fluctuations in the US dollar (USD) impacting the XAG/USD exchange rate. As the week progresses, silver's near-term support appears to be above $70, with volatility expected to intensify as key data from the US potentially alters market expectations for the Fed's policy stance. Investors are likely to remain cautious, awaiting further developments in the USD and broader risk appetite.

The AUD/JPY currency pair has shown resilience by recovering from a 0.17% dip on Monday, as it rises 0.39% after testing the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 100.45. Currently, the exchange rate stands at 101.26, up 0.05% during Wednesday's Asian trading session. 

Bulls are now eyeing the yearly high as momentum builds, suggesting a potential continuation in upward movement. The fluctuations in the AUD/JPY reflect broader market trends, with traders closely monitoring developments that could influence the Australian dollar against the yen. This recovery could have implications for trading strategies, particularly for those focused on the AUD amid ongoing global economic shifts.

The Japanese yen faced significant losses as traders reacted to shifting market dynamics ahead of the crucial US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. The USD/JPY pair climbed to 130.45, marking a 0.75% increase, while the EUR/JPY also saw upward momentum, trading at 143.60. These movements reflect a broader trend as investors position themselves ahead of the inflation data, which could impact future Federal Reserve monetary policy.

Market participants remain cautious, with the USD gaining strength against major currencies amid expectations that the US CPI might signal continued inflationary pressures. The EUR/USD exchange rate hovered around 1.0850, indicating a slight decline of 0.25% as the euro struggled against a buoyant dollar. The implications of today's data release are critical, as they could steer market sentiment and influence trading strategies in the coming sessions.

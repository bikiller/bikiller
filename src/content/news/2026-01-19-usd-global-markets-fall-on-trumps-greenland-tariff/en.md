Global markets experienced a downturn following President Trump's announcement of a 10% import tariff on several European nations, including Denmark, Sweden, and Germany. The European Stoxx futures fell by 1.3%, while S&P futures dropped 0.9%. This move has raised concerns about escalating trade tensions, prompting traders to reevaluate their positions in various currency pairs.

As a result, the USD gained traction against the EUR and other major currencies, reflecting a growing preference for safe-haven assets amidst market uncertainty. Analysts suggest this tariff threat could impact exchange rates significantly, with the potential for increased volatility in upcoming trading sessions. Investors are closely monitoring developments, as the implications of these tariffs may extend beyond the immediate market response, influencing broader economic sentiments and currency valuations.

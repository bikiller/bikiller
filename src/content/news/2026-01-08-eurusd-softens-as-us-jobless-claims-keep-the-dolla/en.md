The Euro (EUR) has experienced a downturn against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the EUR/USD exchange rate slipping further as the Greenback gains momentum from robust US jobless claims data. The latest figures indicate a stronger labor market, bolstering investor confidence in the USD and driving selling pressure on the Euro.

As the market digests these labor statistics, traders are closely monitoring key technical levels for the EUR/USD currency pair.

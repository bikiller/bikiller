The EUR/JPY currency pair stabilized on Monday after experiencing significant volatility triggered by Japan’s recent election results. Following an initial dip, the exchange rate bounced back from an intraday low of 184.87 to hover around 185.75. The early morning fluctuations reflected investor reactions to the political outcomes, which had initially sent the Yen under pressure.

At the time of writing, EUR/JPY shows signs of recovery, though it remains sensitive to any further developments in Japan’s political landscape. With the pair currently trading near 185.75, the market is keenly watching for any signs of sustained strength or further reversals, especially as market participants assess the broader implications of the election on Japan’s economic and monetary policy outlook.

The USD/INR currency pair showed resilience on Thursday, trading flat around the 90.20 mark after experiencing a noteworthy rebound the previous day. The Indian Rupee's inability to maintain its gains, which were bolstered by intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), reflects ongoing challenges in sustaining upward momentum against the US Dollar.

As market participants analyze the implications of the RBI's actions, the INR's struggle to extend its recent recovery may signal underlying weaknesses. Traders are closely monitoring this exchange rate for potential shifts in sentiment, particularly as broader market factors continue to influence the dynamics of the USD/INR pair.

The New Zealand Dollar (NZD/USD) is currently facing resistance around 0.6050, as traders await the release of the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. The pair has been in a strong uptrend since late November, holding above key technical levels, including the 50 Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 0.5874 and the 200 EMA at 0.5845, reflecting a solid rally from the 0.5580 low.

As the NZD/USD holds its gains, the market is closely watching the US NFP report, which could trigger further volatility for the pair. A stronger-than-expected NFP print may fuel USD demand, potentially capping the NZD’s advance. Conversely, disappointing data could lead to a fresh push higher for the New Zealand Dollar, as traders recalibrate their expectations for US economic strength.

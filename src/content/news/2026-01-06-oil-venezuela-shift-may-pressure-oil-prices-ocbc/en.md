Political shifts in Venezuela may revitalize the country's oil sector, potentially leading to increased production and putting downward pressure on global oil prices. As the market anticipates these changes, traders should monitor the impact on the USD and its correlation with oil prices, especially given Brent's current support amid OPEC’s decision to maintain production quotas.

The exchange rate dynamics will be crucial as oil prices influence the USD/EUR pair, where fluctuations could alter trading strategies. If Venezuelan oil exports rise, it could lead to a stronger dollar relative to the euro, affecting overall market sentiment. Investors should remain vigilant, as these developments may create opportunities or risks in the forex market depending on how oil prices react.

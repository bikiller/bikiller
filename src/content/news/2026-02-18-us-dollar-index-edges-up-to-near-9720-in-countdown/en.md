The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the Greenback against a basket of six major currencies, is trading slightly higher, rising by 0.1% to approach the 97.20 mark during early European trading on Wednesday. The index has been gaining ground ahead of the upcoming release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, as traders adjust their positions.

This uptick in the DXY comes as market participants await insights into the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy. The dollar's movement is closely linked to expectations regarding the central bank's stance on interest rates, particularly after recent volatility in key currency pairs like USD/EUR. With the FOMC Minutes likely to shed light on economic projections and policy considerations, market sentiment remains cautious yet anticipatory.

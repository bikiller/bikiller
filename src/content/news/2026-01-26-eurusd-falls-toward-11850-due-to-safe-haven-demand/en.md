The EUR/USD currency pair is currently experiencing a decline, trading around 1.1860 after opening with a gap up. The downward movement is attributed to increased safe-haven demand as traders seek stability amid global uncertainties. This shift in sentiment has prompted the exchange rate to fall toward the key level of 1.1850 during the Asian trading session on Monday.

Market participants are closely watching for the release of Germany’s IFO Business Sentiment Index later today, which could further influence the euro's trajectory against the U.S. dollar. Any unexpected results may lead to increased volatility in the forex market as traders adjust their positions based on potential changes in economic outlook.

The USD/CAD currency pair is holding near two-week highs as the US Dollar shows resilience, trading at 1.3650. This firm performance comes despite increasing market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, which typically weigh on the Greenback. The exchange rate reflects a broader trend of the US Dollar maintaining its strength amid concerns around the Canadian economy.

As traders position themselves in anticipation of potential shifts in Fed policy, the Canadian Dollar is trading under pressure. The rising speculation around rate cuts could signal a shift in economic outlook, impacting the CAD's performance against the USD. The current market dynamics underscore the delicate balance between interest rate expectations and currency valuation, with implications for future trading strategies.

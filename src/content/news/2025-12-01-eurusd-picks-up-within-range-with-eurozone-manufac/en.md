EUR/USD is currently trading with moderate gains, hovering just above the 1.1600 mark. As of now, the exchange rate is experiencing upward pressure, although attempts to push beyond the 1.1615 resistance level have been limited. Traders are closely monitoring the movements in this major currency pair, with a cautious eye on upcoming Eurozone manufacturing data that could influence market sentiment.

The potential impact of the forthcoming manufacturing figures could provide direction for the EUR/USD exchange rate. A stronger performance in Eurozone manufacturing may bolster the euro against the USD, while weaker data could reinforce the dollar's strength. As the market prepares for this pivotal economic release, fluctuations in the currency pair are expected to continue, reflecting traders' assessments of the Eurozone's economic health.

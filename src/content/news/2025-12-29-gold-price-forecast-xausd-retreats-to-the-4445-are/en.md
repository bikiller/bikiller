Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a notable decline on Monday, retreating approximately $80 from last week's record high of $4,550 to session lows around $4,445. The drop was influenced by rising optimism regarding a potential peace deal in Ukraine and a moderate recovery in the US Dollar, resulting in thinner trading volumes typical of year-end markets.

The sharp pullback in precious metals reflects broader market sentiment, as traders adjusted positions amid fluctuating geopolitical news and a stronger USD. This movement in the XAU/USD currency pair underscores the impact of external factors on gold prices, highlighting the delicate balance between safe-haven demand and currency fluctuations in the forex market.

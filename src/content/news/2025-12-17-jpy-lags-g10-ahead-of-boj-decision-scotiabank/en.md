The Japanese Yen (JPY) is underperforming among G10 currencies as traders anticipate the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) upcoming policy decision. Despite strong domestic economic indicators, the focus has shifted towards positioning ahead of Friday's meeting, where a rate hike and a more hawkish stance are expected. This outlook is contributing to the JPY's weakness against major peers.

As markets prepare for potential changes in monetary policy, the exchange rate dynamics are shifting. Currency pairs involving the JPY may see increased volatility, particularly against the USD and EUR. Traders are closely monitoring technical levels, as any shift in BoJ policy could have significant implications for JPY valuation and overall market sentiment in the coming days.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) has continued its downward trend against the US Dollar (USD), marking its third consecutive day of losses. During the European trading session on Thursday, the currency pair hovered around an exchange rate of 1.3450, reflecting concerns over the UK’s economic outlook and market sentiment ahead of the upcoming US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report.

Investors are closely watching the NFP data, which is expected to provide insights into the health of the US labor market and could influence future Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. As the GBP/USD pair struggles to maintain its footing, analysts suggest that further declines may be on the horizon if the NFP report exceeds expectations, potentially strengthening the USD and putting additional pressure on the Pound.

EUR/USD continues to struggle, trading at 1.1635 on Thursday, just above one-month lows of 1.1618. Despite positive Eurozone Industrial Production data, which exceeded expectations, the currency pair remains under pressure, reflecting broader market sentiment and concerns surrounding the USD.

As traders await key US manufacturing data and remarks from Federal Reserve officials, the exchange rate is likely to remain volatile. Any signs of strength in the USD or hawkish signals from the Fed could push EUR/USD further down, potentially testing the recent lows. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments for cues on future trading strategies.

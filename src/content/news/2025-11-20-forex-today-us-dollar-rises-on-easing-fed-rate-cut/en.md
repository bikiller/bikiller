The US Dollar strengthened on Thursday, November 20, as market participants adjusted their expectations regarding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. The greenback surged against several currencies, with the EUR/USD trading at 1.0930, reflecting a 0.68% decline for the Euro. This shift in sentiment comes as traders prepare for the upcoming Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, which could further influence the USD's trajectory.

In the currency markets, the USD/JPY pair rose to 142.50, an increase of 0.45%, as investors sought safe-haven assets amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. The focus on economic data continues to dominate trading, with analysts predicting that stronger employment figures could bolster the dollar’s momentum. As the market anticipates the NFP release, volatility is expected to rise, impacting exchange rates across major currency pairs.

EUR/USD continues to face downward pressure as it trades lower for the third consecutive day, now at 1.1725. The currency pair was rejected at the key resistance level of 1.1750, indicating a bearish sentiment in the market ahead of the European Central Bank's monetary policy decision. Despite this decline, the exchange rate remains above the psychological level of 1.1700, keeping it within the broader weekly range.

Market participants are closely monitoring the ECB's upcoming announcement, which could significantly influence the euro's strength against the dollar. The current trading pattern suggests that traders are cautious, reflecting uncertainties in the economic outlook. As the exchange rate fluctuates, both USD and EUR investors are bracing for potential volatility, with implications for future trading strategies and positioning in the forex market.

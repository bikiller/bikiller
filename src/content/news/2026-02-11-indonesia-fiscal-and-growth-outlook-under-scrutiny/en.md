Indonesia enters 2026 with solid growth momentum, but concerns over fiscal risks and policy uncertainty are beginning to surface. According to MUFG’s Senior Currency Analyst Lloyd Chan, the country’s economic outlook remains favorable, supported by strong domestic demand and export growth. However, the government faces mounting pressures to address rising fiscal deficits, which could weigh on investor sentiment and the stability of the IDR (Indonesian Rupiah) in the forex market.

As Indonesia's fiscal outlook remains under scrutiny, the IDR may face volatility against major currencies such as the USD and EUR. The Rupiah's exchange rate has been sensitive to global market shifts, particularly fluctuations in the USD/IDR currency pair. MUFG analysts caution that while growth remains resilient, further policy tightening or unaddressed fiscal imbalances could lead to significant market corrections, impacting trading strategies for forex investors.

GBP/JPY dropped sharply during the North American session, losing over 0.61% as the Japanese Yen (JPY) strengthened on growing expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will hike interest rates at least twice this year. This shift in market sentiment weighed on the GBP/JPY exchange rate, which has seen increased volatility as traders adjust to the BoJ's hawkish outlook.

The Yen's rally is driven by speculation that Japan's central bank will move towards tighter monetary policy, a notable contrast to its prolonged dovish stance. As the GBP/JPY pair slides, traders are closely watching key technical levels. The current retreat could push the pair toward further downside, especially if BoJ signals additional rate hikes in upcoming statements. The market’s response to this shift remains a critical factor for short-term trading strategies.

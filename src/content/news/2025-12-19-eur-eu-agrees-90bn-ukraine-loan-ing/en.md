EU leaders have successfully secured a €90 billion loan package for Ukraine, which is seen as a favorable outcome for the Euro (EUR) in the currency markets. Following this news, the EUR/USD exchange rate is hovering near support levels around 1.1680, indicating a potential for range trading in the near term. Analysts suggest that this development may bolster the Euro as traders adjust their positions.

As the market digests the implications of the loan, the focus remains on the EUR/USD currency pair, with the exchange rate experiencing fluctuations within established ranges. ING's FX analyst Chris Turner notes that while upward momentum may be limited, the positive sentiment surrounding the EU's financial support for Ukraine could provide a foundation for the Euro's stability against the USD. Traders are likely to keep a close eye on technical indicators as they navigate this evolving landscape.

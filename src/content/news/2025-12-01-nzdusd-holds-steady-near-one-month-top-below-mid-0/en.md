The NZD/USD currency pair is trading in a narrow range, maintaining its recent gains just below the mid-0.5700s as the week begins. After reaching a peak not seen in nearly a month on Friday, the exchange rate is showing resilience despite disappointing Chinese economic data that typically influences market sentiment.

As traders assess the implications of the weaker data from China, the New Zealand dollar remains steady, reflecting a cautious optimism in the face of external pressures. The NZD/USD pair's ability to hold near these levels suggests a consolidation phase, which could set the stage for future movements depending on broader economic developments and fluctuations in risk appetite.

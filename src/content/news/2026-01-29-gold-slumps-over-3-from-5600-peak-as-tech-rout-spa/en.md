Gold (XAU/USD) dropped over 3% on Thursday, retreating from a record high near $5,600 to trade at $5,266. The sharp decline came as a result of profit-taking, following a broader market slump. A lack of fresh catalysts, combined with a retreat in copper prices and significant losses in six of the top seven Mag 7 tech stocks, triggered the sell-off in the precious metal.

This pullback in gold also reflected weakness in other commodities, including silver, which followed a similar downward trend. With the USD showing strength against other currencies like EUR, market participants opted to secure profits, leading to the drop in the XAU/USD exchange rate. Traders are closely watching for any new developments that could impact the outlook for gold in the coming sessions.

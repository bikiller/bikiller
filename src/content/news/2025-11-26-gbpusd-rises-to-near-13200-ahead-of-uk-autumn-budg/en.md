GBP/USD has extended its rally for the fifth consecutive day, hovering near the 1.3200 mark and currently trading around 1.3190 during the Asian session on Wednesday. Market participants are closely monitoring developments as UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, prepares to unveil the Autumn Budget later today. 

The anticipation surrounding the budget announcement is contributing to the currency pair's upward momentum, as traders speculate on potential fiscal measures that could influence the UK's economic outlook and, consequently, the exchange rate. A positive response to the budget could further bolster the pound against the USD, while a lackluster outcome may reverse recent gains.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing downward pressure against safe-haven currencies as geopolitical tensions rise following US raids on Venezuela. As traders react to the news, GBP/USD has shifted to the downside, trading around 1.2300, reflecting a broader market aversion to risk. This environment has favored currencies like the Swiss Franc (CHF) and Japanese Yen (JPY), which have seen gains against the pound.

In contrast, GBP remains relatively stable against riskier currencies such as the Euro (EUR), with the GBP/EUR exchange rate hovering near 1.1600. The market's focus on safe assets underscores a cautious sentiment that could continue to influence trading strategies in the coming days. As uncertainties persist, traders are advised to monitor developments closely, as further volatility may impact currency pairs involving the GBP.

EUR/JPY has shown minimal movement after two consecutive days of gains, trading around the exchange rate of 180.20. This position is close to its recent all-time high of 180.29, indicating strong upward momentum in the currency pair during early European trading on Wednesday.

The stability at these elevated levels suggests sustained investor interest, likely driven by favorable economic indicators from the Eurozone and ongoing market speculation surrounding the USD's strength. As traders closely monitor these developments, the implications for the EUR/JPY exchange rate remain significant, potentially signaling further upward movement if momentum continues.

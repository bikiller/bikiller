The USD/INR currency pair opened flat on Friday, continuing to hover near its over three-week low. The Indian Rupee (INR) remained under pressure, trading close to the 91.20 mark against the US Dollar (USD). This consolidation follows a lack of foreign inflows into Indian equities, which has left the INR vulnerable to external market conditions.

Despite attempts at stability, the INR struggles amid a slow pace of foreign investment into the Indian stock market. The USD/INR pair's technical level at 91.20 is a crucial point for traders, with a lack of positive catalysts weighing on the Rupee's performance. The ongoing trend reflects broader concerns about India's attractiveness to global investors.

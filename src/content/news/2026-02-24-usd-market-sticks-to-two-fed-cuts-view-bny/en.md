The US Dollar remains under pressure as market participants continue to price in two Federal Reserve rate cuts this year, despite recent hawkish signals from the central bank. According to BNY's John Velis, interest rate markets, a significant influence on USD movement, are factoring in these cuts, even as PCE inflation stays sticky and GDP growth weakens. The EUR/USD exchange rate remains resilient, holding above key support levels as traders await further guidance.

The outlook for USD trading appears increasingly uncertain as the Fed's minutes indicate a more hawkish stance, yet markets have not adjusted significantly. The divergence between the central bank's policy outlook and market expectations could lead to further volatility in the USD, with the EUR/USD pairing potentially eyeing resistance near 1.1000. This disparity is likely to influence short-term market sentiment and could impact other major currency pairs in the coming weeks.

The Chinese Ministry of Commerce reiterated its commitment to advancing the trade agreement with the U.S. during European trading hours on Wednesday. The ministry emphasized that China has met its obligations under the first phase of the deal, signaling potential stability for the global markets. This announcement came as the USD/CNY pair remained steady, with the yuan holding firm against the dollar, reflecting market optimism.

The USD remained under pressure following the news, with the EUR/USD pair seeing modest gains during the European session. The exchange rate briefly surged to 1.0850, supported by the positive sentiment surrounding the trade discussions. Investors are closely watching developments, as any progress could have significant implications for broader market sentiment, especially with key technical levels such as 1.0900 in focus for the euro.

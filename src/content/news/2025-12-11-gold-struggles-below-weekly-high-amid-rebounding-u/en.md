Gold (XAU/USD) struggled to maintain momentum below the weekly high reached earlier in the day, holding steady around the critical level of $4,200 as the European session approached. The precious metal's offered tone reflected the rebound in the US Dollar (USD), which halted its decline following the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) recent decisions.

The USD has shown signs of recovery from its lowest exchange rate since October 24, impacting gold's trading dynamics. As the dollar strengthens, traders are closely monitoring potential implications for other currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, which could experience volatility in response to shifts in investor sentiment and the Fed's dovish stance.

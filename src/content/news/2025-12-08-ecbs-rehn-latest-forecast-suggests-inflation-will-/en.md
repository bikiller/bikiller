In a recent interview with Milano Finanza, European Central Bank policymaker Olli Rehn indicated that the latest forecasts show inflation in the Eurozone is expected to remain slightly below the 2% target in the coming period. This outlook may influence trading behaviors in the EUR/USD currency pair, as market participants assess the implications for monetary policy and interest rates.

As traders digest Rehn's comments, the euro's exchange rate could face fluctuations against the USD. A stable inflation forecast may reinforce the ECB's current stance, potentially limiting aggressive rate hikes. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as any deviation from the expected inflation trajectory could impact market sentiment and lead to volatility in the forex markets.

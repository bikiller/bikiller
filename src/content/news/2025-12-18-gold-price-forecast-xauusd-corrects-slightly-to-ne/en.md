Gold prices (XAU/USD) dipped 0.4% during Thursday's European trading session, settling near $4,320 as traders positioned themselves ahead of upcoming U.S. inflation data. This slight correction comes as market participants remain attentive to shifts in the economic landscape, which could influence central bank policies and, consequently, the exchange rate dynamics of the USD.

Despite this pullback, gold remains just below its all-time high of $4,381, reflecting ongoing investor demand and geopolitical uncertainties. As inflation figures are anticipated, the market will closely monitor their impact on both gold prices and broader currency pair movements, particularly against the USD and EUR. The interplay between these factors could set the tone for future trading sessions in the precious metals market.

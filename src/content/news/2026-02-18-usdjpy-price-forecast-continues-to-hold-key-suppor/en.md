The USD/JPY currency pair is trading 0.27% higher at approximately 153.70 during the European session on Wednesday. This movement follows a period of consolidation near the key support level of 152.00, where the exchange rate has found stability. Market participants are closely monitoring the pair's ability to maintain this level, as a break below could signal further weakness.

The current bullish momentum in USD/JPY appears driven by a combination of factors, including ongoing dollar strength and investor sentiment surrounding global economic conditions. With the exchange rate hovering near 153.70, the pair is facing immediate resistance, and any sustained movement above this point could open the door to higher levels. Traders will be keen on any developments that may shift the pair’s direction, particularly as the U.S. economy remains a focal point for forex markets.

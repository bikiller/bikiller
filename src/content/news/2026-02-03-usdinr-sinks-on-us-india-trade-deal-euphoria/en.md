The Indian Rupee (INR) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday following the announcement of a long-awaited trade deal between the US and India. The USD/INR currency pair opened with a gap down, reaching a near three-week low of 90.35. This positive momentum in the INR was driven by investor optimism surrounding the new trade agreement, which is expected to boost economic ties between the two countries.

As the INR gains strength, traders are closely watching for further developments in the US-India relationship and their potential impact on the exchange rate. A continuation of the current trend could see the USD/INR pair testing lower support levels, adding pressure on the US Dollar. Investors are likely to monitor the broader market for any additional signals from both economies that could influence the currency pair in the coming weeks.

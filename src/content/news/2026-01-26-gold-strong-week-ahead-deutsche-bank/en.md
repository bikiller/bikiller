Gold prices have surged by 8.52% in recent trading, approaching the $5,000 mark, according to Deutsche Bank's Reid Macro Strategy report. This sharp increase is primarily attributed to growing geopolitical tensions, which have sparked a flight to safe-haven assets like gold. The rise is noteworthy as the precious metal nears this psychological price level, intensifying market focus.

As traders monitor global political developments, gold's ascent continues to impact broader forex markets. The USD's strength has remained resilient despite gold's rally, which highlights a complex dynamic between risk-off sentiment and dollar performance. With geopolitical risks intensifying, gold’s bullish momentum may signal further volatility for major currency pairs, including USD/EUR and USD/JPY, in the days ahead.

Gold (XAU/USD) surged over 1% during the North American session on Friday, reaching a fresh all-time high of $4,988. The rally was fueled by a sharp decline in the US Dollar (USD) amid growing speculation that Japan could intervene to support the Japanese Yen (JPY). The intervention rumors sparked volatility in the FX markets, contributing to a boost in risk appetite.

As USD weakness drove the surge in gold prices, traders eyed potential actions from Japan to stabilize the Yen. The move propelled gold to new highs, with the yellow metal benefiting from a favorable market environment and rising demand for safe-haven assets. The improvement in risk sentiment led to a dynamic shift, influencing exchange rates and amplifying movements across major currency pairs.

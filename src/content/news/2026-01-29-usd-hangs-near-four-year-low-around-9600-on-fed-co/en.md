The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback against a basket of currencies, is currently hovering around 96.00, nearing a four-year low. During the Asian trading session on Thursday, the index faced renewed selling pressure, leading to a setback that partially reversed Wednesday's modest recovery. Concerns surrounding the Federal Reserve's policy direction and broader economic risks continue to weigh heavily on the USD's performance.

Market participants are closely watching the USD's exchange rate against major pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, as fluctuations in the dollar's value could influence trading strategies. The ongoing uncertainty regarding monetary policy and economic growth is likely to keep the DXY under pressure, prompting traders to reassess their positions in light of potential shifts in market sentiment.

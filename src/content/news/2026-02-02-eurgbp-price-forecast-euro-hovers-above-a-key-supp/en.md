The EUR/GBP currency pair is experiencing a modest upside bias on Monday, trading around 0.8665, though it remains constrained by its broader bearish trend. The Euro is struggling to maintain momentum against the British Pound despite a slight recovery, hovering just above a critical support level at 0.8645.

While the pair faces resistance, it is unable to break free from the support area, indicating continued bearish pressure in the market. Traders are likely waiting for clearer signs of direction, with the support zone at 0.8645 crucial for future movements. A sustained break below this level could lead to further losses for the Euro against the Pound.

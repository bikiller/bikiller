The Indian Rupee (INR) opened the week on a weaker note against the US Dollar (USD), reflecting ongoing foreign outflows from the Indian market. As USD/INR trades lower, this downward pressure is attributed to the recent decision by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to implement a rate cut, impacting investor sentiment and the currency's exchange rate.

With the USD showing strength amid global economic uncertainties, the INR is facing challenges in maintaining stability. The current trading environment suggests that the exchange rate for the USD/INR pair could continue to fluctuate as foreign investment trends evolve and market participants respond to the RBI's monetary policy changes. This situation warrants close monitoring as traders navigate the implications of these developments on their positions.

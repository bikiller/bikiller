The Australian Dollar (AUD) experienced a slight decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, retreating from gains of over 1% achieved in the previous session. As traders await the Federal Reserve's policy decision, the AUD/USD exchange rate reflects a cautious sentiment in the market, with the pair showing vulnerability amid rising demand for the USD.

Market analysts suggest that the Fed's upcoming announcement could lead to further volatility in the forex market, impacting the AUD's position. The current trading environment emphasizes the strength of the USD, which is benefiting from expectations of continued monetary tightening. As traders monitor key technical levels, any shifts in policy or economic forecasts from the Fed could significantly influence the AUD/USD dynamics in the coming days.

The USD/JPY exchange rate saw a notable decline during the late North American session, as risk-off sentiment dominated markets. U.S. equities closed lower, prompting investors to seek safer assets. The Japanese Yen, traditionally viewed as a safe haven, strengthened against the U.S. Dollar, with the pair slipping below key technical levels, trading at 134.80 at the close.

As risk aversion continues, the Yen is poised to extend its gains into Tuesday’s trading. The renewed demand for safe-haven assets, including Gold and JPY, comes after a tariff ruling that heightened concerns in global markets. This shift in investor sentiment indicates potential further weakness for the USD/JPY, especially if equity markets remain under pressure in the coming days.

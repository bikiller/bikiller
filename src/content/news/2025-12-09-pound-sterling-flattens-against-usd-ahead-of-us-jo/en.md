The Pound Sterling (GBP) has stabilized against the US Dollar (USD), trading in a narrow range above 1.3300 during the European session on Tuesday. The GBP/USD currency pair is showing little movement as traders remain cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy announcement scheduled for Wednesday. Market participants are closely monitoring this event, which may significantly influence the exchange rate.

As investors await key insights from the Fed regarding interest rates and economic outlook, trading remains subdued. The anticipation of US Job Openings data adds to the market's volatility, with expectations that these figures could impact the USD's strength. The current trading environment reflects a wait-and-see approach, with the GBP/USD pair poised for potential shifts depending on the Fed's decisions and accompanying economic indicators.

The EUR/USD currency pair has retreated from its recent highs, currently trading at 1.1710 after encountering resistance at the 1.1740 level. This pullback comes amid disappointing data from the Eurozone's services sector, which has dampened investor sentiment and contributed to the decline in the exchange rate.

Traders are closely monitoring the impact of this data on the overall market, as weaker services activity could influence the European Central Bank's monetary policy decisions. The market's reaction suggests that the recent gains in the EUR/USD may be unsustainable in the face of such economic indicators, prompting speculation about future movements in the pair.

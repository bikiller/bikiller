The NZD/USD currency pair rebounded to approximately 0.5745 during the Asian session on Monday, breaking a four-day losing streak. This uptick in the exchange rate comes as renewed concerns about the independence of the US Federal Reserve put selling pressure on the US Dollar (USD), giving the Kiwi (NZD) a much-needed boost.

Traders are reacting to the evolving narrative surrounding the Fed's autonomy, which has contributed to fluctuations in the USD. As concerns mount, currency markets are seeing increased volatility, impacting the trading dynamics of major pairs like NZD/USD. The current technical level near 0.5750 may serve as a critical resistance point for the pair moving forward.

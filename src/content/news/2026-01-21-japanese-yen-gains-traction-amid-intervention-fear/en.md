The Japanese Yen (JPY) has gained momentum against the U.S. Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, rebounding after a day marked by volatile price movements. The currency pair fluctuated significantly, with the exchange rate reflecting heightened market sensitivity to potential intervention and expectations surrounding a hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ).

As traders react to these developments, the JPY looks set to extend its gains. Market participants are closely monitoring technical levels with the USD/JPY pair currently testing resistance around 110.50. A firm move above this level could signal further bullish momentum, reinforcing the Yen's position amid ongoing speculation about tighter monetary policy from the BoJ in the near future.

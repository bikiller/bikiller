Gold (XAU/USD) continues to trade under pressure during the early European session, although it has managed a modest recovery after hitting a daily low. The precious metal is currently holding above the $1,900 level, boosted by a slight rebound from the session's trough. Despite this, the overall tone remains subdued as risk sentiment improves and the US dollar strengthens.

The rebound in gold comes amid a positive risk tone in global markets, with investor sentiment lifting and supporting the USD. Additionally, expectations of a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve are being tempered by the dollar’s upward movement. As traders remain cautious, gold’s struggle to hold onto gains reflects broader concerns over the currency pair dynamics and shifting market sentiment.

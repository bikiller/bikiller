The US Dollar (USD) experienced a sharp reversal this week, retreating from Tuesday's gains amid rising concerns over the Federal Reserve's independence and increasing speculation about potential interest rate cuts later in the year. As the market digests this uncertainty, the USD's exchange rate against the Euro (EUR/USD) has been particularly volatile, trading around 1.1000, down from earlier highs.

Market participants are closely monitoring upcoming US economic data and comments from Fed officials, which could further influence currency pairs. In contrast, the UK is set to release its GDP figures, adding another layer of complexity to the forex landscape. Traders are keenly aware that these developments could significantly impact market sentiment and trading strategies, particularly for the USD and its peers.

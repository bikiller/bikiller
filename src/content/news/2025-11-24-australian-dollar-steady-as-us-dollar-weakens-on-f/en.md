The Australian Dollar (AUD) remained steady against the US Dollar (USD) as traders anticipated a key inflation report later this week. The currency pair is trading around 0.6500, reflecting a cautious optimism as market participants weigh the potential impact of Federal Reserve rate cut bets. The weakening of the USD has contributed to this stability, with investors closely watching how upcoming economic data might influence monetary policy.

Market sentiment suggests that the AUD could benefit from any further decline in the USD, particularly if inflation figures indicate a slowdown. Meanwhile, the EUR/USD pair continues to face volatility, currently hovering near 1.0800. As the forex market reacts to these developments, traders are urged to monitor technical levels closely, as shifts in sentiment could lead to significant trading opportunities in the coming days.

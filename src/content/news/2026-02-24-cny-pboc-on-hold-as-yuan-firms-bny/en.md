The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) held its 1-year and 5-year Loan Prime Rates (LPR) steady at 3% and 3.5%, respectively, signaling a balanced approach to supporting economic growth while maintaining currency stability. This decision comes despite ongoing deflationary pressures and weaker-than-expected GDP data. The PBoC continues to focus on boosting services consumption to stabilize the economy, with little change to monetary policy in the near term.

As the PBoC refrains from further rate cuts, the Chinese Yuan (CNY) firmed against major currencies, including the USD, as traders digested the central bank's stance. The Yuan's resilience suggests market confidence in the authorities' approach to balancing growth and inflation concerns. In the forex market, the USD/CNY exchange rate showed a cautious movement, reflecting the cautious tone of Chinese monetary policy.

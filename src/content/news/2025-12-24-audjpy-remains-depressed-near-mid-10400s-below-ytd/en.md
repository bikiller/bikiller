The AUD/JPY currency pair remains under pressure, trading around the mid-104.00s during the first half of the European session. This marks a slight pullback from its recent peak, reflecting modest intraday losses as the Japanese yen benefits from a hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). The exchange rate continues to hover near its highest level since July 2024, reached just the previous day.

Despite the current dip, the AUD/JPY has shown resilience, with sellers unable to drive prices significantly lower. The recent gains for the yen suggest a cautious market sentiment, influenced by the BoJ's monetary policy outlook. Traders will be keen to monitor developments in this currency pair, as any shifts in economic indicators could lead to increased volatility in exchange rates for both the AUD and JPY.

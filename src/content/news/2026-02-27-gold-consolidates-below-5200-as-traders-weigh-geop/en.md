Gold (XAU/USD) is holding steady below $5,200 on Friday, consolidating after mild losses as the market pauses within this week's established range. Traders are carefully monitoring global geopolitical developments and the Federal Reserve's upcoming rate decisions, which continue to weigh on market sentiment. The precious metal remains sensitive to fluctuations in USD and broader economic indicators.

With no clear breakout in either direction, the gold market is largely reacting to external factors, including the ongoing political instability and uncertainty surrounding U.S. interest rates. Investors are balancing the need for safe-haven assets against the Fed's stance on monetary tightening. The technical level of $5,200 remains a critical point, with short-term trading confined within this zone.

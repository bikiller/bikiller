The Euro (EUR) slipped against the British Pound (GBP) on Wednesday, with the EUR/GBP exchange rate fluctuating within its established one-week range as traders exercise caution ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. This decline reflects the ongoing divergence in monetary policies between the European Central Bank and the Fed, influencing market sentiment.

Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward momentum, climbing to around $5,050 during the early Asian session on Tuesday. The precious metal’s strength is driven by escalating concerns over financial instability and geopolitical tensions, which are fueling demand for safe-haven assets. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, which have boosted gold’s appeal as a store of value.

Later on Tuesday, the release of key US data, including the ADP Employment Change and Consumer Confidence reports, could impact market sentiment. These reports may provide further insight into the health of the US economy and influence the USD’s performance. Any surprises in the data could lead to notable fluctuations in gold prices, as traders adjust their positions ahead of potential shifts in the Fed’s policy outlook.

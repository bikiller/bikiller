USD/CHF held steady above the 0.7700 mark on Wednesday, trading around 0.7717, reflecting a modest gain of 0.20% on the day. The currency pair is experiencing subdued trading ahead of the release of the Federal Reserve’s meeting minutes, with investors awaiting further insights into the central bank's stance on interest rates. The cautious sentiment comes amid broader market uncertainty.

The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Swiss franc is maintaining a firm grip above 0.7700, with traders eyeing key developments in U.S. monetary policy. While movement has been limited, any hawkish signals from the Fed could trigger volatility in the USD/CHF pair. As the market digests potential policy shifts, the near-term outlook for the pair remains dependent on upcoming economic data and central bank commentary.

Gold (XAU/USD) remains steady below the $4,150 mark, holding just below a one-and-a-half-week high as traders weigh the implications of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The precious metal has shown a slight uptick in intraday trading, reflecting a mildly positive sentiment as the European session approaches.

Despite this tempered optimism, gold's inability to break past the $4,150 resistance level suggests that market participants are cautious. The ongoing speculation regarding Fed policy adjustments, combined with rising geopolitical risks, continues to influence trading behavior in the currency markets, particularly affecting the USD's strength against other currencies like the EUR. As these factors unfold, the dynamics of gold trading will likely remain closely tied to developments in U.S. monetary policy and global stability.

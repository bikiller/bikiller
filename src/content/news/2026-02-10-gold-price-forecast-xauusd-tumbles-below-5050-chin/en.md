Gold (XAU/USD) dropped to around $5,030 during the Asian session on Tuesday, marking a decline after a two-day rally. The pullback came as investors shifted back to equities, driven by a boost in risk sentiment. The price of the precious metal, which had gained recently, faces pressure as the broader market sentiment strengthens.

Despite the recent decline, buying interest from China is expected to limit further downside for gold. Market participants are monitoring key levels, with the $5,050 mark being a critical support. If buying continues, XAU/USD could stabilize, preventing any significant drops below this threshold. The current market movement reflects ongoing shifts in risk appetite and market rotation between asset classes.

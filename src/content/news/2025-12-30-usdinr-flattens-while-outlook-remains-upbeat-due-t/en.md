The USD/INR currency pair opened nearly flat on Tuesday, signaling a stable exchange rate as the Indian Rupee (INR) trades around 82.50 against the US Dollar (USD). This steadiness comes despite ongoing selling pressure from Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs), whose consistent withdrawal from Indian markets has created underlying tensions in the currency space.

Market analysts maintain an optimistic outlook for the INR, attributing its resilience to strong economic fundamentals and robust domestic demand. While FIIs have shown a preference for profit-taking, the overall sentiment suggests that the INR may find support in the coming days, with key technical levels being closely monitored for any potential breakouts or reversals.

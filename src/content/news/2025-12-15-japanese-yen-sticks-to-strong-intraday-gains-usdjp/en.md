The Japanese Yen (JPY) is maintaining strong intraday gains as the early European session unfolds, showing resilience against the US Dollar (USD). As the USD/JPY currency pair hovers near the critical level of 155.00, the Yen appears to be gaining momentum, buoyed by expectations of a hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). 

Market analysts suggest that ongoing speculation regarding the BoJ's potential policy adjustments could further support the Yen's appreciation. As traders navigate these developments, the exchange rate dynamics between the JPY and USD are likely to be closely watched, with implications for broader market sentiment and positioning across various currency pairs.

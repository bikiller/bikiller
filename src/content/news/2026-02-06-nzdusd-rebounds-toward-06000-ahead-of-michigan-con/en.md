NZD/USD is showing signs of recovery, rebounding from two consecutive days of losses to trade around 0.5980 during early European hours on Friday. This uptick comes as traders prepare for the preliminary February reading of the US Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index, a key indicator that could influence market sentiment and impact the exchange rate.

The upcoming data release is expected to attract considerable attention, as it may provide insights into consumer confidence and spending, factors crucial for the USD's performance. With the NZD/USD currency pair hovering near the psychological level of 0.6000, market participants will closely monitor any shifts in the index that could drive further trading activity and affect the dynamics between the New Zealand dollar and the US dollar.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling to gain momentum against a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD), hovering near a one-year low of 147.66. Despite a slight uptick during intraday trading, the currency pair remains under pressure as concerns over political stability and the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy persist. Market sentiment indicates a lack of confidence in the Yen's ability to sustain upward movement.

The ongoing uncertainty regarding Japan's political landscape, coupled with the BoJ's commitment to low-interest rates, has led to a volatile exchange rate environment. As the USD continues to dominate, traders are closely monitoring technical levels for potential signs of reversal. If the JPY fails to recover, it could face further depreciation, raising questions about the broader implications for Japan's economy and its export-driven sectors.

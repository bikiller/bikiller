The AUD/USD exchange rate is facing downward pressure despite ongoing support from commodity prices. The Australian Dollar has benefited from commodity-driven strength, but recent data shows a slowdown in economic momentum. Australia's Westpac-Melbourne Institute Leading Index has sharply decelerated, signaling stalled growth and raising concerns about the sustainability of the AUD's rally.

This economic slowdown comes even as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) maintains a hawkish stance on monetary policy. The central bank's bias toward tightening continues to support the Australian Dollar in the short term, but with growth signals weakening, the currency pair's potential for further gains may be limited. Traders will be watching for any shifts in RBA rhetoric or further economic indicators that could influence the AUD/USD outlook.

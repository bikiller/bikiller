EUR/JPY is currently testing a high of 183.15 as traders brace for key decisions from central banks. The pair's movement reflects ongoing market speculation that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will announce an interest rate hike in its upcoming meeting on Friday. This potential shift in policy could significantly impact the yen's value against the euro.

Despite the optimism surrounding a possible rate increase, the yen continues to lag, indicating that traders may be cautious ahead of the announcement. The exchange rate dynamics between the EUR and JPY underscore the broader market sentiment, as participants weigh the implications of central bank policies on currency trading strategies. As the situation unfolds, the focus will remain on how these decisions could reshape the forex landscape.

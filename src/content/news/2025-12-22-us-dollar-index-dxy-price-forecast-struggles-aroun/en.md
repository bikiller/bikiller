The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the currency's strength against a basket of currencies, is currently facing challenges in maintaining momentum above the mid-98.00s level. After a rebound from its lowest point since early August, the index is trading with a slight negative bias during the early European session, indicating cautious market sentiment.

As traders monitor the DXY's performance around the crucial 100-day Simple Moving Average, the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and major currency pairs, including the EUR, are likely to be influenced. A sustained struggle at this technical level could lead to increased volatility in forex trading, impacting strategies for investors looking to capitalize on shifts in the dollar's value.

The Indian Rupee (INR) made significant gains against the US Dollar (USD) in the early trading session on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair plummeting over 1% to around 90.00. This sharp decline followed the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) proactive intervention in both the spot and Non-deliverable Forward (NDF) markets, which effectively stemmed the rupee's decline.

The RBI's actions come in response to the rupee's recent struggles, having reached an all-time high of 91.56 against the dollar. This market movement underscores the central bank's commitment to stabilizing the exchange rate and mitigating excessive volatility in the currency markets, ensuring a more favorable trading environment for the INR.

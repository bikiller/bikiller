USD/CAD remains steady above the critical support level of 1.3800 as traders closely monitor the upcoming Federal Reserve’s decision. The exchange rate reflects a cautious optimism, with the market anticipating that the Fed will maintain its current policy stance. This stability in the USD allows the Canadian Dollar (CAD) to hold its ground, particularly as the Bank of Canada is expected to keep interest rates at 2.25%.

Market sentiment also hints at a potential 25 basis points rate hike from the Bank of Canada over the next year, which could bolster the CAD further. With swaps pricing in this gradual tightening, the CAD may strengthen against the USD in the medium term. As traders prepare for the Fed's announcement, the focus remains on how these monetary policies will influence the trading dynamics of this key currency pair.

The USD/JPY currency pair is retreating from recent highs, trading around 158.30 on Thursday. The pair is facing broad weakness in the US Dollar, which has pressured the exchange rate lower after it reached a one-week peak earlier in the European session. The decline reflects a shift in market sentiment, with traders awaiting key economic data and central bank decisions.

The Bank of Japan’s upcoming policy meeting and Japan's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report remain in focus. With inflation data and potential monetary policy signals at the forefront, investors are adjusting their positions accordingly. The weakening USD is adding further pressure, but the yen's movement could be influenced by further developments in Japan’s economic outlook and the BoJ’s stance on inflation control.

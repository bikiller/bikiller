The US Dollar strengthened against all G10 currencies after President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve Chair. This move is seen as potentially boosting the central bank's independence and alleviating fears of the Dollar’s depreciation. Following the announcement, the USD gained momentum, with notable rises across major currency pairs, including the EUR/USD, which saw the exchange rate dip below 1.1700.

The markets responded positively to the nomination, pushing the USD higher as investors anticipated more hawkish Fed policies. The EUR/USD slipped to a low of 1.1675, while the USD/JPY climbed above 113.00. As expectations of a shift in the Fed's leadership solidified, the Dollar's outlook strengthened, with analysts predicting continued bullish momentum against the euro and other G10 currencies in the near term.

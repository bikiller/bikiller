EUR/USD is experiencing modest gains during Tuesday's European trading session, currently exchanging at 1.1530. Despite the slight upward movement, the currency pair remains capped below the key resistance level of 1.1550. Traders are closely monitoring the market as they await upcoming US economic data, including Retail Sales and Producer Price Index (PPI) figures, which are expected to influence the exchange rate.

The anticipation surrounding these data releases is contributing to the cautious sentiment in the forex market, with investors weighing the potential implications for the USD. A stronger-than-expected performance in US economic indicators could bolster the dollar, potentially pushing EUR/USD lower, while disappointing figures might support the euro's position. As the market awaits clarity, trading remains focused on these pivotal data points that could determine the pair's next move.

The US Dollar is facing downward pressure as it begins the week, with the DXY index slipping further following a weak close on Friday. Analysts at Scotiabank, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, highlighted that the EUR/USD, USD/CHF, and USD/JPY pairs have all seen notable shifts. The DXY, which tracks the US Dollar against a basket of major currencies, lost ground as the Swiss Franc, Euro, and Japanese Yen made solid gains.

The softer tone for the USD reflects growing market concerns as key data risks loom. Trading activity has been influenced by an overall risk-off sentiment, with the greenback underperforming as investor focus turns to potential economic indicators. The EUR/USD rose above 1.0950, while USD/JPY weakened near the 130.50 level, signaling a broader shift in risk dynamics that could shape the market outlook in the coming days.

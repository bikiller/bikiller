GBP/USD remained steady on Tuesday, trading within a tight range as the Pound held just below the 1.3700 mark against the US Dollar. Market participants exercised caution ahead of the Bank of England's (BoE) upcoming policy decision, the first of 2026, which is expected to influence the currency pair's near-term direction.

The cautious tone in the markets reflected uncertainty about the BoE's stance on interest rates, with traders awaiting further guidance on economic conditions.

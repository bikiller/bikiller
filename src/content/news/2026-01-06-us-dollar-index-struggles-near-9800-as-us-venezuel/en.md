The US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is experiencing a decline, trading around 98.20 during Asian trading hours on Tuesday. This marks the second consecutive session of losses for the index, reflecting a weakened position for the dollar amid easing tensions between the US and Venezuela. The ongoing geopolitical developments appear to have influenced market sentiment, impacting USD's exchange rate against other currencies.

As traders assess the implications of these tensions, the dollar's struggle to hold above the critical 98.00 level may signal a shift in market dynamics. Currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY are likely to feel the effects of this downward momentum, as investors recalibrate their positions in response to the changing landscape. The ongoing fluctuations highlight the importance of geopolitical factors in foreign exchange trading, as the market reacts to both economic fundamentals and external pressures.

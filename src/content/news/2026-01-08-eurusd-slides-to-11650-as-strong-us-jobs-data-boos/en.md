The EUR/USD currency pair slid to 1.1650 on Thursday, marking its fourth consecutive day of decline. This downward movement was primarily driven by robust U.S. jobs data that exceeded expectations, bolstering the strength of the Dollar. Traders reacted to the positive labor market indicators, which reinforced the outlook for a resilient U.S. economy.

In contrast, economic data from the Eurozone suggested that the European Central Bank's easing cycle has come to an end, with a notable deflation in producer prices reported for December. As the exchange rate continues to reflect these diverging economic signals, traders are closely monitoring further developments, particularly in U.S. employment statistics, which may continue to influence the USD’s strength against the EUR.

The USD/JPY currency pair is maintaining its position near the key level of 157.00, reflecting a solid three-day gain as trading continues in the European session on Wednesday. The exchange rate is being closely monitored ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy decision, which could influence market sentiment and further drive the pair's movements.

The resilience of the USD against the JPY suggests a potential shift in investor confidence, as traders await insights from the Fed. Given the current economic landscape, any indications of interest rate adjustments could create volatility in the forex market, particularly for the USD/JPY exchange rate. As the day progresses, market participants will be keenly analyzing any statements from the Fed that could affect the dollar's performance against the yen.

Gold (XAU/USD) has surged to nearly $4,900, driven by heightened risk aversion in the financial markets. Concerns surrounding escalating tensions between the US and the EU have prompted investors to seek safe-haven assets, pushing gold prices higher. This shift reflects broader trends in de-dollarisation, as market participants increasingly explore alternatives to the USD amidst geopolitical uncertainties.

The current exchange rate for XAU/USD highlights gold's resilience in the face of market volatility. As traders respond to the evolving landscape, the demand for gold remains strong, reinforcing its status as a preferred asset during turbulent times. This upward movement in gold prices signals potential challenges for the USD, especially as investors weigh the implications of ongoing geopolitical conflicts and their impact on global economic stability.

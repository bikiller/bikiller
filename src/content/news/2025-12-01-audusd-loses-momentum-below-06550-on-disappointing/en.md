The AUD/USD pair experienced a decline during the early European session on Monday, trading around 0.6540. This marks the end of a six-day winning streak as the Australian Dollar (AUD) retreated from two-week highs against the US Dollar (USD). The downturn was largely influenced by disappointing economic data from China, which failed to meet market expectations.

As traders reassess the implications of the weaker-than-anticipated Chinese PMI, the exchange rate for AUD/USD reflects growing caution. This shift in momentum may prompt investors to closely monitor further economic indicators from both Australia and China, as these could significantly influence future trading dynamics and sentiment in this currency pair.

The US Dollar (USD) extended its gains on Tuesday, buoyed by optimism ahead of the final Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting of the year. As traders positioned themselves for potential policy shifts, the USD benefited from robust data, including a strong weekly ADP employment report and favorable JOLTS job openings figures. This positive sentiment helped the USD maintain a dominant stance against major currency pairs.

In the forex market, the exchange rate of EUR/USD reflected this strength, dipping as the USD strengthened. Traders now look ahead to the FOMC outcome, which could further impact the USD's trajectory. Improved economic indicators have heightened expectations for a more hawkish stance from the Fed, reinforcing the greenback's bullish momentum amidst cautious market sentiment.

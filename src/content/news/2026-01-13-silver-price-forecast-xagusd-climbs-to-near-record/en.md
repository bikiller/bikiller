Silver prices (XAG/USD) are experiencing a surge, currently trading around $85.75 in the early European session on Tuesday. This upward movement brings the precious metal closer to its record high, as traders flock to safe-haven assets amid growing uncertainty surrounding the US Federal Reserve's independence. The evolving economic landscape is prompting many to seek refuge in silver, reflecting broader concerns over monetary policy.

As the market reacts to fluctuations in the USD and global economic indicators, the exchange rate for silver demonstrates the metal's appeal amidst ongoing volatility. Traders are closely monitoring developments related to Fed policy, which could significantly influence trading strategies in the near term. With demand for safe-haven metals on the rise, silver's trajectory remains bullish, suggesting potential for further gains as investors navigate these turbulent market conditions.

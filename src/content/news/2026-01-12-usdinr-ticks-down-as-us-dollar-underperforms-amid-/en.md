The USD/INR currency pair is experiencing a slight decline as the US Dollar struggles amid ongoing tensions between former President Trump and Federal Reserve Chairman Powell. This performance comes as the Indian Rupee (INR) remains relatively stable against its peers at the week's onset, yet faces persistent pressures from rising oil prices and continued outflows of foreign investment from Indian equities.

Despite these challenges, the INR is holding its ground, with the exchange rate reflecting a cautious market sentiment. Traders are closely monitoring the impact of external factors, particularly fluctuations in oil prices and potential shifts in investor confidence, which could further influence the rupee's performance. The ongoing geopolitical dynamics and their implications for the USD may also play a crucial role in shaping future trading patterns in the forex market.

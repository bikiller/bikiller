The Japanese Yen (JPY) has rebounded against a weaker US Dollar (USD), ending a two-day losing streak. In Thursday's trading session, the JPY gained momentum as the USD faced downward pressure due to a softer risk sentiment in global markets. The USD/JPY exchange rate reflects this shift, with the pair moving lower as traders reacted to the diverging monetary policies of the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve.

Market analysts noted that the Yen's recovery comes amid a backdrop of cautious trading, influenced by uncertainty surrounding economic indicators. As investors reassess risk, the JPY is benefiting from its safe-haven status. The USD's overall weakness also contributed to this dynamic, as USD/EUR exchange rates have shown fluctuations, signaling a broader trend of dollar depreciation in the forex market.

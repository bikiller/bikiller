The US Dollar Index weakens toward the 97.00 level during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, reflecting softer USD demand amid growing uncertainty around Federal Reserve policy and renewed fears of a potential US government shutdown. The pullback in the exchange rate highlights cautious trading conditions as investors reassess near-term monetary and fiscal risks.

Market participants remain reluctant to take aggressive USD positions ahead of key US macroeconomic releases. The ADP Employment Change and Consumer Confidence data later in the day are expected to provide fresh insight into the health of the US labor market and domestic demand. Any downside surprise could add further pressure on the Dollar, influencing major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD.

From a broader forex perspective, a sustained move below the 97.00 technical area could reinforce bearish momentum for the USD in the near term. This scenario may support rival currencies, particularly the Euro, as traders adjust interest rate expectations and risk exposure. Until clearer signals emerge from economic data and Fed communication, volatility across currency markets is likely to remain elevated.

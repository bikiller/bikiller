West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have dipped below $58.50, currently trading around $58.20 during Asian trading hours on Wednesday. This decline comes as the US Dollar strengthens following the release of positive job data, enhancing the greenback's appeal in the forex market. The exchange rate fluctuations have pressured oil prices as investors reassess the outlook for energy demand amid a stronger USD.

Additionally, the resumption of operations at an oilfield in Iraq has added to the bearish sentiment in the market. The increased supply from this key producer coincides with a robust dollar, which typically dampens demand for commodities priced in USD. As traders navigate these dynamics, the correlation between the USD's performance and oil prices remains a critical focus, influencing trading strategies in both currency and commodity markets.

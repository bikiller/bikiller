Gold prices retreated from a three-week high of $5,249 on Tuesday, as the US Dollar gained strength. The pullback came after the Greenback recovered some of its Monday losses, driven by uncertainty surrounding trade policies and hawkish remarks from Federal Reserve officials. As a result, XAU/USD traded at $5,160, down 1.24% at the time of writing.

The market's focus shifted to the Fed's tone, which hinted at a more aggressive approach to interest rate hikes. This, coupled with global trade concerns, helped lift the USD against gold. The price action in the XAU/USD pair suggests continued volatility, with traders closely monitoring US economic data and Fed commentary for further direction in both the gold and currency markets.

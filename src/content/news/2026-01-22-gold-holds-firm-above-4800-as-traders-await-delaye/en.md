Gold (XAU/USD) remains resilient above the $4,800 mark on Thursday, recovering from an earlier dip below this psychological level. At present, the precious metal trades around $4,822, as traders reposition ahead of a series of key US economic releases expected later in the session. The pullback was brief, and the market sentiment remains focused on upcoming data, which could impact the USD and broader market dynamics.

The delay in the release of the US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data has left traders in a holding pattern, adjusting their positions as they await further direction. The exchange rate for XAU/USD reflects this cautious optimism, as investors assess potential shifts in Federal Reserve policy. The near-term outlook for gold will likely be influenced by the strength of the USD and the outcome of the delayed economic reports.

EUR/GBP remains relatively stable as traders await key interest rate decisions from the Bank of England (BoE) and the European Central Bank (ECB) this week. The pair has shown little movement in early trading, staying within a tight range. The Euro (EUR) is hovering around 0.8560 against the British Pound (GBP), with the exchange rate largely uninfluenced by other market events. 

Market participants are refraining from making large directional moves, as both central banks prepare to announce their monetary policy stances. Expectations are mixed, with traders closely watching for any signs of further tightening from the BoE or shifts in the ECB’s approach to inflation. The outcome of these meetings could significantly impact the EUR/GBP exchange rate in the coming days.

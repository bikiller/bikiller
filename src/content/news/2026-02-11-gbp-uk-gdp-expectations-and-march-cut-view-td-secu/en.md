TD Securities projects a 0.1% monthly growth for UK GDP in December, with manufacturing driving the increase while services remain unchanged. This modest growth outlook leaves the Q4 2025 GDP at 0.2% quarter-on-quarter, aligning with consensus and the Monetary Policy Report (MPR) forecasts. The relatively flat services sector suggests a lack of significant momentum in the broader economy.

As the UK economy faces slower growth, the GBP/USD exchange rate may remain under pressure in the near term. With the BoE’s cautious stance and subdued economic performance, traders are likely to keep a close eye on further data releases for clearer direction. Expectations for a March interest rate cut remain intact, which could weigh on the British pound as market sentiment continues to focus on the risks of a slowing recovery.

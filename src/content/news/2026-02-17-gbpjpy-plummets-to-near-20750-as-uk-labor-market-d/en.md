The GBP/JPY currency pair fell nearly 0.85% to around 207.50 during the European trading session on Tuesday, as the Pound Sterling faced significant selling pressure. The sharp decline follows disappointing labor market data from the UK, covering the three months ending in December. Traders reacted to signs of economic weakness, driving the exchange rate lower.

The release of weaker-than-expected labor market figures highlighted a slowdown in the UK economy, undermining investor confidence in the Pound. With the GBP/USD also under pressure, the GBP/JPY faced additional headwinds as broader market sentiment remained cautious. The pair’s drop to the 207.50 level suggests further downside risks if upcoming data continues to support concerns over the UK’s economic outlook.

The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing a downward trend, trading near 155.75 during the early Asian session on Monday. The exchange rate reflects a weakening of the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen, driven by growing expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in the coming year. This outlook is prompting traders to reevaluate their positions.

Market sentiment is further influenced by speculation around a possible rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). As the USD softens, the JPY gains traction, positioning the Japanese currency favorably in the current trading environment. The movement below the key technical level of 156.00 underscores the shifting dynamics in the forex market, with investors keenly monitoring developments from both central banks.

Oil prices rose as risk sentiment improved amid growing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in December. This bullish outlook is driving traders to reassess values across various markets, with the focus shifting to how potential peace talks in Ukraine could impact global supply dynamics. As demand prospects brighten, the crude market finds itself in a favorable trading environment.

The anticipation of a softer monetary policy from the Fed is also influencing currency exchange rates.

The US Dollar has seen modest support ahead of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, benefiting from a risk-off market environment dominated by a tech-led selloff. ING strategists highlight that the Dollar's slight strength is also attributed to its short-term undervaluation against its G10 peers. As a result, the USD is finding some stability, particularly in the USD/EUR currency pair, which remains near key technical levels.

The market's cautious tone has contributed to the Dollar’s rise, with the exchange rate between USD and EUR holding steady amid concerns about economic growth. As traders await the CPI data, any significant surprise could shift the balance, potentially bolstering the USD further or reversing its gains. This dynamic underscores the ongoing uncertainty surrounding both the US economy and global market sentiment.

The EUR/JPY currency pair has seen a dip during the early European session on Tuesday, trading around 185.25. The Japanese Yen is gaining strength against the Euro as traders flock to safe-haven assets in response to renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump directed at European allies over Greenland. This shift in sentiment has led to a decrease in the exchange rate for EUR/JPY.

Despite the current retreat, the bullish outlook for EUR/JPY remains intact as long as the exchange rate holds above the critical level of 185.00. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) shows positive momentum, suggesting that the pair could regain upward traction if market conditions stabilize. Traders will be closely monitoring geopolitical developments and their potential impact on global currency trends.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) at 1.3645 during the European trading session on Monday. The GBP/USD currency pair is in a consolidation phase as traders await key labor market data for the UK. With market sentiment focused on the employment figures for the three months ending in December, the exchange rate has shown limited volatility.

The upcoming labor report is expected to be a critical catalyst for the pound, with any surprises potentially impacting the direction of GBP/USD. As investors remain cautious, the pair has stayed within a narrow range, reflecting uncertainty in market expectations. The data's release could offer a fresh outlook on the UK economy, influencing future trading moves against the dollar.

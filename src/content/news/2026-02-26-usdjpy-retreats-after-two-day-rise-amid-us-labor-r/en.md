USD/JPY is trading around 156.20 on Thursday, marking a 0.15% decline on the day as it retreats from its two-day upward trend. The pullback follows consecutive gains that saw the currency pair move higher, largely driven by strong US labor market data. Investors are also reacting to growing speculation surrounding potential rate hikes from the Bank of Japan, further influencing the exchange rate.

Despite the recent retreat, the USD/JPY remains near its multi-decade highs, with market participants closely monitoring both US economic resilience and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy stance. The strength of the US labor market continues to support the dollar, while any indications of tightening from the BoJ could add upward pressure on the currency pair in the near term.

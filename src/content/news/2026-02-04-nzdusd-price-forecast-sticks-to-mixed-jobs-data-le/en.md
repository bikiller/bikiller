The NZD/USD pair failed to maintain its upward momentum from the previous day and experienced a pullback during the Asian session on Wednesday. Mixed employment data from New Zealand prompted a wave of selling, pushing the exchange rate below the mid-0.6000s. Traders showed cautious sentiment as the currency pair struggled to build on recent gains.

The New Zealand Dollar faced headwinds after the mixed jobs report, dampening optimism for sustained growth in the currency. Despite some positive data points, the employment figures failed to fully meet market expectations, leading to a slight retreat in NZD/USD. The currency pair now trades with resistance around the 0.6050 level, and further downside risks could materialize if the USD continues to strengthen.

The USD/CAD currency pair continued its upward movement on Monday, with the US Dollar strengthening amidst solid PMI data, while the Canadian Dollar weakened under the pressure of falling oil prices. At the time of writing, the exchange rate for USD/CAD stands at 1.3676, reflecting a 0.44% increase for the day. This shift highlights the inverse relationship between oil prices and the Loonie, with lower crude impacting Canada's economy.

The Greenback's resurgence is largely driven by robust US PMI figures, signaling continued economic expansion. In contrast, the decline in oil prices weighs heavily on the Canadian Dollar, which is closely tied to oil exports. As USD/CAD trades higher, traders are closely monitoring potential resistance levels, with the pair approaching the 1.3700 mark. Market sentiment remains focused on these economic indicators, shaping the direction of the currency pair in the short term.

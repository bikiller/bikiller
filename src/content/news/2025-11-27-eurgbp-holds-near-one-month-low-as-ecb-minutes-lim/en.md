The Euro (EUR) remains under pressure against the British Pound (GBP) on Thursday, trading at approximately 0.8761, near a one-month low. This downturn follows a significant drop on Wednesday, triggered by the UK’s Autumn Budget announcement, which has bolstered sentiment for Sterling. The current exchange rate reflects a cautious market as traders digest the implications of fiscal policies.

The recent European Central Bank (ECB) minutes have limited further downside for the Euro, providing some support amidst the prevailing bearish sentiment. Despite this, the ongoing strength of the GBP continues to overshadow the Euro’s performance, affecting the EUR/GBP currency pair dynamics. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in the exchange rate could signal broader trends in the forex market.

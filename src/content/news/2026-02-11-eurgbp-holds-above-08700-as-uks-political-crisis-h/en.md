The EUR/GBP currency pair is holding steady above the 0.8700 mark, with the Euro (EUR) slightly weakening against the British Pound (GBP) on Wednesday. Despite the minor decline, EUR/GBP remains close to its seven-week high, hovering near the 0.8745 level. Traders are watching closely as the Pound struggles amid the ongoing political crisis in the UK, which has weighed on the currency.

The uncertainty surrounding the UK’s political situation continues to pressure the GBP, preventing any significant recovery in the exchange rate. EUR/GBP’s resilience near key resistance levels suggests that the Euro is benefiting from the Pound's weakness, with traders cautious of further volatility. A move above the 0.8745 high could signal additional strength for the Euro, while a pullback below 0.8700 would open the door for potential losses.

The EUR/GBP currency pair is trading in a steady range around the exchange rate of 0.8655 during the early hours of European trading on Tuesday. Market participants are closely watching for the upcoming release of German CPI inflation figures, which could influence the euro's movement against the British pound.

As traders anticipate the inflation data, the relatively stable position of the EUR/GBP pair reflects uncertainty in the market. Any significant deviation in the German CPI could create volatility in the exchange rate, impacting trading strategies and positioning as investors adjust to the potential implications for monetary policy in the Eurozone.

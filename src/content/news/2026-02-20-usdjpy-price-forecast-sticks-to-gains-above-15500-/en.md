The USD/JPY currency pair extended its positive momentum for the third consecutive day, rising to a fresh one-week high of 155.35-155.40 on Friday. The exchange rate has benefited from sustained buying pressure, maintaining gains above the 155.00 mark as investors anticipate upcoming U.S. economic data.

This upward movement in the USD/JPY pair comes ahead of critical U.S. reports, which are likely to influence market sentiment further. Traders are closely watching the data for insights into the U.S. economy and potential Federal Reserve actions, which could drive further fluctuations in the exchange rate.

USD/CAD is trading at approximately 1.3900 on Friday, reflecting a 0.25% increase for the day. The US Dollar's strength is bolstered by favorable labor data, contributing to its upward momentum. This rise in the USD is creating a more robust exchange rate against the Canadian Dollar, which is facing downward pressure.

The Canadian Dollar is being weighed down by declining oil prices, a key export for Canada. As crude prices retreat, the CAD struggles to maintain its footing against the USD. The interplay between these macroeconomic factors highlights the volatility in the currency pair, influencing trading strategies as investors react to the shifting landscape in both the US and Canadian economies.

EUR/CAD is trading higher around 1.6240 during the Asian hours on Monday, recovering from losses in the previous session. The pair's upward movement is largely attributed to a cautious sentiment regarding the European Central Bank's (ECB) monetary policy outlook, which has bolstered the Euro (EUR) against the Canadian Dollar (CAD).

As traders assess the implications of the ECB's stance, the exchange rate reflects increased support for the Euro. The cautious outlook may signal potential volatility ahead, influencing the trading strategies of forex participants. As EUR/CAD approaches the technical level near 1.6250, market watchers will be keen to see if the momentum continues in the coming sessions.

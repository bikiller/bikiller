West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have stabilized near $57.50 per barrel after a 2.5% decline in the previous session. Trading around $57.30 during European hours on Monday, investors are closely monitoring potential supply concerns stemming from delays in peace negotiations regarding Ukraine. The uncertainty surrounding global supply has prompted a reassessment of market dynamics.

As traders weigh these geopolitical risks, the impact on the oil market may influence broader currency pairs, particularly the USD and EUR. A sustained rise in oil prices could strengthen the dollar against other currencies, reflecting the interconnection between commodity prices and exchange rates. Market participants will be keenly observing how these developments unfold in the coming days.

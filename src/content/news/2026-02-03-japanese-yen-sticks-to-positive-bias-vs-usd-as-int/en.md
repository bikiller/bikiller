The Japanese Yen (JPY) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) during Tuesday’s Asian session, holding a positive bias as fears of potential currency intervention returned to the forefront. Japan’s Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama reignited concerns about a joint US-Japan intervention, which helped the Yen maintain its edge. USD/JPY traded around 146.80, down from recent highs, reflecting market apprehension over government actions.

Despite a slight dip in the US Dollar, the Yen’s gains were limited by ongoing fiscal concerns in Japan. While USD/JPY hovered near 146.80, Japanese authorities have expressed their readiness to act if the currency’s rapid depreciation persists. As the Yen remains on the offensive, traders are closely monitoring potential intervention, with the USD’s performance and global sentiment likely to influence further moves.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) declined against major currencies on Thursday, trading down 0.2% to approximately 1.3420 against the US Dollar (USD). This bearish movement follows the release of the UK’s strong monthly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for November, which unexpectedly shifted the economic narrative yet failed to bolster the currency. 

Despite the encouraging growth figures, traders appeared cautious, leading to the GBP's dip in the foreign exchange market. The exchange rate dynamics suggest that investor sentiment remains influenced by broader economic uncertainties, impacting the overall trading environment for GBP against peers such as the Euro (EUR) and USD. As market participants digest the implications of the GDP numbers, the Pound's trajectory will be closely monitored in the coming sessions.

WTI crude oil remains under pressure, trading around $62.80 per barrel during the Asian session on Friday. This follows a significant drop of over 3% in the previous session. The price continues to face headwinds due to persistent oversupply concerns, as the market grapples with potential excess production. Despite minor fluctuations, crude oil has struggled to break the $63.00 mark, signaling weak bullish momentum.

This downturn has implications for the broader forex market, particularly for USD-based pairs. The drop in oil prices weighs on inflation expectations, which could influence USD movements. A sustained dip in WTI prices may also impact major currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY, as lower energy costs could shift investor sentiment. Traders are closely monitoring oil supply data and geopolitical developments for further clues on market direction.

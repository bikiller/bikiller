AUD/USD traded at 0.7110 on Wednesday, gaining 0.56% on the day. The pair found support in a favorable external environment and hawkish comments from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). Despite a solid U.S. non-farm payroll (NFP) report, which typically strengthens the USD, the RBA’s stance is helping lift the Aussie dollar.

The RBA's more aggressive outlook on monetary policy, coupled with expectations for tighter Australian rates, has kept AUD/USD buoyant. Market participants are closely monitoring any further signals from the RBA that may impact future trading. With the exchange rate holding above 0.7100, the pair could see more volatility as both global and domestic factors influence its movement in the coming sessions.

EUR/USD advanced to 1.1760 during the North American trading session, reflecting a 0.42% increase. This upward movement comes as speculation intensifies regarding continued easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, which is putting downward pressure on the USD. The pair found support after bouncing off daily lows of 1.1706, highlighting a notable recovery in the exchange rate.

With scarce economic data from both the Eurozone and the U.S., traders are closely monitoring Fed signals and their potential impact on future monetary policy. The current dynamics suggest that the EUR could benefit from a weaker dollar if easing persists, prompting investors to adjust their positions in anticipation of further movements in this key currency pair.

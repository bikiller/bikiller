The USD/CHF currency pair remains under pressure, trading near 0.7720 during the Asian session on Thursday, after paring earlier losses. Despite recovering slightly, the pair continues to hover in negative territory, struggling to gain momentum as the Swiss Franc (CHF) benefits from safe-haven demand. Investors remain cautious amidst rising geopolitical tensions between the United States and Iran, alongside stalled talks between Russia and Ukraine.

The exchange rate of USD/CHF faces headwinds as the market awaits the release of the Swiss Trade Balance data, which could influence further movement. Safe-haven inflows continue to support the CHF, keeping the USD/CHF pair from significant upside. As geopolitical concerns persist, market participants are focused on how these developments might impact broader risk sentiment and the near-term outlook for the Swiss Franc.

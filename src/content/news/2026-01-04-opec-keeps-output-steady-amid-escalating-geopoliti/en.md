In a virtual meeting held on Sunday, OPEC+ members, including Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the UAE, unanimously agreed to maintain their current oil output levels. This decision comes amidst rising geopolitical tensions affecting several member nations, yet the group opted to sidestep discussions on these crises. As a result, oil prices have remained stable, influencing the USD and EUR exchange rates as traders adjust their positions in response to ongoing market conditions.

The decision to keep output steady may provide short-term support for crude prices, which could impact currency pairs like USD/JPY and EUR/USD as traders react to supply expectations. With geopolitical uncertainties still looming, the oil market remains sensitive to shifts in sentiment, which could lead to fluctuations in associated currency movements. Market participants will be closely monitoring these developments for potential trading opportunities.

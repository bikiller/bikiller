The Pound Sterling (GBP) is exhibiting stability against major currencies as trading begins this week, with the GBP/USD exchange rate holding steady around 1.3320. Market participants are eyeing upcoming economic indicators from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which could influence the currency pair's direction. 

In the broader context, the calm trading environment reflects a cautious approach among investors, as they await clarity on monetary policy. The relatively stable performance of the GBP may serve as a buffer against fluctuations in the EUR/GBP pair, particularly if the Fed signals any changes in interest rates that could impact the USD's strength.

USD/JPY continues its bullish trend for a fifth consecutive day, climbing 0.26% to approach 156.20 on Thursday. The pair's gains are driven by the ongoing strength of the US Dollar, which has been outperforming other major currencies. This persistent upward movement reflects robust market sentiment toward USD, especially following recent economic data that supports the currency’s dominance.

As the USD remains in focus, traders are closely watching the 156.20 level, which could signal further momentum for the currency pair. The persistent outperformance of the USD against the Japanese Yen underscores the impact of stronger US economic indicators and interest rate expectations. Market participants will likely continue to monitor global economic trends and central bank policies for potential shifts in this dynamic.

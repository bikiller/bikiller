The GBP/USD currency pair is experiencing positive momentum, currently trading at 1.3305 during the early European session on Wednesday. This uptick comes as the US dollar weakens against the Pound Sterling ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Market sentiment leans towards a consensus that the Fed is poised to implement another rate cut, which has further pressured the USD.

As traders eye the Fed's announcement, the exchange rate dynamics between GBP and USD are likely to remain volatile. A rate cut could bolster the Pound's strength, while the Greenback's decline may open up opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on currency fluctuations. Overall, the market is poised for significant movement based on the outcomes of the Federal Reserve's meeting later today.

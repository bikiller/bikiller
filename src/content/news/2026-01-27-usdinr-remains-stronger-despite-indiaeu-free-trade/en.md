The USD/INR currency pair continues to exhibit strength, maintaining its upward trajectory since January 15. Currently trading close to its all-time high of 91.96, reached on January 23, the exchange rate reflects a bullish sentiment in the market, undeterred by the recent India-European Union free trade agreement developments.

This persistent strength in the USD/INR exchange rate suggests robust demand for the US dollar amid shifting geopolitical landscapes. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of the trade agreement, yet the current momentum indicates a preference for the dollar, possibly driven by concerns over economic stability in the region. As the market evolves, participants will likely continue to assess the impact of these developments on future trading patterns.

EUR/GBP remains under pressure, trading around 0.8630 on Tuesday, just above its five-month low. The currency pair has shown limited movement as traders await key central bank decisions. With both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) set to make announcements, market participants are hesitant, wary of any shifts in monetary policy that could influence the exchange rate.

The cautious trading comes as investors closely monitor the economic landscape in both the eurozone and the UK. As the USD continues to assert strength in the global market, the EUR and GBP face headwinds, leading to subdued price action in EUR/GBP. Any surprises from the ECB or BoE could trigger volatility, making the 0.8600 level a critical point for traders to watch in the near term.

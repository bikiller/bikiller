West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading at approximately $58.10 in early Asian trading on Tuesday, maintaining a steady position as market participants evaluate the implications of recent political developments in Venezuela. The situation unfolds following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, raising questions about potential disruptions to oil flows from the country.

As traders closely monitor this geopolitical climate, fluctuations in Venezuela's oil production could significantly impact global supply and thus influence crude prices. The stability of WTI around the $58 mark underscores the market's cautious stance as it navigates uncertainty, which could potentially sway currency pairs involving the USD and EUR, particularly in relation to energy-dependent economies.

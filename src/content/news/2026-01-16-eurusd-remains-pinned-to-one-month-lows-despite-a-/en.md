EUR/USD remains under pressure, trading just above the key level of 1.1600 as of Friday. The pair is nearly flat on the day, indicating a lack of significant movement despite a softer US Dollar. This stagnation has the currency pair positioned to conclude a three-week losing streak, reflecting ongoing market uncertainty.

The current exchange rate shows that the euro is struggling to gain traction against the USD, even as the dollar weakens. Traders are closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that may influence future movements. As technical levels suggest continued bearish sentiment, the outlook for EUR/USD remains cautious, with traders remaining alert for potential reversals or further declines.

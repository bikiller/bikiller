Silver (XAG/USD) has surged to an all-time high, breaking above $110 as macroeconomic uncertainty drives increased demand for the precious metal. At the time of writing, the price stands at $109.50, marking a significant 6.90% gain for the day. The ongoing rally is fueled by growing concerns over global economic instability, prompting traders to seek safe-haven assets.

The sharp rise in silver prices highlights investor flight from riskier assets, with the USD and other major currencies facing pressure. As the broader market braces for potential disruptions, silver’s strong performance contrasts with weaker exchange rates in other commodities. Traders are closely watching technical levels, with the $110 mark acting as a key resistance point. If this level holds, further upside may be in the cards for the precious metal.

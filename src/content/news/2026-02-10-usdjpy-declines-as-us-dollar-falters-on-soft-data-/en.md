The USD/JPY currency pair is trading at 154.40 on Tuesday, marking a 0.95% decline on the day. The US dollar has been weighed down by weaker-than-expected economic data, with soft reports on consumer spending and manufacturing activity. As a result, the dollar’s momentum falters, leading to a pullback in the USD/JPY exchange rate.

On the other hand, the Japanese yen has gained stability, supported by a flight to safety as market sentiment grows cautious. As the US dollar struggles, the yen benefits from its safe-haven status, helping to solidify its position. The shift in momentum reflects growing concerns over global economic growth and inflationary pressures.

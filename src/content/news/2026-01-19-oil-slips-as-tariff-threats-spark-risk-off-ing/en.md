Oil prices faced downward pressure in early trading as a broader risk-off sentiment swept through the markets. The crude oil market is reacting negatively to President Trump's recent threat of a 10% tariff on several European nations opposing his Greenland acquisition plans. This geopolitical tension is influencing traders' decisions, causing a shift towards safer assets and affecting the overall demand for oil.

In response to these developments, the USD is gaining strength against the EUR, with the exchange rate reflecting increased investor caution. As market participants assess the potential impact of ongoing tariff threats, oil benchmarks are likely to remain volatile, further complicating trading strategies. The evolving situation may continue to sway currency pairs, urging traders to closely monitor economic indicators and geopolitical developments for clearer market direction.

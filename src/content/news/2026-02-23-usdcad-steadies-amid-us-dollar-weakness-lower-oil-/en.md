The USD/CAD currency pair is holding steady around 1.3665 on Monday, showing little change on the day. This stability follows a pullback from a monthly high last week, with the pair remaining below the key 1.3700 level. The US Dollar has been under pressure amid weaker overall performance, while lower oil prices have added downward pressure on the Canadian Dollar.

Despite attempts to stabilize, the pair's movements are closely tied to ongoing market dynamics. The US Dollar's weakness and declining oil prices have created a cautious trading environment, limiting any significant upward momentum for USD/CAD. Traders are eyeing potential support and resistance levels as the pair navigates the current market conditions.

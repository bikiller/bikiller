The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing fluctuations as the Japanese Yen gains strength amid increasing speculation of a Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike. After the US Presidents' Day holiday, trading activity picked up with USD/JPY moving between key levels. At the time of writing, the exchange rate hovers around 153.40, slightly off the intraday low of 152.70.

The Yen's firming has been driven by growing expectations that the BoJ could adjust its ultra-loose monetary policy soon. Meanwhile, the US Dollar remains stable, supported by a solid Fed outlook. The market is eyeing the next move by both central banks as USD/JPY's price action could signal further shifts in market sentiment, especially as traders digest global economic data.

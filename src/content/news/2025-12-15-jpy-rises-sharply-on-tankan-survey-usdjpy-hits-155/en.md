The Japanese Yen (JPY) experienced a notable rise, strengthening 0.5% against the US Dollar (USD) as the USD/JPY exchange rate fell to the significant 155 level. This uptick followed the release of the Q4 Tankan business survey, which influenced investor sentiment and trading strategies. 

Technical indicators suggest a bearish outlook ahead, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) dipping below the 50 mark. As traders assess the implications of the Tankan survey, the movement in the USD/JPY currency pair may signal a shift in market dynamics, potentially affecting future trading decisions and volatility in the forex market.

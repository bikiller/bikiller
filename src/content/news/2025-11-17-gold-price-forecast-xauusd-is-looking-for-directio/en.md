Gold (XAU/USD) is currently trading in a tight range just below the $4,100 mark, following a reversal from monthly highs around $4,250 reached last week. The precious metal has managed to hold above $4,040, but attempts to push higher have been met with resistance, keeping the exchange rate stagnant as market participants await clearer direction.

As Monday's trading unfolds, the lack of movement in gold prices reflects broader market dynamics, with traders closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical tensions. The cap below $4,100 suggests a cautious sentiment among investors, as they assess the implications of potential shifts in the USD and its impact on gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset.

Gold prices have surged for the fourth consecutive day, approaching the significant $4,500 level as geopolitical tensions overshadow rising US Treasury yields and a strengthening US Dollar. Currently, the XAU/USD currency pair is trading at $4,487, reflecting an increase of nearly 1%. This movement highlights gold's resilience amid fluctuating market conditions.

Despite the Greenback gaining 0.20% against other currencies, investor demand for gold remains robust, driven by ongoing global uncertainties. The exchange rate dynamics suggest that traders are prioritizing safe-haven assets like gold over the USD, indicating a potential shift in market sentiment as geopolitical fears continue to loom over financial markets.

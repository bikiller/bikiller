The AUD/USD currency pair surged 0.45% during the European trading session on Monday, reaching near 0.6640. The Australian Dollar is gaining traction as it outperforms the US Dollar, which is struggling against its peers. Market sentiment remains resilient, with traders increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will maintain interest rates in its first policy meeting of 2026.

This upward movement in the AUD/USD exchange rate reflects broader trends in the forex market as the USD continues to underperform. Analysts suggest that the strength of the Australian Dollar may also be supported by robust economic data from Australia, further enhancing its position against the USD and potentially other major currencies like the EUR. The current dynamics could pave the way for further volatility in the forex market as traders react to upcoming economic indicators and Fed statements.

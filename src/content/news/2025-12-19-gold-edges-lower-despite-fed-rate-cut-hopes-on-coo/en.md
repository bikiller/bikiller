Gold prices (XAU/USD) have dipped below $4,350 during early Asian trading on Friday, influenced by a mix of profit-taking and weak long liquidation from shorter-term futures traders. Despite growing expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut spurred by cooling US inflation, the precious metal's appeal has waned, leading to a modest decline in its value.

As traders reassess their positions, the shift in sentiment reflects broader market dynamics. The exchange rate for gold remains sensitive to fluctuations in the USD, with any signs of monetary easing potentially revitalizing demand. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as any sustained movement below the $4,350 level could signal further volatility in the gold market.

Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a significant decline on Friday, plunging nearly 2% to a low of $4,032 as market sentiment shifted following hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials. This rhetoric has diminished expectations for a rate cut in December, causing traders to reassess their positions and the future trajectory of the USD.

Despite the drop, gold managed to recover some ground, reflecting ongoing volatility in the market. The change in Fed sentiment has implications for the broader trading environment, particularly for currency pairs like EUR/USD, as investors closely monitor the Fed's next moves and their potential impact on exchange rates.

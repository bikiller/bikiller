The EUR/USD currency pair continues to decline, currently trading near the 1.1710 mark during the Asian session on Monday. This downward movement is primarily attributed to a strengthening US Dollar (USD), which has gained traction amid rising safe-haven demand. 

The increase in geopolitical tensions, particularly following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by U.S. forces, has spurred investor caution, pushing them towards the USD. As market participants react to these developments, the exchange rate for EUR/USD reflects this shift, suggesting potential further losses for the Euro (EUR) if safe-haven sentiment persists.

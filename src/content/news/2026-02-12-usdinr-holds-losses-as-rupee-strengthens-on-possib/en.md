USD/INR traded lower on Thursday after a brief recovery in the prior session. The pair saw a decline as the Indian Rupee (INR) gained strength, bolstered by potential intervention from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The Rupee found support, pushing USD/INR away from recent highs, with the pair trading around 83.08 at the close.

The market remained relatively stable despite rising US Treasury yields following strong US jobs data. Asian currencies held steady, reflecting a cautious optimism as investors digested the latest economic reports. While the strengthening INR was a key factor in the movement of USD/INR, broader global factors such as the US economic outlook continue to influence the trading range of the currency pair.

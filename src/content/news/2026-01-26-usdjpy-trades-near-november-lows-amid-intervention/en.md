The USD/JPY currency pair is hovering near its lowest point since November, with the exchange rate trading around 154.00. Earlier, the pair dipped to an intraday low of 153.31, reflecting a significant pullback. This comes amid heightened market speculation about potential intervention risks from Japanese authorities, which are keeping the Yen supported against the US Dollar.

Traders are closely awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision, which could provide further direction for USD/JPY. The growing concerns over intervention in the Japanese currency market, combined with the Fed's stance on interest rates, are creating uncertainty and volatility in the exchange rate. The Yen’s resilience against the USD suggests that market participants are positioning for heightened risk in the near term.

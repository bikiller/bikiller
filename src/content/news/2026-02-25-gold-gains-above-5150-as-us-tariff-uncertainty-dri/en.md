Gold prices (XAU/USD) rose modestly to $5,165 during the early Asian session on Thursday, reflecting a strong demand for the precious metal. The upward movement is largely driven by heightened geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran, coupled with lingering uncertainty surrounding US tariff policies. These factors have increased the safe-haven appeal of gold, pushing it above key resistance levels.

As markets closely monitor US-Iran diplomatic talks, traders are wary of further volatility, adding to the bullish sentiment in gold. Additionally, the ongoing tariff uncertainty is dampening investor confidence in the US dollar (USD), which has further bolstered gold's performance against major currencies. The price of gold remains sensitive to these external pressures, with potential for continued fluctuations as new developments emerge in the geopolitical and trade landscape.

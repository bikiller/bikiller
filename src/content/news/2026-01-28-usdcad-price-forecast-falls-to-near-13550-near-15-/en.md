The USD/CAD currency pair showed little movement during the European trading session on Wednesday, hovering around the 1.3570 level. This follows a near 1% drop in the previous session, with the pair recently touching a 15-month low near 1.3550. Despite this modest rebound, the Canadian dollar has been relatively resilient amid ongoing market volatility.

Traders continue to closely monitor global economic trends and central bank policies, with the USD facing pressure from weaker-than-expected data. As the US Federal Reserve navigates its monetary stance, fluctuations in the exchange rate between USD and CAD are expected to remain sensitive to both domestic economic releases and broader geopolitical factors.

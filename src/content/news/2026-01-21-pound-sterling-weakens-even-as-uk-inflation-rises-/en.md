The Pound Sterling (GBP) faced downward pressure against its major counterparts on Wednesday, despite a surprising uptick in UK inflation. The Office for National Statistics revealed that inflation rose significantly in December, surpassing expectations. This unexpected data typically supports a currency; however, GBP/USD saw a decline, trading around 1.3600, while GBP/EUR dropped to approximately 1.1700.

Traders reacted to the inflation data with caution, as the Bank of England’s potential monetary policy shifts remain uncertain. The stronger-than-anticipated inflation figures raised questions about future interest rate hikes, yet the Pound struggled to gain traction. As markets digest this news, GBP’s performance will be closely monitored, particularly in relation to movement against the USD and EUR.

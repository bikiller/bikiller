Gold (XAU/USD) has managed to hold onto modest gains during the early European session on Friday, maintaining its position above recent intraday lows. Despite this, it remains below the crucial $5,000 level, as investors remain cautious ahead of the US consumer price index (CPI) data. Safe-haven demand continues to provide some support for the precious metal, balancing out the strength of the USD.

The anticipation surrounding the US CPI report is keeping traders on edge, as a higher-than-expected inflation reading could drive further USD strength, potentially weighing on gold prices. The market is closely watching the release, with traders bracing for any shifts in market sentiment that could impact the gold-to-USD exchange rate. Gold's ability to hold its ground near current levels highlights its role as a hedge against inflation, even amid ongoing USD momentum.

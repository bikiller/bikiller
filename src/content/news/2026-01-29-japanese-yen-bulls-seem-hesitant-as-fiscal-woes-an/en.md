The Japanese Yen (JPY) showed resilience against the weaker US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Thursday, with the USD/JPY exchange rate fluctuating around 110.50. However, bullish momentum remains subdued as investors grapple with Japan's fiscal challenges and ongoing political uncertainty. The Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish stance has yet to translate into significant currency strength, leaving traders cautious.

Market sentiment reflects a complex interplay between economic fundamentals and geopolitical factors, causing hesitation among Yen bulls. While the USD struggles against the JPY, the Euro (EUR) also finds itself in a tight range, with EUR/JPY hovering around 130.75. As traders await clearer signals, the JPY's performance may hinge on upcoming economic data and developments in Japan's political landscape.

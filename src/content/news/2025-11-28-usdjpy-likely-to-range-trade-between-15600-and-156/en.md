The USD/JPY currency pair is expected to trade in a range between 156.00 and 156.75, reflecting a period of sideways movement. Analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, highlight a soft underlying tone in the market, which suggests potential downward pressure on the USD in the longer term. 

Should the dollar decline, it is anticipated to fall within a lower range of 155.05 to 157.05. This outlook indicates a cautious sentiment among traders, as fluctuations in economic data could influence the exchange rate dynamics for USD/JPY in the coming sessions.

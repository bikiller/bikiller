Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a notable pullback after reaching an all-time high of $120.46. As trading resumed during the European session on Thursday, the exchange rate settled around $116.60 per troy ounce, reflecting a significant decline from its peak. This retreat highlights the volatility in the precious metals market, influenced by fluctuations in global demand and investor sentiment.

The recent surge to record levels was fueled by a mix of factors, including inflation concerns and a weakening USD, which typically boosts the appeal of silver as a safe-haven asset. However, profit-taking and market corrections often follow such highs, prompting traders to reassess their positions. As the market stabilizes, analysts will closely monitor technical levels and economic indicators that may impact future price movements in the silver market.

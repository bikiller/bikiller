The USD/INR pair lost ground on Tuesday, reversing two days of gains as the Indian Rupee strengthened. The INR's rally was supported by positive equity inflows and a boost from recent trade deals, which lifted investor sentiment. The exchange rate for USD/INR dropped below 82.00, marking a key technical shift for the pair, signaling potential further pressure on the US Dollar.

Despite the Rupee's rise, the Indian currency faced challenges in the previous session. Bankers noted hedging activities and routine local flows as factors limiting INR's gains. The USD/INR saw fluctuating volatility, with the exchange rate testing levels around 82.25 before stabilizing. The ongoing market dynamics underscore the influence of global trade conditions and capital inflows on emerging market currencies like the INR.

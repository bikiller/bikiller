The GBP/JPY currency pair faces downward pressure for the second consecutive day, slipping closer to its recent swing low during the early European session on Tuesday. The exchange rate hovers just above the mid-212.00s, remaining within a narrow range that has held for the past week. Despite the retreat, spot prices are still confined to this established trading range, showing limited volatility in the short term.

The market sentiment is influenced by growing speculation surrounding a potential Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike, which has added pressure on the yen. Meanwhile, political uncertainty in the UK continues to weigh on the pound. As traders monitor these factors, GBP/JPY remains sensitive to developments in both economies, with the BoJ's policy stance and UK political turmoil remaining key drivers of price action.

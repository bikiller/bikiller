GBP/USD advanced by 0.59% on Tuesday, buoyed by a general weakening of the US Dollar. With limited economic data emerging from the UK, traders are keeping a close eye on the upcoming UK Autumn budget release. The currency pair is currently trading at 1.3181, nearing the significant 1.3200 level.

The decline in USD support reflects broader market sentiment, as investors reassess economic indicators ahead of critical data releases. As GBP/USD moves higher, the exchange rate's proximity to the 1.3200 milestone could signal potential bullish momentum, making it essential for traders to monitor upcoming developments closely.

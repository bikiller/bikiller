The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback against six major currencies, is trading 0.15% lower at approximately 99.20 during the European session on Friday. This decline follows a retreat from the six-week high of 99.50 reached the previous day, as traders adjust their positions ahead of the extended weekend in the United States.

Despite the current pullback, a bullish crossover between the 20 and 50-day Exponential Moving Averages suggests potential for further upside in the DXY.

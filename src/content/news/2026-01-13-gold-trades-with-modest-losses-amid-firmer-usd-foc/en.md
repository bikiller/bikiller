Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing modest losses during the early European trading session, driven by a firmer US dollar. As traders assess the current exchange rate, gold is showing signs of weakness, but its decline remains limited by a supportive fundamental backdrop. The currency pair is navigating through these fluctuations with investors closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators.

Market sentiment is largely influenced by anticipation surrounding the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to provide insight into inflation trends and potential monetary policy shifts. As the USD strengthens, the interplay between the dollar and gold highlights the ongoing volatility in the forex market, with traders adjusting their positions based on the latest economic data. The focus now remains on how the CPI figures will impact market dynamics and the future trajectory of both the gold and USD.

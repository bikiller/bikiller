The EUR/GBP currency pair has seen a decline, trading around 0.8745 in the early European session on Monday. This movement comes as traders position themselves ahead of the upcoming UK GDP release, which could significantly influence the exchange rate. The softness observed below the key level of 0.8750 suggests a cautious sentiment among market participants.

As the market anticipates the GDP data, any surprises could trigger further volatility in the EUR/GBP exchange rate. This currency pair's performance may also reflect broader trends in the forex market, particularly in relation to the EUR and GBP dynamics against the USD. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as they may impact future trading strategies and currency valuations.

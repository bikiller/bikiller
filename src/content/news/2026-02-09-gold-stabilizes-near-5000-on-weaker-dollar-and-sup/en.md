Gold (XAU/USD) is holding steady around $5,010 on Monday, recovering after last week's volatility. The precious metal is benefiting from a weaker U.S. Dollar, with the exchange rate up nearly 1.15% on the day. The intraday high of $5,047 reflects ongoing support from favorable market fundamentals, fueling continued demand for gold.

The USD's weakness remains a key driver in gold's price action, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainties. As XAU/USD remains above the $5,000 level, traders are watching for potential shifts in the broader currency markets, particularly with any developments in the EUR/USD and USD-related pairs that could influence risk sentiment.

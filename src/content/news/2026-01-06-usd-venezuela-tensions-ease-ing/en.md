In the aftermath of the recent US military operation in Venezuela, the currency market has shown remarkable resilience, with minimal impact on trading activities. The exchange rate of the USD remains stable against major currencies, maintaining its strength amid geopolitical tensions. Analysts note that the USD/EUR pair continues to hover around 1.05, reflecting a cautious market sentiment but overall stability.

The easing of tensions has allowed traders to refocus on other economic indicators and data releases. As the market digests the latest developments, the USD remains a safe haven, while the EUR struggles to gain traction. With the USD index holding firm, any significant fluctuations in the next trading sessions will largely depend on upcoming economic reports and further geopolitical developments.

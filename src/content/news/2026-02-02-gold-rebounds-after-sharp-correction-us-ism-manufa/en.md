Gold (XAU/USD) found stability on Monday after a sharp correction that followed last week's rally to new all-time highs near $5,600. The precious metal recovered from an intraday slide of nearly 10%, which brought it to over three-week lows near $4,402. As of now, XAU/USD is trading around $4,705, showing signs of stabilization amid dip-buying interest.

The market remains cautious as traders await the release of the US ISM Manufacturing PMI, a key economic indicator that could influence the broader market sentiment. The sharp correction in gold prices reflects a volatile trading environment, driven in part by fluctuating demand for the USD. Gold's near-term movement could hinge on the data, potentially adding volatility to the XAU/USD exchange rate.

EUR/USD is experiencing a rebound, rising toward 1.1650 after four consecutive days of losses. As the currency pair trades around 1.1630 during the Asian session on Monday, traders are closely monitoring market dynamics. Despite this uptick, the exchange rate may face resistance due to heightened safe-haven demand linked to the growing uncertainties surrounding the US-Greenland situation.

The evolving geopolitical landscape has increased risk aversion among investors, prompting a shift toward safer assets. Consequently, while EUR/USD is attempting to recover, the potential for sustained upward momentum could be limited as traders weigh the implications of global tensions on the broader market. This cautious sentiment underscores the fragility of the current gains in the currency pair.

The Pound Sterling rebounded during the North American session, buoyed by a stronger-than-expected Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report for September. The data indicated that the U.S. economy added more jobs than anticipated, prompting traders to adjust their outlook on the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. As a result, the GBP/USD exchange rate climbed to 1.3117 after hitting a daily low of 1.3037.

This positive movement in the GBP/USD currency pair reflects growing hopes for potential Fed rate cuts, as investors interpret the robust job growth as a signal for a shift in monetary policy. With the trading dynamics influenced by the NFP data, market participants are closely monitoring the implications for the USD, as any alteration in Fed strategy could further impact the exchange rate in the coming sessions.

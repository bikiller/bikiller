The AUD/USD exchange rate has been supported by strong labour data from January, keeping the prospect of further rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in focus. The Australian dollar has shown resilience, rising steadily against the USD, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions. This data reinforces expectations that the RBA may take a more hawkish stance, adding to the bullish sentiment in the currency pair.

As the AUD/USD continues to climb, traders are paying close attention to any shifts in global risk sentiment. The combination of solid domestic economic figures and the Federal Reserve's ongoing tightening cycle has bolstered the Australian dollar's appeal. However, broader market volatility could limit further significant gains, with geopolitical risks remaining a potential drag on the pair's performance in the near term.

The January FOMC minutes revealed that the New York Fed had examined USD/JPY exchange rates for the US Treasury, which has contributed to growing market expectations that Washington may be more comfortable with a weaker US Dollar. This insight strengthens perceptions that the Federal Reserve is on a cautious path toward easing, signaling potential future weakness for the USD.

Market reaction has been notable, with USD/JPY holding steady near key levels, reinforcing the view that the Fed is not in a rush to tighten policy. The broader implications for currency pairs like EUR/USD also suggest that traders may be pricing in slower-than-expected interest rate hikes, maintaining pressure on the Dollar. This could offer some support to the EUR and other majors in the near term, as USD softness prevails.

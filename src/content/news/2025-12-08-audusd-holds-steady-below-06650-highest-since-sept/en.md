The AUD/USD pair is currently trading in a bullish consolidation phase, holding steady below the significant resistance level of 0.6650. This marks its highest point since September 16, which was reached on Friday. The exchange rate's stability suggests a period of trading calm as investors await upcoming economic indicators, particularly China's trade data, which could influence market sentiment.

As the market digests this data, fluctuations in the currency pair could arise, reflecting changes in risk appetite and global economic conditions. The AUD's resilience against the USD highlights ongoing interest in Australian assets, but the upcoming figures from China could play a crucial role in determining the direction of the exchange rate in the near term. Traders are poised to react as the week's developments unfold.

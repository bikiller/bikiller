The Pound Sterling (GBP) is trading lower against its major counterparts on Tuesday, reflecting a decline as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer advocates for reduced interest rates. This stance is aimed at curbing inflation and stimulating business investment to foster economic growth. As a result, the GBP/USD exchange rate shows a slight dip, influencing trading sentiment across the board.

Market reactions are evident as investors assess the implications of Starmer's comments on future monetary policy. The euro has also felt the pressure, with the GBP/EUR pair reflecting a downward trend. Analysts suggest that if interest rates are lowered, it could lead to a weaker Pound, impacting its attractiveness to forex traders and investors alike.

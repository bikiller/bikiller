AUD/USD saw a data-heavy second half of the week following the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) minutes released on Tuesday. The minutes revealed that while the RBA deemed its recent rate hike necessary, future rate decisions will hinge on incoming data and the shifting risk balance. Traders are closely watching how these developments will impact the Australian dollar's trajectory against the USD.

The RBA's cautious stance kept the Australian dollar under pressure, with AUD/USD holding near technical levels. Market participants are now turning their attention to upcoming economic reports, which could determine the pair's next move. Any stronger-than-expected data could fuel further Australian dollar strength, while weak figures may prompt a reversal in AUD/USD.

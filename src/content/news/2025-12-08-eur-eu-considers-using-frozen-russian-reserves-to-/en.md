The euro (EUR) is under pressure as the European Union explores the possibility of utilizing frozen Russian reserves to provide crucial financial support to Ukraine. With the U.S. halting its aid, the European bloc is stepping in as Ukraine's funds are projected to be depleted by April, creating uncertainty in the market. This has implications for the EUR/USD exchange rate, which could be affected by any shifts in sentiment surrounding EU support for Ukraine.

As traders react to these developments, the EUR/USD pair may experience heightened volatility. Analysts are closely monitoring key technical levels, with resistance forming around 1.10 and support at approximately 1.08. The decision to tap into Russian reserves could influence investor confidence and, in turn, impact trading strategies as the market weighs the effectiveness of EU intervention amid geopolitical tensions.

The EUR/GBP currency pair is facing downward pressure, dipping below the 0.8750 level during the early European session on Friday. The pair has dropped to approximately 0.8735 as the British Pound (GBP) strengthens against the Euro (EUR). This move comes in the wake of stronger-than-expected UK retail sales data, which provided a boost to GBP.

The UK's economic figures exceeded forecasts, causing a shift in market sentiment and favoring the Pound. Traders responded to the upbeat data, pushing the EUR/GBP exchange rate lower. The decline in the pair highlights the market's sensitivity to economic reports, with the UK retail sales figures playing a key role in driving the recent GBP rally.

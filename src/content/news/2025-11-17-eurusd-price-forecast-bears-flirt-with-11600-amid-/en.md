The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing downward pressure for the second consecutive day, trading near the critical level of 1.1600. This bearish trend is largely attributed to the strengthening US Dollar (USD), which has gained traction as market expectations for another rate cut by the US Federal Reserve (Fed) diminish. As a result, traders are closely monitoring how these dynamics affect the exchange rate.

The recent shift in sentiment has sparked concerns among EUR bulls, as the USD's resilience may lead to further declines in the EUR/USD pair. With the exchange rate hovering around 1.1600, market participants are likely to keep a watchful eye on upcoming economic indicators that could influence Fed policy and, subsequently, the direction of this key currency pair.

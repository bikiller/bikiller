Gold (XAU/USD) surged past the $5,000 mark on Monday, marking a new milestone in its historic rally. The precious metal’s price surge comes amid escalating geopolitical tensions and growing economic uncertainty, prompting investors to flock to safe-haven assets. Gold's breakout above the psychological $5,000 level highlights a shift in investor sentiment, with demand for traditional stores of value increasing as global risks intensify.

The move comes as the U.S. dollar (USD) faces pressure, with the EUR/USD exchange rate reflecting broader market concerns. As gold continues to outperform other assets, traders are closely monitoring technical levels, with further gains expected if geopolitical risks continue to drive market sentiment. The shift towards gold could have wider implications for the forex market, influencing the strength of the USD against major currencies like the euro and yen.

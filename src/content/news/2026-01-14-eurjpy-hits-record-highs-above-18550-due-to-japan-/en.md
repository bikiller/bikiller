The EUR/JPY currency pair continues its impressive surge, marking its fourth consecutive day of gains by reaching new all-time highs above 185.50. During the early European trading session on Wednesday, the exchange rate hovered around 185.40, driven by ongoing fiscal concerns surrounding Japan's economic policies.

This upward momentum reflects growing investor sentiment as market participants weigh the implications of Japan's fiscal strategies. As the EUR strengthens against the JPY, traders are closely monitoring how these developments will impact future exchange rates, particularly in relation to other major currencies like USD and EUR.

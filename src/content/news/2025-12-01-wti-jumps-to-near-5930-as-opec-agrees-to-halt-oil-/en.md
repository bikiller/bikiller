West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures on the NYMEX surged 1.7% to around $59.30 during the Asian trading session on Monday. The rally came as OPEC+ reached an agreement to halt oil supply increases through the first quarter of 2026. This decision has sparked significant buying interest in the market, driving prices higher and impacting related currency pairs.

The rise in WTI prices is likely to influence the USD against other currencies, particularly the EUR, as fluctuations in oil prices often affect inflation and interest rate expectations. Traders will closely monitor market reactions to this development, as a sustained increase in oil prices could alter exchange rates and overall market sentiment in the coming weeks.

The British Pound (GBP) remains under pressure as traders await clarity on the Bank of England's (BoE) next rate move. Societe Generale notes that the timing of a potential rate cut is still uncertain, though market expectations suggest it could be on the horizon. The BoE is likely to emphasize that inflation is set to decrease towards the target in the near term, offering some relief to GBP/USD.

Currently, the GBP/USD exchange rate hovers around 1.2300, with resistance at 1.2400. Traders are closely monitoring any hints from the BoE regarding the potential for a rate cut, which could influence the Pound’s performance against the Euro (EUR) and US Dollar (USD). The uncertainty surrounding the rate decision leaves the currency vulnerable to fluctuations in global risk sentiment and economic data.

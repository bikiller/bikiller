The US Dollar (USD) struggled to maintain its footing on Thursday as it faced renewed selling pressure after disappointing employment figures. Initial Jobless Claims for the week ending December 6 surged to 236,000, significantly higher than the forecast of 192,000. This unexpected rise weighed heavily on the USD, causing declines across major currency pairs.

As the market digested the employment data, trading in the USD fell against the Euro (EUR), pushing the EUR/USD exchange rate higher.

With the dollar under pressure, traders are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators for further guidance on potential shifts in currency dynamics.

In a significant move impacting the global oil market and forex trading, U.S. President Donald Trump has ordered a total blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. This decision, reported late Tuesday by Reuters, is expected to exacerbate existing tensions and influence the exchange rates of currencies closely tied to oil prices, particularly the USD.

The blockade could lead to heightened volatility in the USD/Venezuelan bolívar currency pair as traders react to the implications for Venezuelan oil exports, which have already been severely restricted. With oil prices likely to fluctuate amid geopolitical uncertainties, other pairs such as EUR/USD may also experience shifts as investors reassess risk and adjust their trading strategies in light of these developments.

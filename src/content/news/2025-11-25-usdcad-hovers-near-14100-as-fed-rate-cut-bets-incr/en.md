The USD/CAD currency pair remains steady around the 1.4110 mark during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, following gains in the previous day. The exchange rate reflects heightened market sentiment surrounding the possibility of Federal Reserve rate cuts, which have influenced trader expectations and positioning.

Weaker oil prices are also weighing on the Canadian dollar, contributing to the currency pair’s current levels. As oil remains a significant driver of the Canadian economy, any decline in prices tends to weaken the CAD against the USD, reinforcing the upward pressure on the exchange rate. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments as they assess potential trading strategies in the days ahead.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) showed slight resilience against the U.S. Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Friday, inching higher yet remaining near its lowest exchange rate since mid-January. On Thursday, the currency pair touched a critical low, reflecting ongoing market concerns despite the recent National Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and warnings about potential intervention.

Market bulls appear unphased by the CPI figures, which failed to bolster the Yen's strength significantly. As traders assess the implications of ongoing economic conditions, the JPY's vulnerability raises questions about its future trajectory in a market influenced by global sentiment and central bank policies. Investors will remain vigilant for any signs of intervention from the Bank of Japan as the currency continues to grapple with a fluctuating exchange rate.

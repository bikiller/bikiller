Chinese silver stocks have plummeted to their lowest levels in a decade, with warehouse inventories falling to their lowest since 2015. This sharp decline is largely attributed to record exports and a tightening supply in the physical market. As a result, the Shanghai silver market is now experiencing backwardation, a condition where the spot price exceeds future prices, indicating strong demand amid limited availability.

This shift in the silver market may have broader implications for forex trading, particularly affecting currency pairs like USD/CNY and EUR/CNY. As silver becomes increasingly scarce, traders may adjust their positions, influencing exchange rates and market sentiment. The situation underscores the importance of monitoring commodity inventories, as they can drive significant movements in currency valuations and investment strategies.

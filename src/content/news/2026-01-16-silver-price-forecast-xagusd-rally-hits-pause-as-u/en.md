Silver prices (XAG/USD) have declined over 2% to approximately $90.40 during the Asian trading session on Friday, marking a pause in its recent rally. This follows a remarkable surge that saw the white metal reach an all-time high of nearly $93.90 on Wednesday. The pullback comes as traders react to the U.S. government's announcement to forgo tariffs on critical minerals, which may influence future supply dynamics.

The decision by the U.S. has sparked concerns about silver's upward momentum, as it dampens the perceived scarcity that often drives prices higher. As investors reassess their strategies in light of this news, the currency pair's exchange rate reflects the shifting market sentiment. With the potential for further fluctuations in the coming days, market participants will be closely watching silver's price action for signs of renewed strength or continued weakness.

The Canadian Dollar extended its bullish momentum, driving USD/CAD into its third consecutive bearish session. Trading well below key technical levels, the pair is under significant downside pressure. The exchange rate currently sits well beneath the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at 1.3757, with further resistance at the 200-day EMA at 1.3854. This suggests a prolonged bearish outlook for the pair.

The continued strength of the Canadian Dollar reflects a mix of factors, including rising oil prices, which support Canada's economy, and a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. With USD/CAD struggling below critical moving averages, traders are closely watching for a potential further decline in the exchange rate. Failure to recover above these levels may signal additional weakness for the USD in the near term.

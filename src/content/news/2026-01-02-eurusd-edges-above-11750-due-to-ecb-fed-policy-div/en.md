EUR/USD has seen a modest rebound, trading above 1.1750, currently around 1.1760 during the Asian session on Friday. This recovery follows recent losses, driven by a divergence in monetary policy between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Federal Reserve (Fed). As the market digests these contrasting stances, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate for further movements.

In addition to central bank policies, market participants are keenly awaiting the release of Germany’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data later today. This report may provide insight into the health of the Eurozone's manufacturing sector, potentially influencing the EUR/USD currency pair's trajectory. With the current trading momentum, the upcoming data could lead to further fluctuations in the exchange rate as traders react to the implications for both the euro and the dollar.

The AUD/USD pair surged to a fresh three-year high above the 0.7100 level during the Asian session on Wednesday, recovering from a slight dip the previous day. The pair's climb was fueled by renewed demand for the Australian dollar as traders adjusted their positions ahead of key economic data releases, including the upcoming US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report.

As the exchange rate of AUD/USD surpassed 0.7100, the move signals growing bullish sentiment towards the Australian dollar, bolstered by stable commodity prices and expectations of global economic growth. This uptick in the currency pair comes amid a broader weakening of the USD, which has been under pressure in recent trading sessions. With the NFP data on the horizon, the AUD/USD pair may see continued volatility, potentially testing higher levels in the short term.

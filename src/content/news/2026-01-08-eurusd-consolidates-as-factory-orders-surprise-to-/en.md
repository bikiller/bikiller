The Euro (EUR) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) as it enters Thursday's North American trading session, maintaining a stable exchange rate within the flat range established since June. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, this consolidation follows a recent pullback, reflecting market participants' cautious stance.

The unexpected upside in factory orders has added a layer of complexity to the EUR/USD dynamics, suggesting potential shifts in economic sentiment. Traders will be watching closely for any further developments that could influence this currency pair, as its current trading range continues to shape expectations for future movements in the forex market.

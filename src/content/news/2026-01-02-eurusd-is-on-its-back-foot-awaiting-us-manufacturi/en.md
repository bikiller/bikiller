EUR/USD is experiencing a downward trend, trading around 1.1720 during the European session. This marks a significant decline from its recent highs above 1.1800 in late December. The currency pair is bracing for the release of the US Manufacturing PMI data, which is expected to influence the market sentiment further.

As traders anticipate the upcoming economic indicators, the exchange rate reflects concerns over potential shifts in the USD's strength. The market's focus on US manufacturing activity could lead to increased volatility, impacting the EUR/USD dynamics as investors reassess their positions ahead of the data release. The current trading environment suggests cautious sentiment among forex participants.

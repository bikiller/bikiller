The GBP/USD exchange rate slipped during the North American trading session as markets experienced thin liquidity due to the closure of US markets for President’s Day. At the time of writing, the pair is trading at 1.3635, down 0.12%, reflecting the subdued market conditions. The lack of major economic catalysts in the US left traders cautious, resulting in muted movements.

Traders are now focusing on upcoming data from the UK, particularly the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which could provide further direction for the Pound. The currency pair's recent price action suggests that investors are awaiting fresh insights into inflation and economic conditions in the UK. The thin trading environment makes the GBP/USD more susceptible to volatility as traders adjust their positions ahead of key data releases.

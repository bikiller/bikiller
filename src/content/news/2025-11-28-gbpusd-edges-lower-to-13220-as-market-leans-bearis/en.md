GBP/USD experienced a slight decline during the North American session on Friday, trading at 1.3221 after reaching a daily peak of 1.3244. The currency pair, which had gained nearly 1% throughout the week, is now under pressure as traders react to the recent Autumn Budget.

This bearish sentiment in the market reflects a broader response to fiscal policies and economic forecasts presented in the budget.

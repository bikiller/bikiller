The Indian Rupee (INR) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) during Thursday's trading, following a steady opening. The USD/INR currency pair fell to approximately 90.50, driven by growing speculation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may step in to bolster the rupee's value. This move reflects broader market confidence in the RBI's ability to manage currency stability.

As traders monitor these developments, the decline in the USD/INR exchange rate underscores the potential for further interventions by the RBI. Such actions could influence trading patterns and impact investor sentiment towards the INR, as market participants weigh the implications of RBI policy on future currency movements.

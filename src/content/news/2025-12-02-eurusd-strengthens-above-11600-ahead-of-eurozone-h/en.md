The EUR/USD currency pair has gained momentum, trading above the 1.1600 mark and reaching approximately 1.1615 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This upward movement comes as the US Dollar continues to weaken against the Euro, driven by disappointing US Manufacturing PMI data that raises expectations for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month.

As traders react to the economic signals, the exchange rate reflects growing confidence in the Eurozone amid concerns over the US economic outlook. The pressure on the USD could lead to increased volatility in the currency pair, with market participants closely monitoring upcoming Eurozone HICP data for further insights into inflation trends and their potential impact on monetary policy.

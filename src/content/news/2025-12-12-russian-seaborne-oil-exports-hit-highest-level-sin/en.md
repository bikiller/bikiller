Russian seaborne crude oil exports have reached their highest level since early 2022, as reported by Commerzbank. This surge in exports indicates a notable increase in market activity, yet a significant portion of these shipments are reportedly unsold and are being stored offshore. The implications for the global oil market and related currency pairs, particularly USD/RUB, could lead to increased volatility as traders assess future demand and pricing dynamics.

As oil prices fluctuate, the EUR/USD exchange rate may also feel the impact of these developments, particularly if Russian supply influences broader market sentiment. The current trading environment suggests that market participants should closely monitor the situation, as the unsold oil inventory could signal a shift in economic conditions, potentially affecting both the oil market and currency valuations in the coming weeks.

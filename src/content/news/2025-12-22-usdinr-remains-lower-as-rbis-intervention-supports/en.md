The Indian Rupee (INR) continues to strengthen against the US Dollar (USD) at the beginning of the week, maintaining last week's gains. The USD/INR currency pair is trading around the 90.00 level, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) playing a crucial role in this movement. The RBI's intervention in both the spot and non-deliverable forward (NDF) markets has effectively supported the Rupee, helping to curb its volatility.

Market analysts note that this intervention underscores the RBI's commitment to stabilizing the exchange rate. As the USD/INR pair faces downward pressure, traders are closely monitoring potential further actions from the central bank that could influence future trading dynamics. The ongoing support for the INR may lead to increased confidence in the currency, impacting overall market sentiment in the region.

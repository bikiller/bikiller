The Indian Rupee (INR) has gained momentum following news of a potential US-India trade deal, with the USD/INR pair trading at 82.60. Market sentiment has improved as traders anticipate the deal could bolster economic ties between the two nations. However, OCBC Bank warns that the lack of specific details may cause caution among investors, limiting further upside for the INR in the near term.

Despite the positive outlook, technical analysis shows resistance around the 82.50 level for USD/INR, with potential volatility in the coming days. As traders shift focus back to fundamentals, uncertainties surrounding global trade and economic conditions could reignite risk-off sentiment, possibly weighing on the INR. For now, the market remains sensitive to any updates on the trade deal's progress.

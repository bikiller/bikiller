The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to experience significant selling pressure, as traders remain focused on the USD/JPY currency pair, which has surged past the mid-155.00s during the early European session. This movement is primarily driven by a noticeable increase in demand for the US Dollar (USD), positioning the exchange rate towards the critical level of 156.00 ahead of the upcoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy meeting.

As market participants brace for potential insights from the BoJ, the prevailing trend suggests a continued bearish sentiment for the Yen. This could further bolster the USD/JPY pair, especially if the US economic data continues to underpin the strength of the dollar. With volatility expected, traders are closely monitoring these developments to assess future trading opportunities in this key currency pair.

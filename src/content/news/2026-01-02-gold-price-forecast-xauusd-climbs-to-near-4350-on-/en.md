Gold (XAU/USD) surged to nearly $4,345 in early Asian trading on Friday, buoyed by increasing bets on potential Federal Reserve rate cuts and heightened geopolitical tensions. The precious metal has seen a remarkable resurgence, finishing 2025 with a staggering annual gain of approximately 65%, marking its most significant yearly increase since 1979.

This bullish trend in gold reflects a broader shift in market sentiment, as traders seek safe-haven assets amidst uncertainty. The movements in the XAU/USD exchange rate indicate a growing demand for gold, particularly as the dollar (USD) faces pressure. As geopolitical risks persist, investors may continue to turn to gold as a hedge, signaling potential volatility in both the currency and commodities markets.

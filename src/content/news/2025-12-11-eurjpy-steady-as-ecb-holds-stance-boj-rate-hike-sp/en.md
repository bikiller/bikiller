EUR/JPY remains steady at 182.40 as the European Central Bank (ECB) maintains its current monetary policy, creating a stable environment for the currency pair. The lack of immediate changes from the ECB allows traders to focus on other factors influencing the exchange rate, particularly the evolving economic landscape in Europe.

Meanwhile, speculation around a potential rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is gaining traction, adding a layer of complexity to the market dynamics. As expectations for tightening measures in Japan increase, traders are keenly observing how this will affect the broader forex market, especially in relation to the USD's performance against the EUR. The balance of these factors keeps EUR/JPY in a tight trading range as investors await further developments.

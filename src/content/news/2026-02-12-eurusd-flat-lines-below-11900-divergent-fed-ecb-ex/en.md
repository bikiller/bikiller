The EUR/USD currency pair remained flat below the 1.1900 mark during Thursday’s Asian session, struggling to build on the previous day’s bounce from the 1.1835-1.1830 support region. The exchange rate showed little momentum, fluctuating in a narrow range, as traders awaited further developments.

The divergence in monetary policy expectations between the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank continues to provide underlying support for the euro. While the Fed signals a potential tightening of policy, the ECB remains cautious, leading to contrasting market outlooks. This disparity in central bank strategies is expected to influence the EUR/USD's trading sentiment in the near term.

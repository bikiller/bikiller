EUR/JPY continued its downward trend on Monday, trading around 179.40, following a pullback from its record high of 179.97 achieved in the previous session. This marks the second consecutive day of losses for the currency pair, reflecting market reactions to Japan's preliminary Q3 GDP data, which, while less disappointing, still fell short of bullish expectations.

Gold (XAU/USD) surged to a new high of $4,330 on Wednesday, reflecting a 0.87% increase. This rally was triggered by a mixed US jobs report released on Tuesday, which fueled concerns about the economy. Additionally, rising tensions between the US and Venezuela added to the demand for safe-haven assets as traders sought refuge amid geopolitical uncertainties.

The comments made by Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller further contributed to the market's volatility, as investors reassess the potential impact of monetary policy on the USD exchange rate. As the situation unfolds, the interplay of economic data and geopolitical factors will likely continue to influence gold prices, as well as other currency pairs in the forex market, creating potential trading opportunities for market participants.

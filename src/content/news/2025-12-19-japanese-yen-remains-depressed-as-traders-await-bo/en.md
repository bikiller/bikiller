The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle following recent losses attributed to the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) policies. As traders anticipate insights from BoJ Governor Ueda's upcoming press conference, the USD/JPY currency pair remains firm, trading above the 156.00 level, marking its highest point in over a week. 

This sustained strength in the USD can be linked to a broader appreciation against other major currencies, which has further pressured the Yen. Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics as they assess potential shifts in monetary policy that could impact future trading strategies.

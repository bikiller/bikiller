Oil prices continued their downward trend on Friday, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) slipping below $58.00 for the first time since late October. This marks the third consecutive day of declines as traders react to developments surrounding ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. The market sentiment is heavily influenced by the potential for a resolution, which could have significant implications for global energy supply and demand.

The weakening of WTI is contributing to fluctuations in the forex market, particularly against the backdrop of the USD. With oil prices falling, the US dollar may face increased pressure against major currencies like the EUR as traders reassess economic forecasts. As the situation develops, the exchange rate dynamics between these currencies will be closely watched, especially if a peace deal leads to a stabilization of energy prices.

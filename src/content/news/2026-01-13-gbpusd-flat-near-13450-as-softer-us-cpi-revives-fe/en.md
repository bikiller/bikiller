The British Pound (GBP) is showing slight weakness against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, trading at 1.3450, down 0.03%. This movement comes in the wake of a softer US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which has reignited speculation around potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve as early as 2026. As traders digest the implications of the inflation data, GBP/USD remains close to its opening levels.

The current exchange rate reflects a cautious market sentiment as investors weigh the effects of U.S. monetary policy on the global economy. The potential for the Fed to ease its policy stance has put pressure on the USD, while the GBP struggles to gain traction. Moving forward, traders will closely monitor upcoming economic indicators and central bank statements that could influence the currency pair's trajectory.

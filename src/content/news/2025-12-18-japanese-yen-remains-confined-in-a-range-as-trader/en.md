The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to trade within a narrow range as the market anticipates the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) rate decision scheduled for Friday. During Thursday's Asian session, the JPY displayed a consolidative pattern, with traders choosing to remain cautious ahead of this pivotal central bank meeting. Currently, the USD/JPY exchange rate hovers around 110.50, reflecting a lack of significant movement.

As traders await guidance from the BoJ, the Euro remains steady against the Yen, with the EUR/JPY pair trading near 130.50. Market sentiment is influenced by expectations surrounding the BoJ's monetary policy direction, which could have substantial implications for currency valuations. With low volatility prevailing, investors are positioned for potential shifts in the exchange rates following the central bank's announcement.

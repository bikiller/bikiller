The EUR/USD currency pair is currently trading in a narrow range around the 1.1650 level, reflecting a stable yet cautious sentiment in the market. This flat performance comes as traders await crucial economic indicators, including US Retail Sales and the Producer Price Index (PPI) data, which could significantly influence the exchange rate.

Market participants are closely monitoring these upcoming reports for insights into the strength of the USD. A stronger-than-expected showing in US economic data could lead to a further decline in the EUR/USD exchange rate, potentially testing the monthly lows. Conversely, disappointing data may provide the Euro with some much-needed support against the dollar, keeping the trading range intact.

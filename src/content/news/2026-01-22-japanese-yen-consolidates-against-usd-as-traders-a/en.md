As the Asian trading session unfolds, the exchange rate remains sensitive to developments surrounding the upcoming BoJ meeting. Analysts speculate that any shift in interest rates or guidance from the central bank could lead to increased volatility in the currency pair. With the market poised for potential movement, traders are closely monitoring key technical levels that could influence future price action.

Gold prices in India experienced a decline on Friday, reflecting broader market trends influenced by fluctuations in the USD and investor sentiment. According to FXStreet data, the precious metal's price retreated as traders reacted to shifting economic indicators, particularly in relation to the USD's strength against major currency pairs like EUR/USD. 

As the exchange rate dynamics shifted, the drop in gold prices could signal a potential shift in trading strategies among investors. Market analysts suggest that ongoing geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns may continue to impact gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset, prompting traders to closely monitor upcoming economic data releases for further direction.

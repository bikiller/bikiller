The Japanese Yen (JPY) showed resilience against the US Dollar (USD) during Friday's Asian session, maintaining a stable exchange rate amid rising concerns over Japan's fiscal health. Despite this stability, the upside potential for the Yen appears limited, as market participants remain wary of the implications of ongoing government intervention.

As traders monitor the USD/JPY pair, the currency's strength faces headwinds from Japan's ailing economy, which could constrain any significant advances. Safe-haven demand continues to support the Yen, but persistent worries about fiscal challenges may cap its gains, suggesting that any upward movement in the exchange rate could be short-lived.

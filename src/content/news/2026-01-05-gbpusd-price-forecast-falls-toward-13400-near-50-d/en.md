The GBP/USD currency pair continues its downward trend, trading around 1.3420 during the Asian session on Monday. This marks the second consecutive day of losses as the exchange rate approaches the critical 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) near the 1.3400 level. Traders are closely monitoring this technical indicator, which may signal further bearish momentum if breached.

Market sentiment remains cautious, influenced by ongoing economic data releases and geopolitical developments. The dollar's strength against the pound reflects broader trends in the forex market, where investors are weighing the implications of potential interest rate changes from the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. As trading progresses, the 1.3400 threshold will be a key level to watch for potential reversals or continued declines in the GBP/USD exchange rate.

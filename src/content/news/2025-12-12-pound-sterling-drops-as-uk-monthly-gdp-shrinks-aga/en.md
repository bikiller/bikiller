The Pound Sterling (GBP) has experienced a notable decline against major currencies following the release of the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for October. The report revealed a contraction of 0.1%, falling short of market expectations for a 0.1% growth. This disappointing data has led to increased selling pressure on GBP, impacting its exchange rates across the board.

As a result, GBP/USD has slipped, reflecting broader concerns about the UK economic outlook. The currency pair now trades below key technical levels, prompting traders to reassess their positions. Similarly, against the Euro (EUR), the GBP has weakened, indicating a loss of investor confidence in the UK economy. The ongoing economic challenges could lead to further volatility in GBP trading as market participants seek clearer signals for potential recovery.

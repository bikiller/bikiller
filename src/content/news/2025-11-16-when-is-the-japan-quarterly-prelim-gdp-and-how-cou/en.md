Japan's Cabinet Office is set to release its preliminary Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the third quarter (Q3) at 23:50 GMT. The market anticipates a contraction of 0.6% quarter-over-quarter, a notable shift from the previous growth of 0.5%. This downturn could significantly impact the USD/JPY currency pair, influencing traders' strategies in the forex market.

A weaker GDP reading may weaken the yen, potentially pushing the USD/JPY exchange rate higher as investors seek safe-haven assets amidst economic uncertainty. Traders will be watching closely, as any deviation from these forecasts could lead to increased volatility in currency trading, especially for those holding positions in both the yen and the U.S. dollar.

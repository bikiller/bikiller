Gold (XAU/USD) surged to nearly $5,000 on Friday, bolstered by softer-than-expected US CPI data. The inflation report stoked expectations that the Federal Reserve may soon implement interest rate cuts, supporting demand for the precious metal. At the time of writing, gold was trading around $5,000, recovering from a near one-week low of $4,880 hit the previous day.

The slight miss in the CPI data weakened the US dollar, fueling further gains for gold. As traders adjusted their positions in anticipation of a shift in Fed policy, the XAU/USD exchange rate saw notable upward momentum. With market sentiment focusing on potential rate cuts, the yellow metal remains an attractive alternative to USD-denominated assets, with its price testing key technical levels near $5,000.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) faced downward pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, following a solid performance where it gained over 0.25% in the previous session. The AUD/USD currency pair demonstrated a subdued trading atmosphere, primarily influenced by the release of the Wage Price Index data for the third quarter, which fell short of expectations and contributed to the weakened exchange rate.

As the market digests the implications of the Federal Reserve's policy outlook, the USD remains steady, maintaining its stronghold against major currencies. The current trading dynamics indicate a cautious sentiment among investors, reflecting uncertainty about future interest rate adjustments. The AUD/USD pair continues to hover around critical technical levels, with traders eyeing upcoming economic indicators for direction.

Rabobank analysts have pointed to a new wave of US-linked investment projects under Japan's expansive trade framework, notably in LNG and oil infrastructure. This move underscores Washington's strategy to direct foreign capital into tangible US assets, shifting focus from traditional stocks and bonds. As these projects unfold, the USD could see upward pressure, with implications for major currency pairs like USD/JPY, potentially boosting the dollar's appeal.

This strategy may influence broader market dynamics, especially with the EUR/USD exchange rate, where US capital flows could create renewed strength in the USD. As foreign investment channels expand, the market will be closely monitoring developments, with technical levels for USD/JPY becoming a critical focus for traders. The shift towards real assets could also impact global oil prices and related commodity currencies, fueling volatility across forex markets.

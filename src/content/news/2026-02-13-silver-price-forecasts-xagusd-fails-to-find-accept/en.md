Silver (XAG/USD) posted slight gains on Friday, trading at $77.35 after recovering from a dip near $74.00 on Thursday. Despite this bounce, the metal is still set to register its third consecutive weekly decline. Bulls have struggled to sustain momentum above the key $79.00 level, highlighting ongoing challenges for the precious metal.

The lack of sustained upside pressure comes as traders remain cautious amid broader market conditions. As silver fails to gain traction above $79.00, the currency pair's performance suggests continued uncertainty in the precious metals market, with the USD exerting influence on XAG/USD. Investors will be watching closely for any shifts in market sentiment or developments that could alter the current trend.

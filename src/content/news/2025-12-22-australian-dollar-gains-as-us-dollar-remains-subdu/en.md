The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, buoyed by the People's Bank of China's (PBOC) decision to maintain its Loan Prime Rates (LPRs) at 3.00% for one-year loans and 3.50% for five-year loans. This stability in China's monetary policy helped to support the AUD in the forex market, as traders reacted positively to the news.

In contrast, the USD remained subdued amid cautious sentiments surrounding the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. This dynamic created a favorable trading environment for the AUD/USD currency pair, allowing the Australian Dollar to gain ground and reflect a more optimistic outlook against a backdrop of steady Chinese economic indicators. Traders will be closely monitoring further developments in both the US and Chinese economies that could impact exchange rates in the coming days.

The EUR/JPY currency pair has softened, trading around 183.65 during the early European session on Monday. This decline is largely attributed to the strengthening of the Japanese Yen as geopolitical tensions in Venezuela escalate, prompting traders to seek safer assets. As a result, the exchange rate has fluctuated, reflecting heightened market sensitivity to global events.

Market participants are also awaiting the release of the Eurozone Sentix Investor Confidence report later today, which could further influence the EUR's performance against the JPY. The ongoing crisis in Venezuela underscores the Yen's appeal as a safe-haven currency, potentially impacting trading strategies as investors weigh geopolitical risks against economic indicators in the Eurozone.

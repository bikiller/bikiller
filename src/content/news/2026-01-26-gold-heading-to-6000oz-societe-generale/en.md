Gold prices have surged past $5,000 per ounce, hitting nearly $5,100, validating the earlier forecast of reaching this milestone by the end of 2026. The strong performance is attributed to ongoing market uncertainty and a weakened USD, which is creating favorable conditions for precious metals. As the global economic landscape remains volatile, investors continue to turn to gold as a safe haven.

Societe Generale has updated its forecast, now predicting that gold could climb to $6,000 per ounce by year-end. This new target may even be conservative, given the current trajectory of gold prices. The movement is likely to influence broader currency pairs, including EUR/USD and GBP/USD, as traders seek to hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations in response to central bank policies.

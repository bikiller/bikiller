GBP/USD is trading flat at approximately 1.3460, reflecting a decline of 0.30% for the day. The currency pair has been consolidating after a strong bullish trend last week, which pushed it to a high of around 1.3535, the highest level in over three months. Traders are currently adopting a cautious stance ahead of the upcoming Fed Minutes.

Meanwhile, the Bank of England's recent signals regarding a careful approach to easing have added to the market's uncertainty. As analysts await further insights from the Fed, fluctuations in the exchange rate may continue, influenced by monetary policy expectations from both the USD and GBP. The current trading environment suggests that GBP/USD could remain range-bound until clearer direction emerges.

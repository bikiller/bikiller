Gold (XAU/USD) remained stable during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, hovering near its all-time high reached earlier. The precious metal has been supported by safe-haven demand as investors seek refuge amid economic uncertainty, countering a slight uptick in the USD. This sideways consolidation reflects mixed market signals, keeping traders on alert.

As the exchange rate for gold stays close to record levels, fluctuations in the USD and broader market dynamics are influencing trading strategies. The current environment suggests that safe-haven assets like gold may continue to attract interest, particularly as geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns persist, potentially impacting the value of major currency pairs like EUR/USD.

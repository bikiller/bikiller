The USD/BRL exchange rate remains under scrutiny as markets factor in the potential direction of Brazil's Selic rate. According to Societe Generale's LatAm strategists, money markets are pricing in a 50 basis point (bp) cut in the Selic rate for March. This reflects expectations that the Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) will take a more dovish approach to monetary policy.

However, Societe Generale's economist, Dev Ashish, expects a more cautious 25 bp reduction, as inflation concerns still weigh heavily on the BCB's decision-making. The divergence in views highlights the ongoing uncertainty in the market, with the final Selic move likely influencing the Brazilian real's performance against the USD in the coming weeks.

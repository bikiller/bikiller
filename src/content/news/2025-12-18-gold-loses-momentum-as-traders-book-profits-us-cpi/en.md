Gold prices (XAU/USD) have slipped below the $4,350 mark during early European trading on Thursday, retreating from recent seven-week highs. This decline is driven by profit-taking among traders, coupled with a strengthening US Dollar (USD), which has shifted the dynamics in the precious metals market.

As the USD rebounds, traders are closely monitoring upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could influence future exchange rates and trading strategies. The current market movements suggest a period of consolidation for gold as investors weigh economic indicators against the backdrop of shifting currency dynamics, particularly in relation to the EUR and other major currencies.

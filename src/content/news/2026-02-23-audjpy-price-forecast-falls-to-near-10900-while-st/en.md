The AUD/JPY currency pair dropped to around 109.05 during the early European session on Monday, moving closer to the 100-day EMA. The Aussie has been pressured by growing concerns over global trade tensions and escalating geopolitical risks in the Middle East. This environment has led to a shift towards safe-haven assets, favoring the Japanese Yen against the Australian Dollar.

Despite the pullback, the bullish bias for AUD/JPY remains intact as it continues to hold above key technical support. The broader market uncertainty is likely to keep volatility elevated, with traders watching for any developments in global trade talks and regional tensions. The outlook for the pair depends on how these external factors evolve and their impact on investor sentiment.

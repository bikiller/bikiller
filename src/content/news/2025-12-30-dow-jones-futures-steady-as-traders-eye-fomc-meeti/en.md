Dow Jones futures dipped 0.02% to hover just below 48,750 during the European session on Tuesday, as traders eagerly await the release of the FOMC Meeting Minutes. Both S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also showed a lack of momentum, declining by 0.04% and 0.05% to around 6,950 and 25,720, respectively. The subdued trading environment can be attributed to thinning volumes as the year-end holidays approach.

The cautious sentiment in equity markets may spill over into the forex market, impacting major currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY. Traders are focused on the upcoming economic indicators and central bank insights that could influence exchange rates. With the holiday season leading to reduced activity, any unexpected market shifts may result in heightened volatility as participants position themselves ahead of potential changes in monetary policy.

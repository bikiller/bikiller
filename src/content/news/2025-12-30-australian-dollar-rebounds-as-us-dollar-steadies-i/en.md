The Australian Dollar (AUD) has shown resilience, inching up against the US Dollar (USD) in thin holiday trading. On Tuesday, the AUD/USD currency pair approached a 14-month high of 0.6727, buoyed by increasing expectations for interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). This momentum reflects a growing confidence in the Australian economy as traders assess the implications of potential monetary policy changes.

As the US Dollar steadies, the AUD's rebound signifies a shift in market sentiment, driven by the anticipated RBA actions. With the exchange rate fluctuating, traders are closely monitoring developments that could impact the Australian dollar's strength against major currencies, including the EUR. The ongoing holiday period may contribute to lighter trading volumes, but the AUD's upward trajectory suggests a bullish outlook for the currency in the near term.

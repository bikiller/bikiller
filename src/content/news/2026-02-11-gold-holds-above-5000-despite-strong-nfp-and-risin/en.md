Gold (XAU/USD) remained resilient above $5,000 on Wednesday, trading at $5,054, up 0.61%. The price held steady despite a stronger-than-expected U.S. non-farm payrolls (NFP) report, which prompted a shift in expectations for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy in the first half of 2026. The robust labor data fueled speculation that the Fed may take a less dovish stance, influencing market sentiment across various assets.

The impact of rising U.S. yields also added pressure on risk assets, but gold continued to attract support as investors sought safety amid market uncertainties. With the XAU/USD holding its ground above $5,000, traders are closely monitoring the interplay between U.S. economic indicators and Fed policy expectations, which could shape future movements in the precious metal. The current price action suggests that gold remains a preferred asset in the face of evolving market dynamics.

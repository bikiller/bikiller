The AUD/USD currency pair is experiencing a solid rally, extending its gains for the second consecutive day. At the time of writing, the pair is trading at approximately 0.7090, marking a 0.93% increase for the day. The Australian dollar’s rise comes amid a hawkish stance from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which continues to support the local currency.

Traders are closely watching the upcoming US jobs data, which could provide fresh direction for the pair. Strong labor market figures may bolster the USD, potentially limiting further upside for the AUD. However, if the data disappoints, the Aussie could maintain its positive momentum, particularly as expectations of higher interest rates from the RBA persist.

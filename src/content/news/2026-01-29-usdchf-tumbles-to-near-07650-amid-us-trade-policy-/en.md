The USD/CHF currency pair saw a significant decline, dropping to approximately 0.7650 during the early European trading session on Thursday. This downward movement is primarily attributed to rising uncertainty surrounding US trade policies, which has spurred concerns among traders about potential impacts on the economy.

Additionally, worries regarding the independence of the Federal Reserve have further fueled selling pressure on the US dollar. As these factors weigh on market sentiment, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate for any signs of stabilization or further decline. The current trading environment highlights the volatility in forex markets as geopolitical and economic uncertainties continue to unfold.

The EUR/JPY currency pair is experiencing bullish momentum, strengthening toward 183.00 after finding support near 182.90 during the early European session on Thursday. The exchange rate has maintained an upward trend, driven by persistent buying interest. Market participants are closely monitoring the 183.00 level, with a potential breakout pointing to further gains.

The ongoing strength of the EUR/JPY cross reflects broader market sentiment favoring the euro, as well as cautious trading in the Japanese yen amid stable global risk appetite. With the bullish tone intact, traders are eyeing key resistance levels, while any pullbacks towards 182.90 may provide opportunities for further long positions.

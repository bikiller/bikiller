The Indian Rupee (INR) remains under pressure on Friday, holding onto its weekly losses against the US Dollar (USD). As the USD/INR currency pair nears its lifetime high, it is trading just shy of the 92.00 level, which was reached on Wednesday. This marks a significant point in the pair’s movement, as the Rupee struggles to regain ground.

The ongoing weakness of the INR reflects broader market dynamics and concerns surrounding India's economic outlook. With the extended weekend approaching in India, traders are keeping a close eye on any potential shifts in sentiment, but the pair’s position near all-time highs signals continued volatility in the short term. Traders will be watching for further developments as the weekend unfolds.

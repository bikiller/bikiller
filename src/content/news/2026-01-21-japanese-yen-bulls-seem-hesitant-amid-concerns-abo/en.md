The Japanese Yen (JPY) is showing strength against the US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, maintaining a slight lead in the currency pair.

As traders assess mixed economic signals, the exchange rate of JPY/USD remains sensitive to developments around Japan's monetary policy. Market participants are closely monitoring technical levels, with a focus on how fiscal stability may influence BoJ's decisions and, consequently, the yen's trajectory in the near term.

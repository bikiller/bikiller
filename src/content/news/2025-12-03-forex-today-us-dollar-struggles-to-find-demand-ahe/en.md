The US Dollar continues to struggle for demand as traders await crucial economic data releases. At the start of trading on December 3, the USD is hovering around 0.92 against the Euro (EUR/USD), reflecting uncertainty in the market. Analysts are closely watching upcoming reports, particularly on employment and inflation, which could significantly influence the USD's exchange rate.

Market participants are particularly focused on the potential implications of these data points for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. A stronger-than-expected jobs report could bolster the USD, while disappointing figures may exacerbate its decline. Currently, trading in major currency pairs remains cautious, with the USD showing mixed performance against its peers as investors weigh the impact of forthcoming economic indicators.

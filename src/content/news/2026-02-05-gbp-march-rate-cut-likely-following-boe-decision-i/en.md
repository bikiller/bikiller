The Bank of England's decision to keep rates at 3.75% has raised expectations for a potential rate cut in March, according to ING. The move follows an analysis in the Bank's Monetary Policy Report, revealing that wage growth is approaching the target inflation rate. This has led markets to speculate that the BoE may ease policy in the coming months.

As traders adjust to the possibility of lower rates, the GBP/USD exchange rate could face downward pressure. A rate cut could weaken the British pound, particularly against the USD and EUR, as investors seek higher yields elsewhere. With markets anticipating more dovish signals from the BoE, volatility in GBP pairs may increase in the near term.

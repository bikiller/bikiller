The USD saw a sharp rise following the resolution of the US government shutdown, boosting investor sentiment. Despite mixed data, including the disappointing ADP Employment Change report, which showed just 22K jobs added in January, well below the expected 48K, the USD maintained its upward momentum. The USD/EUR exchange rate edged higher, trading at 1.0840 as the dollar continued to benefit from market expectations of continued economic strength.

The market reacted to the employment report with cautious optimism, as the shutdown resolution helped lift the USD’s appeal against major currencies. Despite the ADP miss, traders remain focused on the broader economic recovery, keeping the USD in a bullish trend. The EUR/USD pair remained volatile, hovering near 1.0840, with traders anticipating further updates to the US economic outlook. The technical outlook for the USD suggests potential for additional gains if the positive momentum continues in upcoming data releases.

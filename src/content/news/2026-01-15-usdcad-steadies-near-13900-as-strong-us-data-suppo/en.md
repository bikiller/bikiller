USD/CAD continues to trade in positive territory for the third consecutive session, hovering around the 1.3890 level during Thursday's Asian trading hours. The currency pair is benefiting from robust US economic data, which has bolstered the strength of the US Dollar (USD) and influenced market sentiment.

The stronger-than-expected economic indicators out of the US have led traders to speculate on a potential pause in the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. This development has provided the USD with upward momentum, helping USD/CAD maintain its steady exchange rate as investors assess the implications for monetary policy and future trading trends.

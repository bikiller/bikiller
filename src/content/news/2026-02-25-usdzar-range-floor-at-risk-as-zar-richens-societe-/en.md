USD/ZAR continues to trade within a sideways range, with the exchange rate hovering near key technical levels. Societe Generale analysts highlight that the failure to break above the 50-day moving average could lead to further downside pressure on the currency pair. This would expose the range floor, potentially triggering a decline toward lower projections for the South African rand.

The USD/ZAR’s current consolidation phase has left traders cautious, as any failure to overcome the 50-day moving average would suggest continued weakness in the USD against the ZAR. With the rand strengthening, the pair’s outlook remains dependent on the next key support level, which could dictate the broader market’s direction in the short term.

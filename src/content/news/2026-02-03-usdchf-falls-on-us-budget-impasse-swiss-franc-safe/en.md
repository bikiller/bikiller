USD/CHF is trading lower around 0.7780 on Tuesday, down 0.15% on the day. The pair is under pressure as political uncertainty in the United States weighs on the US Dollar, overshadowing recent positive economic data. Traders are concerned over a potential budget impasse, which has led to a shift in market sentiment.

The Swiss Franc, often viewed as a safe-haven currency, is benefiting from this uncertainty. As the USD faces downside risks, demand for the Franc is increasing, pushing the USD/CHF lower. The ongoing US political gridlock continues to dampen investor confidence in the dollar, making the Swiss Franc a more attractive alternative in the current market environment.

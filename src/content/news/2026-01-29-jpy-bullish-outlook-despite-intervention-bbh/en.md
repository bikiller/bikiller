BBH maintains a bullish outlook on the Japanese yen (JPY) despite potential intervention from the U.S. The analysis highlights that USD/JPY remains significantly overvalued when considering the disparity in interest rate differentials between the U.S. and Japan. Despite concerns over Japan's fiscal policy, the report suggests these fears may be overstated, reinforcing the potential for JPY strength in the coming weeks.

The current exchange rate of USD/JPY shows a clear misalignment, as the yen is underappreciated relative to its economic fundamentals. With inflation rates and fiscal policies largely priced in, the JPY is positioned for a rebound. Traders may watch closely for any signs of intervention, but the broader technical setup points to a favorable environment for JPY appreciation, especially if USD weakness continues.

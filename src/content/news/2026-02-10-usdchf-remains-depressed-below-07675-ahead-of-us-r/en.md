The USD/CHF currency pair remains subdued, trading in a narrow range near 0.7650 on Tuesday. This follows a 1.6% decline over the past two trading sessions, as the US Dollar struggles to regain ground against the Swiss Franc. Traders are closely watching the upcoming US Retail Sales data, which is expected to provide fresh direction for the exchange rate.

The lack of significant movement in USD/CHF reflects market uncertainty ahead of the release of key economic figures. The pair has failed to break above the technical resistance at 0.7675, indicating cautious sentiment among investors. A strong retail sales report could offer some relief for the dollar, potentially driving a recovery from recent losses.

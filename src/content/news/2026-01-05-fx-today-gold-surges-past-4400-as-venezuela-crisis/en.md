Gold prices soared past $4,400 as the financial markets reacted to escalating tensions in Venezuela. The U.S. military's intervention, which resulted in the arrest of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, has stirred significant volatility in the region. Traders are closely monitoring the situation, with gold becoming a haven asset amidst the uncertainty surrounding the Venezuelan crisis.

In the forex market, the U.S. dollar (USD) gained traction against major currencies, including the euro (EUR), as investors sought safety. The USD/EUR exchange rate has seen fluctuations, reflecting heightened risk aversion. As geopolitical tensions mount, traders are advised to keep an eye on safe-haven assets and potential shifts in currency pairs, as the implications of these events continue to unfold.

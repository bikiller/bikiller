The GBP/USD currency pair is currently trading in a tight range around the 1.3370-1.3365 level, indicating a period of consolidation as traders await the release of the UK jobs report. Throughout the Asian session on Tuesday, the exchange rate has remained largely unchanged, reflecting market indecision ahead of this key economic data.

As investors keep a close eye on the potential implications of the jobs report, the continued trading in the mid-1.3300s suggests a cautious sentiment. The forthcoming data could significantly influence the direction of the currency pair, with any surprises likely to provoke a stronger market reaction in the coming sessions.

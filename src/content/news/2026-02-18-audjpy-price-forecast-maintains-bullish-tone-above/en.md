The AUD/JPY currency pair remains buoyant, holding steady around 108.55 in early European trading on Wednesday. The Australian Dollar maintains its positive momentum, supported by strong risk sentiment in global markets. Traders are focusing on the upcoming Australian jobs data, which could further influence the pair’s trajectory, particularly if employment numbers exceed expectations.

However, the Japanese Yen faces some upward pressure from increasing optimism surrounding Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's pro-stimulus agenda. If implemented, these policies could provide a boost to Japan's economic growth, making the Yen more attractive in the near term. As the market digests these developments, the 108.50 level remains crucial for AUD/JPY’s bullish outlook, with a break below it potentially signaling a reversal.

Gold (XAU/USD) edged slightly higher on Friday, trading just above the $5,200 mark, although momentum remained limited. The precious metal has struggled to break free from this week's established range, with resistance appearing near the upper boundary. This lack of significant movement comes despite a firmer U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) data release, which typically boosts the U.S. dollar.

The impact of the stronger PPI figures was muted in the gold market, with XAU/USD holding steady as traders remain cautious. The exchange rate for gold fluctuated between the support level at $5,150 and resistance at $5,250 throughout the week. While the data suggests potential inflationary pressures, gold's performance highlights the complex dynamics at play, where the USD's strength and broader market sentiment continue to influence the metal's price action.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil prices remain stable as trading activity slows with the onset of the holiday season. Currently, WTI is trading near two-week highs, reflecting a slight improvement in momentum, despite persistent risks of a downturn if prices dip below the $60 mark. Market participants are closely monitoring these levels as thin liquidity may exacerbate volatility.

The current market environment indicates cautious optimism among traders, with WTI poised for potential gains against a backdrop of fluctuating demand and geopolitical factors. However, any significant dip below the $60 threshold could trigger renewed selling pressure. As the USD continues to fluctuate against major currencies like the EUR, traders should remain vigilant about how these exchange rate movements could impact oil prices and overall market sentiment.

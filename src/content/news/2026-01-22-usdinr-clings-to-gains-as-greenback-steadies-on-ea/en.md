The USD/INR exchange rate remains firm as the Indian Rupee continues to struggle, hovering near its all-time low against the US Dollar. This morning, the currency pair reflects the ongoing strength of the Greenback, which has stabilized amid easing tensions between the US and European Union. As traders assess geopolitical developments, the USD shows resilience, providing a backdrop for the INR's persistent decline.

The Indian Rupee's struggles come as the USD has gained traction, with the exchange rate poised for further movement. Market analysts are closely monitoring the implications of this relationship, particularly as the INR nears critical support levels. Traders are advised to remain vigilant as fluctuations in the currency pair could signal broader market sentiment and economic conditions, impacting trading strategies in the forex market.

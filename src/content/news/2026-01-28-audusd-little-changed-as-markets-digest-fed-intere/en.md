The Australian Dollar (AUD) is trading slightly lower against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the AUD/USD currency pair holding a narrow range. As of mid-day, the exchange rate remains subdued, reflecting a muted market response to the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate decision. Investors are taking a cautious approach, digesting the Fed's tone and its potential impact on future policy.

Despite the Fed’s expected move to maintain its stance, the market reaction has been relatively subdued, with AUD/USD oscillating between key technical levels. Traders are waiting for further cues from economic data and global risk sentiment, as the USD remains supported by its safe-haven status. The exchange rate continues to show resilience, holding steady in a narrow band with limited volatility in the short term.

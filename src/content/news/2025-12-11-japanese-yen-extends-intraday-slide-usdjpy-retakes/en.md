The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued its steady decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, as the USD experienced a modest recovery. The USD/JPY currency pair climbed back to the 156.00 level, marking a fresh daily low for the Yen as the European trading session approached. 

This downward movement reflects broader trends in the forex market, where the rebounding USD has exerted pressure on JPY. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics, as fluctuations in the USD against other major currencies, including the Euro (EUR), could impact overall market sentiment and trading strategies in the coming sessions.

Dow Jones futures dipped by 0.52%, settling around 49,450 during the European session on Monday, mirroring a broader decline in U.S. equity futures. The S&P 500 futures fell by 0.58% to approximately 6,960, while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.82%, trading near 25,720. This downward trend is largely attributed to ongoing concerns about Federal Reserve monetary policy and rising geopolitical tensions, which have created uncertainty in the markets.

As traders adjust their positions amid these challenges, currency pairs are also feeling the impact. The USD is facing pressure against the EUR and other major currencies, reflecting a cautious sentiment in the forex market. The exchange rates are being closely monitored as fluctuations could signal shifts in trading strategies, particularly for investors navigating the complexities of both geopolitical risks and central bank decisions.

The EUR/USD currency pair continues to face downward pressure despite a slight rebound in the Euro on Tuesday, with the exchange rate hovering just above 1.1800. While it briefly tested the 1.1820 level, the Euro has struggled to maintain momentum and is currently unable to establish a firm footing above this technical barrier. 

Strong US economic data, coupled with a reduction in geopolitical concerns, is supporting the US Dollar. As a result, the EUR/USD remains in a tight range, with the greenback gaining a slight edge over the Euro. Traders are closely monitoring further developments in US economic indicators and geopolitical factors, which could dictate the pair's next move.

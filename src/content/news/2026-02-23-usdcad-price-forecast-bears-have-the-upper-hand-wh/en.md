The USD/CAD pair is experiencing support near the 1.3645 level as of Monday, following last week's late pullback from the monthly high. This level has provided temporary stability, but the overall bearish sentiment persists, with the currency pair facing resistance just below the key 1.3700 mark. Market participants continue to monitor the price action closely, with the 200-SMA on the H4 chart acting as a significant barrier.

While the pair has managed to find some footing at the 1.3645 region, the bearish bias remains intact as long as USD/CAD stays below 1.3700. This technical resistance zone, coupled with the ongoing pressure from a stronger Canadian dollar, could keep the pair subdued. Traders will likely focus on potential breakouts or consolidations around these levels, as they signal possible further movements in the exchange rate.

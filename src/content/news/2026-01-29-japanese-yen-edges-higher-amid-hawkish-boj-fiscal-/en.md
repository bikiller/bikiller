The Japanese Yen (JPY) gained ground against the US Dollar (USD) during Thursday's Asian session, bouncing back from a nearly three-month low. Trading at 133.60, the USD/JPY currency pair showed a slight recovery after dipping in the previous day’s session. The yen's rise comes amid a hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), signaling potential tightening measures, which helped fuel the positive momentum.

However, fiscal and political uncertainties surrounding Japan capped further gains for the yen. Despite the BoJ's hawkish outlook, concerns over Japan’s economic policies and political landscape are preventing a more significant rally. The EUR/JPY exchange rate also saw modest movement, holding steady around 144.50, as the broader market focus remains on global risk sentiment, leaving the yen's potential growth restrained in the face of underlying risks.

WTI crude oil prices have slipped below $64.00, trading at $63.80 during early Tuesday's Asian session. The drop comes as concerns over potential supply disruptions in the Middle East have diminished. With these fears easing, traders are reassessing the global oil supply situation, which has led to a decrease in demand for oil, impacting the broader energy market.

This decline in WTI also carries implications for forex markets, particularly for the USD. As oil prices weaken, the demand for the US dollar tends to shift, influencing currency pairs like USD/EUR. A lower WTI could impact inflation expectations and economic outlooks in major oil-consuming countries, which may add volatility to global exchange rates in the short term.

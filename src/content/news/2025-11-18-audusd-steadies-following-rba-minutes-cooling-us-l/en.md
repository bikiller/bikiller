AUD/USD has maintained stability on Tuesday, trading around the exchange rate of 0.6490. This steady performance follows the release of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) minutes, which provided insight into the central bank's outlook and policy stance. Market participants are digesting this information as they navigate the current trading environment.

The currency pair showed little movement despite cooling U.S. labor data, which often influences the strength of the USD. With the Australian dollar showing resilience, traders are closely monitoring developments that could impact both the AUD and USD, including upcoming economic indicators and central bank communications. As the market awaits further clarity, AUD/USD remains a focal point for forex traders.

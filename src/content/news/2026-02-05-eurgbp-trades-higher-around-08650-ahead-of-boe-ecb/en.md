The EUR/GBP currency pair edged higher to 0.8652 during Thursday's late Asian session, with the Euro gaining momentum against a weaker British Pound. As traders awaited the Bank of England's (BoE) monetary policy announcement, which is scheduled for 12:00 GMT, the Pound underperformed, contributing to the uptick in the exchange rate. 

The market is closely watching the BoE's decision, with expectations of possible changes in interest rates or forward guidance. This has created a cautious atmosphere for GBP traders, while EUR/GBP remains supported at the 0.8650 level. With the policy announcement looming, further volatility is expected as investors react to any developments in the BoE's stance.

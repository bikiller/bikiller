The Australian Dollar (AUD) is trading nearly flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, struggling to maintain its position above the crucial support level near 0.6600. This comes as the currency pair attempts to halt a five-day losing streak, having peaked at 0.6679 on December 10. Market sentiment remains cautious amid mixed economic signals from Australia.

Recent employment data has revealed a decline in demand, contributing to the AUD's instability against the USD. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as it hovers around this support area, which could determine the next moves for the currency pair. A sustained breach below 0.6600 may lead to further losses for the Aussie, while a rebound could reignite bullish momentum.

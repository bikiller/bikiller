Scotiabank strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret observe modest gains in the Japanese Yen against the U.S. Dollar, with the Yen outperforming other G10 currencies. However, the recovery remains partial, as the Yen continues to experience a drag from previous Bank of Japan (BoJ)-related losses. Despite this, the Yen has managed to hold its ground within a range, with key technical levels between 152 and 159.50 on the USD/JPY pair.

As traders monitor the USD/JPY pair closely, the market awaits a potential break above or below this range, which could signal further directional movement. The exchange rate dynamics continue to be influenced by factors such as U.S. economic data and Japan’s monetary policy stance. Any shift beyond the 152–159.50 range could set the stage for more significant price action, making it a crucial level for traders in the coming days.

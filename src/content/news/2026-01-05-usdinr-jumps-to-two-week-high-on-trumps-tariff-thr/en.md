The USD/INR surged to a two-week high as the Indian Rupee faced pressure against the US Dollar at the market's open on Monday. The exchange rate for the currency pair reached a fresh low, reflecting growing concerns over geopolitical risks and recent tariff threats from former President Donald Trump. This volatility has traders closely monitoring market sentiment as uncertainties continue to shape trading strategies.

In the broader context, the turmoil surrounding the USD/INR highlights the impact of external factors on currency movements. As investors weigh the implications of potential trade conflicts, the Indian Rupee's weakness could lead to further fluctuations in the exchange rate. The heightened volatility may prompt investors to reassess their positions amid shifting geopolitical landscapes and evolving economic indicators.

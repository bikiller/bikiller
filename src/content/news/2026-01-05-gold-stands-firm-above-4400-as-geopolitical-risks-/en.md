Gold (XAU/USD) maintains strong intraday gains, remaining firmly above the $4,400 threshold during the Asian session on Monday. The precious metal's resilience stems from heightened geopolitical risks, which have significantly bolstered safe-haven demand among investors seeking stability in turbulent times.

As concerns about global instability continue to rise, traders are increasingly turning to gold as a reliable store of value, contributing to its upward momentum. This shift in market sentiment is reflected in the exchange rates, as investors reassess their positions in other currency pairs, including the USD and EUR, amid this flight to safety. With gold's technical outlook looking promising, analysts anticipate further gains if prevailing uncertainties persist.

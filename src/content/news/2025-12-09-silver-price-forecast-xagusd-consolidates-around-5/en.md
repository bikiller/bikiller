Silver prices (XAG/USD) remained steady around the $58.00 mark during the late Asian trading session on Tuesday. The currency pair has entered a consolidation phase as traders adopt a cautious stance, anticipating the upcoming monetary policy announcement from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. This event is poised to influence market sentiment and trading strategies.

As investors closely monitor the Fed's decision, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the USD may impact silver's appeal as a safe haven asset. A shift in policy could either bolster or weaken the white metal's performance in the days ahead, highlighting the importance of central bank actions in the forex market. With market participants on edge, the volatility surrounding XAG/USD is likely to intensify following the Fed's announcement.

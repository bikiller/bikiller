GBP/USD is currently trading around 1.3380, showing a slight recovery after modest losses in the previous session. The currency pair remains under pressure, staying below the critical 1.3400 level as the US Dollar strengthens amid cautious sentiment regarding Federal Reserve policy. Traders are closely watching economic indicators that could influence the Fed's upcoming decisions.

The recent gains in the USD reflect growing concerns over inflation and potential interest rate adjustments. As the market digests these developments, the exchange rate of GBP/USD may continue to fluctuate. Investors are keen to see if the British Pound can regain its footing against the Dollar or if it will remain subdued as the Fed's stance shapes market dynamics.

The EUR/JPY currency pair holds a positive stance above the 186.00 mark during Friday's Asian session. At 186.25, the exchange rate reflects the Japanese Yen's softness following the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) decision to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged. This move has led to a slight depreciation of the JPY against the Euro, as market participants continue to adjust their positions.

As traders look ahead, attention will shift to the BoJ press conference later in the day for further insights into Japan's monetary policy outlook. While the rate decision was largely expected, any hints on future actions could impact the EUR/JPY exchange rate. With the pair maintaining positive momentum, a break above 186.50 could signal further upside potential, while a pullback below 186.00 may indicate a shift in sentiment.

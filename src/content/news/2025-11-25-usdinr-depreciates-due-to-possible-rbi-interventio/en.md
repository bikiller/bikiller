The Indian Rupee (INR) continues its upward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD), marking its second consecutive day of gains. The USD/INR pair is currently trading lower due to speculation surrounding potential intervention by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This intervention is expected to stabilize the INR amid fluctuating market conditions.

Market sentiment is also influenced by increasing expectations of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve, which has further driven the USD down against major currencies. As traders assess the implications of these monetary policies, the exchange rate for USD/INR has seen notable shifts, prompting analysts to closely monitor the currency pair for signs of further volatility in the coming sessions.

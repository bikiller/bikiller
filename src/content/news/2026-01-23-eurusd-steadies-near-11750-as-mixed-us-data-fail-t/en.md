The EUR/USD exchange rate remained steady around 1.1750 on Friday, as mixed economic data from the US failed to provide any significant momentum for the US Dollar. Despite fluctuating reports, the currency pair showed limited movement, with traders largely ignoring the latest figures. The pair remains in a tight range as market participants await clearer signals.

As of now, EUR/USD is set to record its first weekly gain in three weeks, largely due to persistent weakness in the Greenback. With the Euro holding its ground, the USD struggles to capitalize on the data, keeping the exchange rate relatively stable. This steady performance highlights the ongoing market indecision as both currencies face headwinds.

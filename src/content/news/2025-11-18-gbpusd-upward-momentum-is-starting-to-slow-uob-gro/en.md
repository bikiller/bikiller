The GBP/USD currency pair is currently trading within a range, with expectations for movement between 1.3125 and 1.3185. However, analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, suggest that the upward momentum for the Pound Sterling is beginning to wane. A significant breach of the support level at 1.3105 could signal a potential shift towards range-trading for the GBP.

As traders monitor the exchange rate, the implications of this slowing momentum could lead to increased volatility in the market. Should the Pound fail to maintain its position above the critical 1.3105 level, it may prompt a reevaluation of strategies for both short- and long-term trading positions against the USD. Market participants are advised to stay vigilant for any developments that may impact this currency pair.

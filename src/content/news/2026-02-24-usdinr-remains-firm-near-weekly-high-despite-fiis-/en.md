The Indian Rupee (INR) remains under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the USD/INR pair holding steady near 91.10. Despite strong foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows into the Indian stock market, the rupee continues to struggle. The currency pair managed to retain Monday's gains, but the broader market sentiment remains cautious.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been actively intervening in the forex market, attempting to stabilize the rupee amid rising pressure from a stronger US Dollar. However, the ongoing demand for USD, driven by global economic factors, has prevented any significant strengthening of the INR. With the USD/INR pair hovering around technical levels of 91.10, traders are closely watching further developments in the global markets for cues on the future direction of the currency pair.

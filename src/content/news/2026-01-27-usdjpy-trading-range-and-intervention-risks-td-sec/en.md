I’m missing the actual market details needed to do this cleanly. The excerpt doesn’t include any prices, ranges, percentages, or technical levels, and your requirements say those must be preserved.

Can you paste the full TD Securities note (or at least the key figures: USDJPY levels, trading range, intervention thresholds, dates)? Once I have that, I’ll turn it into a tight 150–200-word forex article that hits all your criteria.

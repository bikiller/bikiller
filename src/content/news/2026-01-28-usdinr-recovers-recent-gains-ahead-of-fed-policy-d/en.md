The USD/INR currency pair has regained some of its recent losses, rising after a 0.25% decline in the previous session. The exchange rate has moved closer to its all-time high of 91.96, reached on January 23, as the US Dollar strengthens. Traders remain cautious as they await the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy decision, with market sentiment largely influenced by expectations of the Fed's stance on interest rates.

The US Dollar's recovery reflects broader market uncertainty, with investors positioning themselves ahead of the Fed's announcement. As the USD/INR pair moves higher, attention shifts to potential volatility in the wake of the policy update. The exchange rate's movement toward the January high highlights ongoing strength in the USD, while market participants closely monitor the Fed's actions for any signs of future tightening or dovishness.

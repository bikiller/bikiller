Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a slight pullback on Wednesday after hitting two-week highs, trading around $4,145. The precious metal's recent ascent was fueled by a dovish outlook from the Federal Reserve, which had encouraged bullish sentiment among traders. However, this momentum faltered as the US Dollar (USD) began to rebound following the release of new economic data, impacting gold's appeal as an alternative investment.

As the USD strengthened, the exchange rate shift prompted traders to reassess their positions in gold. A firmer dollar typically weighs on gold prices, as it makes the commodity more expensive for holders of other currencies. The interplay between the USD and XAU/USD will be crucial in determining short-term market trends, as investors closely monitor economic indicators that may influence Federal Reserve policy moving forward.

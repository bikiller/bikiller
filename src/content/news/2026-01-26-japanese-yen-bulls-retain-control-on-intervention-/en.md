The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues its bullish momentum, supported by concerns over potential intervention, a hawkish Bank of Japan (BoJ), and a generally weaker US Dollar (USD). The currency pair, USD/JPY, opened with a gap on Monday, marking a fresh high since November 14, reaching 132.48. The Yen’s strength comes as traders speculate that the BoJ may take a more aggressive stance on tightening policy, while USD weakness adds pressure on the pair.

As USD/JPY extends its upward trend, the US Dollar faces challenges from softer economic data and ongoing market expectations of a Federal Reserve pause. This dynamic allows the JPY to maintain its upward trajectory, with the currency pair continuing to hold above key technical levels. The Japanese Yen’s recent rise signals a shift in market sentiment, emphasizing the impact of both domestic monetary policy and global USD dynamics on forex trading.

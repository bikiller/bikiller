The Colombian Peso (COP) strengthened following a key legal ruling that suspended the government’s proposed 23% minimum wage hike. The country’s Council of State ruled that the increase, which had been set to take effect under President Petro's administration, lacked proper economic justification. This ruling prompted the government to issue a new decree, justified within eight days. 

The suspension of the wage hike provided some relief to markets, as investors were concerned about the inflationary impact of such a significant rise. The move helped stabilize the USD/COP exchange rate, with the Colombian Peso seeing gains against the dollar. The decision adds a layer of uncertainty for the near term, but the market is closely watching for the next steps from President Petro’s administration. The ruling could influence trading strategies, particularly for USD and EUR pairs.

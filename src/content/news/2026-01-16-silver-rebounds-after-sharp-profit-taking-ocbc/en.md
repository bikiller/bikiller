Silver prices saw a notable recovery overnight, bouncing back after a sharp pullback that was largely triggered by profit-taking. Following a remarkable year-to-date surge of over 25%, the precious metal found support at the 91.29 levels. Analysts from OCBC, Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong, highlight that this rebound illustrates the volatility often seen in commodity trading, particularly when a significant rally invites profit-taking actions.

As traders recalibrate their positions, silver's recent movements reflect the broader dynamics in the forex market, where fluctuations in currency pairs can influence commodity valuations. The exchange rate of silver against the USD remains closely watched, especially as investors weigh global economic indicators. The implications of this rebound may set the tone for future trading sessions, as market participants assess whether silver can maintain its upward momentum or if further corrections are on the horizon.

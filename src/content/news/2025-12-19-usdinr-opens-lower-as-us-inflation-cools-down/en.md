The Indian Rupee (INR) opened on a bullish note against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, reflecting a positive sentiment in the forex market as US inflation figures showed signs of cooling. The USD/INR exchange rate dipped, indicating a potential shift in trading patterns as investors react to macroeconomic indicators. 

Market analysts suggest that the easing inflation in the US could lead to a more dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, potentially weakening the dollar further. As the currency pair continues to adjust, the INR may gain traction, benefitting from improved risk appetite among traders. This movement could set the stage for further volatility in the USD/INR exchange rate in the upcoming sessions.

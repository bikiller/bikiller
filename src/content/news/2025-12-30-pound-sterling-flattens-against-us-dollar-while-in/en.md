The Pound Sterling (GBP) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) at approximately 1.3500 during Tuesday's European trading session. This position is notably close to the three-month high of 1.3535 reached last week, indicating a period of consolidation for the GBP amid cautious investor sentiment.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming FOMC Minutes, with expectations that insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy could influence the exchange rate dynamics. As traders await these developments, the currency pair's stability suggests a wait-and-see approach, reflecting uncertainty about future economic indicators and their potential impact on the USD.

The AUD/USD currency pair has dipped slightly, trading near the 0.6700 level during the European session on Tuesday. This movement comes as the US Dollar shows a modest uptick ahead of the critical inflation data release. Traders are awaiting the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December, set to be published at 13:30 GMT, which could influence market sentiment and affect the exchange rate.

As the market anticipates the CPI figures, fluctuations in the AUD/USD exchange rate reflect a broader trend in currency trading, where the strength of the USD plays a pivotal role. Should the CPI results indicate stronger-than-expected inflation, the USD could gain further traction, potentially exerting downward pressure on the Australian Dollar. Market participants remain vigilant as these data points could set the tone for trading in the coming days.

EUR/JPY has experienced a pullback, trading around the 181.00 mark during Thursday's European session. This decline follows a period of recent gains as the market responds to strengthening interest in the Japanese Yen (JPY). The exchange rate is facing increasing pressure, primarily driven by growing speculation regarding potential intervention by the Japanese authorities to support the currency.

As traders weigh the implications of a possible intervention, the shift in sentiment could lead to increased volatility within the currency pair. With the USD also in focus, market participants are keenly observing how these developments will influence overall trading strategies in the forex arena. The dynamics of EUR/JPY continue to be shaped by both domestic factors in Japan and broader international market trends.

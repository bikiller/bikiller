Oil prices have come under significant downward pressure, with Brent crude falling over USD 4 from last week’s close. The decline is attributed to ongoing geopolitical tensions and strategic production cuts by OPEC+. These developments have intensified market volatility, contributing to uncertainty in global oil trading.

The drop in oil prices has a direct impact on the forex market, especially in currency pairs involving the USD and EUR. As oil remains a key global commodity, fluctuations influence exchange rates, particularly in emerging markets reliant on oil exports. Traders are closely watching further geopolitical developments, which could lead to additional price movements in both commodities and currencies.

The release of October’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is expected to have a mildly hawkish impact on the Bank of England's monetary policy, according to ING's FX analyst Chris Turner. This development may strengthen GBP trading as investors react to potential shifts in interest rates. The exchange rate for GBP/USD could see upward pressure, enhancing its appeal against the USD as inflation concerns linger.

As traders assess the implications of the CPI results, the currency pair may aim for technical levels above 1.40. A stronger-than-expected CPI could fuel further speculation about upcoming monetary tightening by the BoE, influencing market sentiment across other pairs, including EUR/GBP. The broader implications for GBP's performance against the EUR and USD could shape trading strategies in the short term, as analysts watch for additional economic indicators.

GBP/USD surged to fresh four-year highs, extending its rally for a second consecutive week as the US Dollar collapsed across the board. The exchange rate benefited from broad USD selling, with traders reacting to renewed trade war rhetoric that continues to erode confidence in the Greenback. The currency pair’s upside momentum reflects shifting sentiment in global forex trading.

Persistent concerns over protectionist policies and escalating geopolitical tensions have weighed heavily on the USD, dragging it lower against major peers. Sterling capitalized on this weakness, outperforming not only the Dollar but also keeping pace with gains seen in EUR/USD and other major currency pairs. The Greenback’s decline suggests investors are reassessing US economic resilience.

From a technical perspective, the break above multi-year highs signals a bullish structure for GBP/USD, reinforcing expectations of further upside if USD pressure persists. Traders are now watching whether the pair can consolidate above these levels or attract fresh buying interest. Near-term trading will hinge on incoming macro signals and any shifts in trade-related headlines impacting USD sentiment.

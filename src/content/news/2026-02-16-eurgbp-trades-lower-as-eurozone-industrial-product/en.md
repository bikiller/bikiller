EUR/GBP continues to trade lower on Monday, with the Euro weakening against the British Pound amid disappointing Eurozone industrial production data. As of writing, the currency pair is hovering around the 0.8689 level, staying within the narrow range it has held for the past week. The lack of significant market movement is due to thin trading conditions, keeping the exchange rate subdued.

Market participants are now awaiting key UK economic data, which could influence the next direction for the EUR/GBP. With the Eurozone's data failing to support the single currency, the focus will shift to any potential surprises from the UK figures. If the UK's data comes in strong, it could push EUR/GBP lower, testing recent support levels.

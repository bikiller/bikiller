The USD/CHF exchange rate is trading at 0.7730 on Friday, marking a decline of 0.21% for the day after a brief rally in the previous session. The Swiss Franc (CHF) is gaining ground as it benefits from safe-haven demand amid rising geopolitical tensions. The uncertain global trade environment further fuels the currency's appeal, drawing investors seeking stability.

The move reflects a broader shift in market sentiment as traders react to geopolitical risks that have heightened over recent days. With concerns about trade disruptions lingering, the Swiss Franc's safe-haven status is increasingly sought after, putting pressure on the USD/CHF pair. As these risks persist, further fluctuations in the pair are expected.

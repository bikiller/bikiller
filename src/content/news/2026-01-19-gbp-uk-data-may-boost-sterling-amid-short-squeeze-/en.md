UK economic data, including November's jobs figures and December's Consumer Price Index (CPI), is anticipated to provide a modest lift to the British pound. This potential uptick could further extend the short squeeze that has been developing since late November, as traders react to positive economic signals. 

As the market digests this data, GBP/USD could see increased trading activity, potentially breaking through key resistance levels. The exchange rate's movement may also influence related currency pairs, such as EUR/GBP, as investors reassess their positions. Overall, stronger UK data could bolster sterling's attractiveness, leading to a shift in market dynamics.

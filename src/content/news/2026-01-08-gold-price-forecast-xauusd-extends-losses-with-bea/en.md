Gold (XAU/USD) continued its downward trend on Thursday, marking a second consecutive day of losses as it faced resistance at the $4,500 level. The precious metal's recent decline is part of a broader weakness affecting commodities, prompting bearish traders to eye the previous support area at $4,400. This shift in sentiment reflects growing concerns over economic stability and interest rate trajectories.

As bears gain momentum, the exchange rate for XAU/USD could be influenced by fluctuations in the USD and broader market dynamics. Traders are closely monitoring technical indicators and resistance levels, which may guide future trading strategies. If the price dips below the $4,400 mark, it could signal further sell-offs, impacting not only gold but also the overall landscape for precious metals in the forex market.

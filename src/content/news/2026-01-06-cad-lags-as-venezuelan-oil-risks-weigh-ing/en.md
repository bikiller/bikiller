The Canadian Dollar (CAD) has emerged as the weakest currency in the G10, primarily pressured by concerns surrounding Venezuelan oil supply disruptions. As traders assess the potential impacts on global oil markets, the CAD's exchange rate has shown considerable vulnerability, particularly against the USD. ING's FX analyst, Francesco Pesole, highlights that these oil supply risks are compounding the uncertainty stemming from ongoing USMCA trade negotiations.

As the market navigates through these developments, the CAD continues to lag in performance, influencing trading strategies across the currency pairs. The weakening CAD against the USD reflects broader market sentiments, with volatility expected to persist as traders closely monitor both oil price fluctuations and trade talks. This situation may lead to further depreciation if oil supply issues worsen or if USMCA negotiations fail to yield a favorable outcome.

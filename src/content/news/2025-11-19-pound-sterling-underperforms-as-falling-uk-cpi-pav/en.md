The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced significant declines against major currencies on Wednesday, driven by the latest UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for October, which revealed a drop in inflation. As a result, GBP/USD slid to a new low of 1.2160, while GBP/EUR fell to 1.1440, reflecting a broader market response to the weaker economic outlook.

The falling CPI figures have intensified speculation around a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), raising concerns among traders about the currency's future strength. With GBP under pressure, investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators and central bank communications that could further influence exchange rates in the GBP/USD and GBP/EUR pairs.

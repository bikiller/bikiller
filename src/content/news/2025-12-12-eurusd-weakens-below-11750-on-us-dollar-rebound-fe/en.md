The EUR/USD currency pair experienced a decline, dipping below the 1.1750 level to around 1.1735 during the early European session on Friday. This move marks a retreat from a 10-week high, as the US Dollar regained some strength. The rebound in the USD has exerted downward pressure on the exchange rate, impacting trader sentiment.

Despite the recent weakness, potential losses for the EUR/USD pair may be capped by the anticipation of US Federal Reserve rate cuts in the coming year. This outlook could provide some support for the euro, as traders weigh the implications of monetary policy shifts in the United States against the backdrop of current market dynamics.

The US Dollar Index is currently hovering around the 97.00 level as traders await critical Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, which could significantly influence exchange rates. Market participants are closely monitoring the potential impact of inflation on the USD, particularly in relation to major currency pairs like EUR/USD. A stronger-than-expected CPI reading may bolster the dollar, while a weaker outcome could lead to increased volatility.

In related market news, the International Energy Agency (IEA) has revised its global oil demand forecast, projecting a surplus of 3.7 million barrels per day by 2026. This adjustment could have implications for the commodity markets, particularly affecting currencies tied to oil exports, such as CAD and NOK, as traders reassess the outlook for energy prices. The evolving dynamics in oil supply and demand may further influence forex trading strategies in the coming months.

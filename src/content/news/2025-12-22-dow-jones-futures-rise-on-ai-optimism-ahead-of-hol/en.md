Dow Jones futures gained 0.14% in Monday's European session, trading above 48,500, fueled by optimism surrounding artificial intelligence advancements. This positive sentiment extended to other major indices, with S&P 500 futures climbing 0.35% to approximately 6,910 and Nasdaq 100 futures increasing by 0.53% to around 25,700. Traders are closely monitoring these developments as they influence broader market dynamics.

The rise in U.S. equity futures may impact the forex market, particularly the USD/EUR exchange rate, as investor confidence strengthens. A bullish mood in equities often leads to a stronger dollar, affecting trading strategies across various currency pairs.

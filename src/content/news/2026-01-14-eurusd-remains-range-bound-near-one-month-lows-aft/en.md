The EUR/USD currency pair is currently trading in a narrow range near one-month lows, reflecting a subdued market response to recent mixed economic data from the United States. On Wednesday, the Euro (EUR) remains little changed against the US Dollar (USD), as traders absorb the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) and Retail Sales figures, which delivered an ambiguous signal regarding the strength of the US economy.

As the exchange rate hovers around critical support levels, the market's cautious sentiment suggests that investors are weighing the implications of the data on future monetary policy decisions. With the EUR/USD struggling to gain momentum, the outlook remains uncertain, and traders will closely monitor upcoming economic indicators for clearer direction.

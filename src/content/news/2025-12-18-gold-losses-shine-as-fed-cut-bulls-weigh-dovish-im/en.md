Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a setback on Thursday, retreating from earlier gains as it approached the all-time high of $4,381, reaching $4,374 shortly after a weaker-than-expected US inflation report was released. The softer Consumer Price Index (CPI) data has led traders to reassess expectations around future Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, weighing on gold's appeal as a non-yielding asset.

At the time of writing, XAU/USD is trading at $4,335, reflecting a cautious sentiment in the market. The fluctuations in gold prices highlight the ongoing impact of US economic indicators on the currency pair, as investors continue to navigate the implications of potential dovish monetary policy from the Federal Reserve amid persistent inflation concerns.

Gold (XAU/USD) surged to a record high of approximately $4,766 on Tuesday, breaking the $4,750 barrier amid intensifying geopolitical tensions. The escalating trade war between the US and the European Union has put additional pressure on US assets, leading traders to seek refuge in the safe-haven metal. This surge comes as global bond yields spiked following a disappointing 20-year debt auction earlier in the day.

The rising uncertainty in the market has prompted investors to reassess their positions, significantly impacting the USD's exchange rate against other currencies. As gold prices soar, the implications for trading strategies are clear: many market participants are pivoting towards commodities, resulting in volatility across forex pairs. The dynamics between the EUR and USD could shift further as investors react to these evolving geopolitical landscapes.

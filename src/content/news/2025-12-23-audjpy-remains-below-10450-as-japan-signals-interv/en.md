AUD/JPY has seen a decline after four consecutive days of gains, now trading around 104.30 during the European session on Tuesday. This pullback follows a recent peak at 104.62, the highest level since July 2024, reached just a day earlier. 

The downward movement coincides with signals from Japanese authorities indicating readiness for potential market intervention to stabilize the yen. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as any intervention could significantly impact the currency pair's trajectory in the coming sessions.

The EUR/USD currency pair is maintaining its upward momentum, recently closing at 1.1879. Traders are optimistic about potential gains, although reaching the significant resistance level at 1.1920 appears unlikely in the near term. As the exchange rate continues to show strength, market participants will be closely monitoring this resistance.

Support levels have been identified at 1.1855 and 1.1830, providing a buffer for the EUR/USD as it navigates this upward trend. The current market movement suggests that while the euro is gaining against the USD, traders should remain cautious, as fluctuations near these technical levels could influence future trading decisions.

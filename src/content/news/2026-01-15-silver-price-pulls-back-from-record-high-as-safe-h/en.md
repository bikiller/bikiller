Silver (XAG/USD) has experienced a notable decline, trading at approximately $91.70 per ounce on Thursday, down 1.70% for the day. Earlier in the session, the precious metal surged to a record high close to $94, fueled by strong safe-haven demand. However, the market is now witnessing a correction as traders engage in profit-taking.

The drop in silver prices reflects a partial retreat from safe-haven assets, which has impacted the overall trading dynamics in the forex market. As investors reassess their positions, the exchange rate for silver against the USD may continue to fluctuate, potentially influencing sentiment in other currency pairs, including EUR/USD. The recent volatility suggests that market participants will closely monitor developments that could affect silver demand in the coming days.

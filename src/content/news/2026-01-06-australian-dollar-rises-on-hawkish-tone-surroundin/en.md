The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, marking its third consecutive day of gains. The currency pair saw an uptick as traders reacted to a hawkish outlook from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). This shift in sentiment has led to increased speculation about potential interest rate hikes, further bolstering the AUD's position in the forex market.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming release of Australia's November Consumer Price Index (CPI) scheduled for Wednesday. The CPI data is expected to provide additional insights into inflation trends and could significantly influence the exchange rate of AUD/USD. A stronger CPI reading may reinforce the RBA's hawkish stance, potentially driving the AUD higher in the trading sessions to come.

Gold (XAU/USD) continued its upward momentum during the Asian session on Wednesday, breaking through the $5,000 psychological barrier for the second consecutive day. The surge comes amid a global flight to safety, with investors seeking refuge in precious metals as market uncertainty rises. This move pushes gold prices further beyond the $5,050 level, reflecting growing demand for stable assets.

The ongoing rally is largely driven by expectations of a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. As markets anticipate a slower pace of tightening, the USD remains under pressure, further supporting gold’s appeal. The XAU/USD pair’s ascent highlights investor sentiment, with traders increasingly wary of economic instability and geopolitical tensions, turning to gold as a hedge against risk.

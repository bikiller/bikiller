During European trading hours on Wednesday, European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde addressed the potential impact of new trade tariffs, warning they could lead to inflationary pressures in the near term. This sentiment emerged amid ongoing trade disputes between the United States and the European Union, prompting calls for a comprehensive review of the European economic framework. 

The EUR/USD exchange rate reacted to Lagarde's comments, reflecting trader caution as concerns about inflation weighed on market sentiment. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as any escalation in trade tensions could disrupt trading patterns and influence the euro's performance against the dollar. With technical levels in focus, traders are advised to stay alert to potential volatility stemming from these geopolitical factors.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) edged higher against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/CAD trading at 1.3675 during the Asian session on Friday. The pair saw mild losses, continuing the trend from previous days, as the US Dollar faces pressure due to uncertainty surrounding US economic policies. 

Ahead of Canada's GDP data and US Producer Price Index (PPI) release, the CAD has benefitted from a favorable environment, bolstered by expectations of solid economic performance in Canada. Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming reports, which could influence the USD/CAD exchange rate and further drive market sentiment.

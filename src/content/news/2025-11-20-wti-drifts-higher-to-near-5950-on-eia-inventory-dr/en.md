West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are hovering around $59.50 during the Asian trading session on Thursday, reflecting a modest upward trend. This increase comes on the heels of a larger-than-expected draw in US crude inventories, attributed to heightened refinery runs and robust export activities. The shift in supply dynamics is influencing market sentiment, as traders closely monitor the evolving landscape of energy demand.

As the market digests these developments, the implications for the USD and related currency pairs become increasingly significant. A stronger WTI typically bolsters the US dollar, impacting its exchange rate against major currencies like the EUR. With current trading levels, investors are keenly observing how sustained movements in oil prices will affect broader economic indicators and the potential for shifts in monetary policy.

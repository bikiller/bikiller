The AUD/USD currency pair remains above the key 0.7000 level, supported by the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance. The RBA's decision to raise rates by 25 basis points to 3.85% in February marked its first hike in over two years, signaling the central bank's commitment to tackling inflation. This move has bolstered the Australian Dollar as traders price in the potential for further tightening.

Despite the RBA's tightening measures, the USD remains resilient, benefiting from ongoing strength in global risk sentiment and the Federal Reserve’s own aggressive stance. The combination of elevated inflation risks highlighted in the RBA's February meeting minutes and the USD's broad dominance in global markets has kept the AUD/USD pair above 0.7000. However, market participants are watching closely for signs of continued USD strength or additional rate hikes from the RBA.

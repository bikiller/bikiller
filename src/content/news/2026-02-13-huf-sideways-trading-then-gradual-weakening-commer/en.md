EUR/HUF is expected to trade largely sideways around the 375 level in the coming months, according to Commerzbank’s Tatha Ghose. As the Euro continues to appreciate, the exchange rate for the currency pair is forecasted to maintain a relatively stable range. This price action reflects broader market trends, including the EUR's strength against other currencies.

Looking further ahead, Ghose predicts that the EUR/HUF pair will gradually rise toward 400 by the end of 2026, signaling a weakening of the Hungarian Forint. This long-term outlook suggests that despite the current sideways movement, downward pressure on the Forint is expected to persist, driven by broader market conditions and economic factors influencing the Hungarian currency's performance.

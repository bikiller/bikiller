GBP/USD saw a slight decline following the release of UK inflation data on Wednesday. Headline CPI fell to 3%, signaling the continuation of the disinflationary trend the Bank of England has closely monitored. The Retail Price Index also dropped to 3.8%, down from 4.2%, reinforcing expectations that inflationary pressures in the UK are easing. 

This shift in inflation data triggered a modest pullback in the pound against the dollar, as traders adjusted their positions ahead of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes. With the market focusing on potential insights into future US monetary policy, GBP/USD traders are cautious, keeping an eye on the broader implications for interest rates and exchange rate movements.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil prices staged a technical rebound on Tuesday, as buyers entered the market near the $60 psychological level. At the time of writing, WTI is trading around $62.45 per barrel, reflecting a 0.70% gain for the day after recovering from earlier intraday losses. This recovery signals a persistent bullish sentiment, supported by the positive crossover between the 21-day and 50-day Simple Moving Averages (SMA).

The technical indicators suggest that WTI's upside bias remains intact, with the 21-day SMA crossing above the 50-day SMA, a sign of continued upward momentum. As the price holds above the $60 mark, market participants are closely watching this level as a key support point. Any break below it could lead to potential downside risks, while further upside movement could push the price towards new highs.

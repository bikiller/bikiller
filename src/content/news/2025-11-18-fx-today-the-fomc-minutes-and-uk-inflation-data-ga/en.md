The US Dollar (USD) showed a modest upward trend on Tuesday, buoyed by ongoing risk-off sentiment in the markets. As traders remained cautious ahead of significant economic data, including the FOMC Minutes, the USD gained traction against major currency pairs. The exchange rate for USD/EUR reflected this slight strengthening, with the pair hovering around 1.05, indicating investor preference for the dollar amid uncertainty.

Simultaneously, UK inflation data stirred market interest as it could influence the Bank of England's future monetary policy decisions. With inflation pressures remaining a focal point for the GBP, the currency faced volatility against the USD, testing levels near 1.20. The interplay between these key economic indicators underscores a cautious trading environment, with participants keenly watching for signals from both the US and UK central banks that could impact exchange rates in the coming weeks.

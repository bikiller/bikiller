The USD/CAD currency pair pulled back to the 1.3700 level during the Asian trading session on Friday, after earlier gains. The pair's decline comes as oil prices rebound, providing support for the Canadian Dollar (CAD), which is closely linked to the commodity. This shift highlights the sensitivity of CAD to movements in the oil market, a key driver for the Canadian economy.

Despite the pullback, USD/CAD remains within a broad trading range, with the 1.3700 level acting as a key support point. As oil prices recover, the CAD stands to benefit, potentially pushing the pair lower. Traders will be watching for further fluctuations in crude oil prices, as they remain a significant factor in the pair's near-term outlook.

Gold prices surged over 1% on Friday, climbing above the $5,060 mark as US economic growth slowed and inflation exceeded expectations. The Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key inflation measure for the Federal Reserve, showed inflation rising past the 3% threshold, intensifying market concerns. This move triggered a significant selloff in the US Dollar, boosting demand for safe-haven assets like gold.

The USD experienced notable weakness against major currencies, with the EUR/USD exchange rate climbing as the market reacted to the decelerating growth and rising inflation. The softer-than-expected GDP data added to the pressure on the Greenback, while gold’s rally was fueled by investor flight to stability. Traders are now anticipating further shifts in Fed policy, with expectations for dovish moves increasing, which could continue to weigh on the USD in the coming weeks.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have dipped below $58.00, currently trading around $57.80 during early European hours on Tuesday. This decline follows a more than 2% increase in the previous session, reflecting market sensitivity to geopolitical developments. The drop was prompted by comments from U.S. President Donald Trump regarding the potential sale of seized Venezuelan crude, which could impact global supply dynamics.

As the market digests this news, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the USD and other currency pairs. The possibility of increased crude supply from Venezuela may weigh on oil prices further, influencing exchange rates involving the USD and EUR. Investors remain vigilant as they assess how these developments will shape oil trading strategies in the coming days.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has surged to a four-month high, trading at approximately $63.60 during the Asian session on Thursday. This increase comes as a result of declining US crude oil inventories and rising geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran, contributing to bullish sentiment among traders.

The drop in US inventories signals a tightening supply, which often leads to higher prices in the crude oil market. As a result, the upward movement in WTI is likely to impact related currency pairs, potentially strengthening the USD against the EUR as energy prices influence inflation expectations and economic outlooks. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments for further market implications.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) remained stable against major currencies as trading volume thinned during the last week of 2025. The GBP/USD exchange rate held steady around 1.3500, reflecting a generally firm outlook for the British currency. Investors are anticipating a moderate easing cycle from the Bank of England (BoE) in 2026, which has contributed to the stability in the market.

This cautious optimism towards the GBP is also seen in its performance against the Euro (EUR), with the currency pair maintaining a steady trajectory. The market's focus on potential shifts in BoE policy has kept traders engaged, as they weigh the implications of a changing monetary environment on the broader economy. As year-end approaches, the GBP's resilience in this thin trading session underscores investor sentiment ahead of anticipated policy changes.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have dipped below $56.50, currently trading around $56.35 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This decline comes as optimism grows regarding a potential peace deal to resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, contributing to a bearish sentiment in the oil market. As the situation evolves, traders are closely monitoring developments that could impact supply and demand dynamics.

The shift in sentiment has led to increased selling pressure on WTI, affecting the crude oil exchange rate against major currencies. The fluctuations in oil prices are expected to influence broader market movements, particularly in currency pairs involving the USD and EUR, as energy costs often correlate with inflationary trends. Market participants are advised to stay vigilant as geopolitical developments unfold, potentially reshaping trading strategies in the days ahead.

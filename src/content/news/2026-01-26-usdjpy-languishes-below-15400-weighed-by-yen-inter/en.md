The USD/JPY exchange rate is struggling to maintain momentum, trading below the key 154.00 level due to rising concerns over potential intervention in the Japanese Yen. On Monday, the Yen reversed previous losses, emerging as the top performer among the G8 currencies. Speculation that the US and Japan might coordinate efforts to curb the JPY's weakness sent the currency pair sharply lower.

The USD/JPY dropped nearly 3.5% from Friday's highs, reaching fresh 11-week lows in the mid-153.00s. This pullback highlights the market’s sensitivity to intervention risks, as traders anticipate moves from both central banks. The shift in sentiment has raised uncertainty, keeping the pair under pressure in the short term, with key technical levels now in focus for potential price action.

EUR/USD remains under pressure, trading at approximately 1.1680 during the Asian session on Thursday, following four consecutive days of losses. The currency pair's performance reflects a notable weakening momentum, as indicated by the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which sits at 42.6, crossing below the critical 50 midline and signaling a neutral to bearish outlook.

The recent decline in the exchange rate highlights ongoing challenges for the euro against the US dollar, driven by various market factors. Traders are closely monitoring economic indicators and geopolitical developments that could further impact the EUR/USD pair, as the market seeks clarity on future monetary policies and risk sentiment. As momentum continues to falter, the potential for further downward movement remains a critical consideration for forex participants.

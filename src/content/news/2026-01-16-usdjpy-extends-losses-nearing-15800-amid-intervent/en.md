The USD/JPY currency pair is extending its losses, trading just above 158.10, down 0.3% during Friday’s European session. After reaching a peak of 159.45 earlier this week, the pair has retraced as the Japanese authorities have intensified their warnings regarding intervention in the foreign exchange market. 

This shift reflects growing concerns over the Yen's depreciation, prompting speculation about potential measures from the Bank of Japan. As traders monitor the situation closely, the exchange rate dynamics may continue to be influenced by policymakers' actions, impacting both the USD and JPY in the coming sessions.

The Thai Baht’s rally against the USD faltered in January as a sharp correction in gold prices disrupted retail gold markets, creating increased two-way foreign exchange (FX) flows. This pause in the Baht’s momentum has seen the USD/THB exchange rate remain under pressure. UOB economists Enrico Tanuwidjaja and Sathit Talaengsatya suggest a gradual downside bias for the currency pair, driven by ongoing volatility and mixed market sentiment.

The Bank of Thailand continues to monitor and manage fluctuations in the Baht, particularly those linked to gold trading. The central bank has maintained efforts to smooth out volatility, reflecting concerns over the impact of gold-linked FX flows on the Baht’s stability. As global markets digest gold price movements, the USD/THB remains sensitive to these developments, with traders closely observing any shifts in central bank policy or external market conditions.

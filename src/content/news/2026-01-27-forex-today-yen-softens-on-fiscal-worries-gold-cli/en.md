The Japanese yen weakened amid growing concerns about Japan's fiscal policy, with the USD/JPY trading at 110.50, marking a 0.3% increase. This decline in the yen comes as investors assess the potential implications of government spending plans and their effects on inflation and economic growth. Analysts predict that continued fiscal stimulus may further pressure the yen in the near term.

Meanwhile, gold prices surged, climbing to nearly $5,100 per ounce, as safe-haven demand rose amid market uncertainty. The EUR/USD exchange rate hovered around 1.0850, reflecting a cautious sentiment in the forex market. Traders are closely monitoring geopolitical tensions and economic indicators, as these factors could significantly influence currency movements and the overall trading landscape in the coming weeks.

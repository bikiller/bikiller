AUD/USD is under pressure on Thursday, as a stronger US Dollar continues to weigh on the Australian Dollar. The currency pair is currently trading around 0.7078, down 0.60% as broad-based USD strength persists across the forex market. The dollar’s broad rally is driven by expectations surrounding US economic resilience and the Federal Reserve's potential policy tightening.

Despite the USD dominance, the Australian Dollar's downward momentum is partially tempered by a hawkish outlook from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). The RBA's stance on inflation and rate hikes has supported AUD to some extent, but it hasn't been enough to offset the US Dollar's strength in the current trading environment. Traders are closely watching this dynamic for any potential shifts in momentum.

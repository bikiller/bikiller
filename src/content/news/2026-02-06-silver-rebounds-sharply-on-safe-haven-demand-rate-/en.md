Silver (XAG/USD) surged on Friday, climbing 3.50% to trade around $76.20. The rebound came amid increased safe-haven demand as market participants sought refuge from broader market volatility. This push higher reflects the ongoing uncertainty, with silver benefiting from its status as a traditional hedge during risk-off environments.

The rally in silver prices is also driven by growing expectations of interest rate cuts. As traders anticipate potential shifts in monetary policy, the USD weakened, further boosting demand for non-yielding assets like silver. The XAG/USD exchange rate’s upward momentum signals that investors are positioning themselves for more dovish central bank actions, adding to the metal's appeal in the current market.

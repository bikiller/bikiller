The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its upward momentum against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, marking the fourth consecutive session of gains for the currency pair. Despite a notable easing in Australia's inflation rate in November, the AUD/USD exchange rate has climbed, reflecting positive market sentiment towards the Aussie amid a backdrop of uncertainty for the USD.

Traders are closely monitoring impending economic data from the US, which may further impact the exchange rate. As the market anticipates potential shifts in monetary policy, the strengthening AUD could suggest a robust outlook for the Australian economy, while the USD faces challenges. The current trend highlights the dynamics of trading between these major currencies, with implications for investors looking to capitalize on fluctuations in the forex market.

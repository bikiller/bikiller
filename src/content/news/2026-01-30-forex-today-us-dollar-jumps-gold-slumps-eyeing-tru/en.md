The US Dollar surged on Friday, January 30, as traders reacted to the anticipation surrounding President Trump’s potential nominee for the Federal Reserve Chair position. The USD rose significantly against major currencies, with the EUR/USD trading at 1.1200, marking a 0.5% decline from the previous close. This rally in the Dollar has led to a notable downturn in gold prices, which slipped to $1,847 per ounce, reflecting a 1.2% drop.

Market sentiment has shifted as investors speculate on possible changes in monetary policy with a new Fed Chair. The strengthening USD has raised concerns for commodities and other currencies, as the exchange rate dynamics continue to create volatility in the forex market. As traders adjust their positions, attention remains fixed on economic indicators and geopolitical developments that may further influence the Dollar’s trajectory.

The USD/ZAR downtrend continues, as noted by Societe Generale in their latest report. After breaking through recent consolidation levels, the pair is poised to target key technical levels, with the exchange rate expected to drift toward 15.25. The movement follows a broader trend of weakness in the USD relative to the South African rand, signaling continued downward pressure.

The report further highlights that the USD/ZAR could eventually reach the lower boundary of its multi-month descending channel, which lies between 15.00 and 14.70. If the pair maintains its current pace, traders will likely focus on these levels for potential breakouts or reversals, marking significant shifts in market sentiment. The ongoing downtrend reflects broader risk-on sentiment and the impact of global market dynamics on the currency pair.

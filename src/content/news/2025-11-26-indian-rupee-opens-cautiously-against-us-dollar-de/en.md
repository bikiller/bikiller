The Indian Rupee (INR) opened lower against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR pair rising to approximately 89.35. This movement highlights the ongoing pressure on the Rupee, driven by consistent demand for US Dollars from Indian importers and activity in the offshore market.

Market sentiments remain cautious as traders react to shifting expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. Dovish bets have begun to swell, yet the persistent strength of the USD continues to overshadow the INR, reflecting broader trends in currency trading. As the exchange rate fluctuates, the implications for imports and overall economic stability in India remain significant.

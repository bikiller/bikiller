The EUR/USD currency pair is trading slightly lower around 1.1690 during early European hours on Thursday. This follows the dovish rate cut by the US Federal Reserve on Wednesday, which typically would have exerted downward pressure on the USD. Despite the Fed's actions, the Euro remains resilient, preventing the pair from climbing above the 1.1700 threshold.

Traders are now focusing on upcoming US jobless claims data, which could further influence the exchange rate. If the figures indicate a rise in claims, it may reinforce the Fed's stance and enhance the Euro's position against the USD. As the market reacts to these developments, the 1.1700 level continues to serve as a pivotal point for the EUR/USD pair's trading dynamics.

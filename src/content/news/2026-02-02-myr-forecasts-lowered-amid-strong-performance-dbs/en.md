DBS Bank has revised its forecasts for the Malaysian Ringgit (MYR), citing its robust performance against the US Dollar (USD). In its latest Group Research report, DBS highlights the MYR's resilience, with the currency continuing to show strength in recent trading. Factors such as steady oil prices and Malaysia's positive economic outlook have been crucial in bolstering the Ringgit, positioning it as a strong contender in the forex market.

The report also underscores the MYR's strength against other major currencies, including the Euro (EUR). Despite global market volatility, the MYR's performance has outpaced expectations, prompting a downward revision of previous forecasts. As the USD remains under pressure, analysts predict that the MYR will maintain its upward momentum, potentially reaching key technical levels against the USD in the near future.

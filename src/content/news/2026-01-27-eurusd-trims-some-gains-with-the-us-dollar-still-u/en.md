The Euro (EUR) has seen a slight decline, trading near the 1.1850 mark against the US Dollar (USD) as of Tuesday. Despite this recent dip, the EUR has managed to retain most of its gains from the previous week. This resilience in the Euro comes as the USD faces pressure from various factors affecting its strength in the forex market.

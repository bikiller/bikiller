Gold (XAU/USD) is holding within a narrow range on Thursday, trading around $5,060 as stronger-than-expected US employment data dampens prospects for a quick Federal Reserve rate cut. The currency pair remains locked in a consolidation zone between $5,000 and $5,100 this week. With rate-cut expectations cooling, traders are recalibrating their positions ahead of the Fed’s next moves.

Despite this, geopolitical tensions continue to provide some support for gold’s demand, preventing significant downside. The ongoing uncertainties are keeping investors cautious, bolstering gold's safe-haven appeal in the face of volatile global markets. As the USD strengthens, XAU/USD’s movements remain tethered to both economic indicators and broader risk sentiment, keeping traders on alert for any shifts in market dynamics.

The Turkish Lira is facing increasing pressure, with market skepticism and weak capital flows contributing to its decline. As of now, the USD/TRY exchange rate is quickly nearing Commerzbank's quarter-end target of 44.0, driven by rising inflation expectations and deteriorating external balances. This negative sentiment continues to weigh on the Lira, signaling potential further weakness in the near term.

As inflationary pressures mount in Turkey, investors remain cautious about the Lira's stability. The deteriorating external balances add another layer of uncertainty, limiting the currency's appeal. This ongoing volatility in the USD/TRY pair highlights the broader challenges facing emerging market currencies, particularly in the face of global economic uncertainties.

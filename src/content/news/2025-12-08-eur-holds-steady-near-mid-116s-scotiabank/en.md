The Euro (EUR) is maintaining a stable position against the US Dollar (USD), trading in the mid-1.16 range as the North American session begins. According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, this stability marks a continuation of the recent consolidation phase for the EUR/USD currency pair.

As market participants look for catalysts to drive the exchange rate, the current flat trading indicates a period of indecision among traders. The mid-1.16s may serve as a technical pivot point, with potential implications for momentum in either direction as economic data and geopolitical events unfold.

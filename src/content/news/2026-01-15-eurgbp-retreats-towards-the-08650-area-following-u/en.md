The EUR/GBP currency pair has retreated towards the 0.8650 level after the release of stronger-than-expected UK Gross Domestic Product figures. Following an initial rise to session highs around 0.8670, the Euro has surrendered its gains against the resilient British Pound, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

This pullback highlights the impact of robust economic data on currency trading dynamics. As the exchange rate moves lower on the daily chart, traders are likely reassessing their positions, considering the potential for further volatility in the pair. With the current level at 0.8650, market participants will be watching closely for any signs of support or continued downward momentum in the EUR/GBP exchange rate.

GBP/USD has seen a partial recovery following a dovish hold by the Bank of England (BOE) amid increasing political uncertainty in the UK. The central bank kept interest rates at 3.75% but signaled a lower threshold for further easing, adjusting its guidance and cutting inflation forecasts. This shift has raised concerns about future rate cuts, impacting the currency pair’s near-term outlook.

As a result, GBP/USD remains vulnerable to downside pressure. With the exchange rate hovering around key technical levels, the market is closely watching for any developments that might trigger further weakness. The dovish BOE stance, combined with broader economic uncertainties, has created a challenging environment for the British pound against the USD, suggesting potential continued volatility for the currency pair in the coming weeks.

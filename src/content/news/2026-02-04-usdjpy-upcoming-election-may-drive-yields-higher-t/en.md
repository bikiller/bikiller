TD Securities analysts Prashant Newnaha and Alex Loo suggest that Japan’s upcoming Lower House Election could push yields higher, influencing the USDJPY exchange rate. The election, set against a backdrop of economic uncertainty, may prompt shifts in fiscal policy that could lead to increased bond yields. A rise in yields typically strengthens the yen, potentially weighing on the USDJPY pair, which currently trades near 150.

As traders monitor the election, key technical levels in the USDJPY remain in focus. A break below 149.50 could signal further downside, while resistance near 151.00 could cap any bullish momentum. Given the expected policy adjustments, volatility in the currency pair is likely to increase as investors recalibrate their positions. This election-driven shift could offer new trading opportunities in the coming weeks.

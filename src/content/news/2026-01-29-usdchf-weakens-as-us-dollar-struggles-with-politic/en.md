USD/CHF is trading at 0.7660 on Thursday, marking a 0.40% decline for the day. The currency pair is under pressure as the US Dollar (USD) struggles amid growing political and institutional uncertainty in the United States. This weakness in the greenback is amplifying the demand for safe-haven assets, prompting investors to shift toward more stable currencies like the Swiss Franc (CHF).

The ongoing uncertainty surrounding US economic and political conditions is contributing to broader USD weakness, impacting key currency pairs like USD/CHF. As traders continue to digest the volatile landscape, the exchange rate for USD/CHF is seeing increased fluctuations. A further decline in the US Dollar could lead to further pressure on the pair, with key technical support levels coming into focus for traders in the days ahead.

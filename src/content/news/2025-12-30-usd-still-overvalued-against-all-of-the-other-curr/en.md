The US Dollar (USD) continues to be assessed as overvalued against its major currency counterparts, according to Société Générale. Despite significant gains in several currencies this year, purchasing power parity measures indicate that the USD's exchange rate does not accurately reflect its true value. With limited upside expected for the Euro (EUR), traders should remain cautious as the market adjusts to these valuations.

Growing downside risks are particularly evident in the GBP/AUD currency pair, where relative rate support is diminishing as we approach 2026. This erosion of support could lead to increased volatility in trading as market participants reevaluate their positions. Investors should closely monitor these developments, as shifts in the forex landscape may have considerable implications for future currency movements.

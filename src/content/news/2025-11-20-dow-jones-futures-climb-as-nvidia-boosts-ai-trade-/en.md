Dow Jones futures surged 0.62%, approaching 46,500 during European trading hours on Thursday, buoyed by strong performance in the AI sector led by Nvidia. This uptick reflects a broader optimism in the market, as S&P 500 futures climbed 1.29% to around 6,750, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.78%, reaching approximately 25,150. The positive sentiment is underpinned by anticipation surrounding the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data.

As traders look ahead to the release of key economic indicators, the momentum in US equity futures could influence currency pairs, particularly the USD against the EUR. A robust NFP report may bolster the dollar's exchange rate, while any surprises could lead to increased volatility across forex markets. The current trading environment emphasizes the interplay between stock market performance and forex movements, setting the stage for potential shifts in investor sentiment.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) gained traction on Monday, climbing 0.45% against its major currency counterparts to approach an exchange rate of 1.3440. This surge followed the release of the UK’s revised Q3 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, which provided a more positive economic outlook, boosting investor confidence in the currency.

As GBP strengthened, traders looked to capitalize on the momentum, particularly against the US Dollar (USD) and Euro (EUR). This upward movement highlights the Pound's resilience in the forex market, suggesting potential for further gains if upcoming economic indicators continue to support the UK’s recovery narrative. The market will be closely monitoring these developments as trading progresses.

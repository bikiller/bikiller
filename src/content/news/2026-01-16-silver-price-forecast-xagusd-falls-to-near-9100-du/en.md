Silver (XAG/USD) continues to experience downward pressure, falling to approximately $91.00 during European trading hours on Friday. This marks the second consecutive session of losses for the precious metal, as a prevailing risk-on sentiment in the markets prompts investors to seek higher-yielding assets. The shift in market mood has led to reduced demand for safe-haven assets like silver.

The current exchange rate reflects a significant movement in the currency pair, with the ongoing market dynamics suggesting that the risk appetite among traders is influencing the demand for silver. As the market focuses on higher returns, analysts are closely monitoring the implications for silver prices, which could remain under pressure if the bullish sentiment in equity markets persists.

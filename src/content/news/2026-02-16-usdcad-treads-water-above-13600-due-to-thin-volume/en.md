The USD/CAD exchange rate traded slightly lower on Monday, holding around the 1.3610 level during European hours, after a three-day rally. Thin market volumes resulted from the observance of public holidays in both the United States (Presidents’ Day) and Canada (Family Day), leading to muted price action. 

With fewer participants in the market, volatility remains limited, and the currency pair has struggled to maintain upward momentum. Traders are cautious, awaiting a return to normal trading conditions later in the week, which could see the pair resume its recent trend or shift direction based on economic data releases.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) has gained momentum, trading 0.5% higher against the US Dollar (USD) and approaching the 1.3280 mark during Wednesday's European session. This upward movement in the GBP/USD currency pair comes amid speculations surrounding the potential replacement of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with Kevin Hassett emerging as a frontrunner for the position.

Market reactions to these developments highlight the shifting dynamics in forex trading, as investors weigh the implications of potential changes in US monetary policy. A shift in leadership at the Federal Reserve could lead to alterations in interest rate strategies, influencing the USD's exchange rate against major currencies, including the GBP and the Euro (EUR).

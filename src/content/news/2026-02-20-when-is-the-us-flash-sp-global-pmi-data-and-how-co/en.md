The preliminary S&P Global PMI data for the United States will be released today at 14:45 GMT. Market participants are closely watching this figure as it offers insights into the health of the US economy. A stronger-than-expected reading could boost the USD, leading to downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate, potentially pushing it below the 1.0700 level.

In contrast, a disappointing PMI print might weaken the USD, allowing EUR/USD to climb. The pair is currently trading around the 1.0730 region, and any deviation from expectations could trigger sharp moves. Traders are advised to monitor these data points closely, as they may set the tone for short-term trading in the US Dollar against the Euro.

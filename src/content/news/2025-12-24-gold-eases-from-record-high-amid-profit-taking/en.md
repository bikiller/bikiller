Gold prices (XAU/USD) retreated from a record high of $4,526 during early European trading on Wednesday as traders engaged in profit-taking. This pullback reflects a natural correction following the recent surge, and many investors are reassessing their positions in light of the recent price movements.

Additionally, the release of encouraging US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data has created further headwinds for gold, as a stronger USD often leads to a decline in gold's appeal as an alternative investment. The exchange rate dynamics indicate that market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators, which could influence future trading strategies in both gold and the broader forex market.

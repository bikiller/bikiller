The AUD/JPY currency pair has edged lower, trading around 102.70 during the early European session on Thursday. This decline reflects a stronger Japanese Yen, which has gained traction against the Australian Dollar as market sentiment shifts. Traders are reacting to heightened expectations of an imminent interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), anticipated later this week.

Despite the downward movement, the exchange rate remains supported above the 100-day exponential moving average (EMA), suggesting potential resilience in the AUD/JPY pair. As traders monitor central bank signals, any shifts in the BoJ's monetary policy could significantly impact the trading dynamics and the broader forex market. With the focus on upcoming policy decisions, volatility may increase as participants adjust their positions accordingly.

Oil prices are experiencing a downward trend, with WTI Crude trading nearly $1 lower on Monday. The commodity's decline follows a reversal from Friday's highs above $60.00, now reaching session lows near $59.00. As traders anticipate the American session, market sentiment appears to lean bearish, reflecting concerns over demand and potential supply fluctuations.

The decline in oil prices could influence various currency pairs, particularly those involving the USD. A weaker oil market may impact inflation expectations and the broader economic outlook, potentially affecting the exchange rates of the EUR/USD and other pairs. As traders monitor these movements, the implications for energy-related assets and overall market stability remain critical in the upcoming sessions.

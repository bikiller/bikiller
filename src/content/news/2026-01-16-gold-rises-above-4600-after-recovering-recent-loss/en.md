Gold (XAU/USD) has rebounded from recent losses, trading around $4,610 on Friday. This recovery followed a downturn in safe-haven demand as geopolitical tensions in Iran showed signs of easing, which had previously pressured gold prices. The exchange rate reflects the market's shifting sentiment towards risk, with investors reallocating funds amid stabilizing conditions.

Despite its recent rise, gold remains sensitive to global developments, particularly those affecting the USD.

The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) traded in a narrow range against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, holding near multi-month highs. The currency pair hovered just below 0.6550 as traders reacted to the January Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. While the 130K jobs added surpassed the 70K forecast, the impact was muted by a significant 898K downward revision to previous payroll data, fueling uncertainty over the US labor market.

The market's focus shifted to the revised data, which indicated a weaker-than-expected job growth trend in recent months. As a result, the USD faced pressure, struggling to maintain gains despite the positive headline NFP figure. With the NZD/USD exchange rate near key resistance levels, traders remain cautious ahead of further economic reports, particularly as the outlook for the US labor market becomes increasingly uncertain.

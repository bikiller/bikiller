The EUR/USD currency pair continues to hover above the critical support level of 1.1500, reflecting the resilience of economic activity in the Eurozone. Analysts from BBH note that this stability is largely due to expectations that the European Central Bank (ECB) will maintain its current policy stance, which is helping to cushion the euro against a still-restrictive Federal Reserve (Fed) policy.

As traders monitor the exchange rate, the ongoing strength of the euro suggests a tempered response to potential headwinds from the U.S. dollar. With both central banks maintaining their respective policies, market participants will likely focus on economic indicators that could influence future rate decisions. The current dynamics indicate that while the EUR may face some challenges, the 1.1500 support level remains a key line in the sand for traders.

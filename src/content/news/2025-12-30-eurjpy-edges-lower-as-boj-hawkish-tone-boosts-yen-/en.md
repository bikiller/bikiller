EUR/JPY is trading around 183.50 on Tuesday, reflecting a slight decrease of 0.15% for the day. This downward movement comes as the Japanese Yen (JPY) experiences a modest rebound, bolstered by hawkish signals from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Thin trading volumes are typical as markets approach the year-end holidays, contributing to the currency pair's current fluctuations.

The BoJ's shift towards a more hawkish stance has strengthened the JPY, limiting downside potential for the Euro (EUR) against the Yen. As traders assess these developments, the exchange rate dynamics between EUR and JPY are likely to remain influenced by central bank policies, especially with the European Central Bank (ECB) maintaining a steady approach. This interplay of monetary policy signals continues to shape the trading landscape for this currency pair.

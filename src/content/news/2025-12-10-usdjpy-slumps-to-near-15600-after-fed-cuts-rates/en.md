The USD/JPY currency pair experienced a significant decline, trading near the 156.00 level during the early Asian session on Thursday. This drop follows the Federal Reserve's anticipated decision to cut interest rates, which has led to a weakening of the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen. Market participants are closely monitoring the impact of this move on overall trading sentiment.

Investors are also awaiting the release of US weekly Initial Jobless Claims later today, which could further influence the exchange rate. The current market dynamics suggest increased volatility for the USD/JPY pair as traders assess the implications of the Fed's rate decisions and upcoming economic data. As the pair hovers near this key technical level, market watchers remain vigilant for any signs of a potential reversal or further decline.

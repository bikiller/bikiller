Gold (XAU/USD) continues to hold above $4,800, building on its previous rebound from the $4,400 level, the lowest since January 6. The precious metal gained momentum during the Asian session on Tuesday, as a softer U.S. dollar provided support. This price action follows a period of easing geopolitical tensions, which had previously impacted investor sentiment.

The ongoing strength in gold is attributed to the USD's weakness, with market participants adjusting to the latest economic signals. As geopolitical risks subside, traders are turning their attention to the broader dynamics between the EUR and USD, affecting the overall currency landscape. Gold's ability to maintain its gains above key technical levels signals resilience in the face of shifting market conditions.

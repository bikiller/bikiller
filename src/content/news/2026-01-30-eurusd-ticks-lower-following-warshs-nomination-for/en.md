The EUR/USD exchange rate has edged lower following the news of Kevin Warsh’s nomination as the next Federal Reserve Chairman. While the euro slipped, it remains within a narrow trading range, with bullish momentum struggling to breach the 1.1950 mark. The move reflects investor caution over potential shifts in U.S. monetary policy under Warsh’s leadership.

Despite the pullback, the 1.1900 support level is holding firm, preventing further downside movement for now. As traders digest the news, EUR/USD’s price action is likely to stay contained in this range unless fresh developments push the currency pair beyond these key technical levels. The market is cautious, waiting for more clarity on future Fed direction.

The USD/CAD exchange rate saw a modest pullback after two consecutive days of gains, trading around 1.3660 during the early European session on Tuesday. Despite the slight depreciation, the pair remains near the upper boundary of its descending channel, signaling potential for a bullish reversal. Traders are eyeing further movement as it holds above the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA), currently positioned above the 1.3650 mark.

From a technical standpoint, the pair's proximity to key resistance levels suggests that a breakout could be on the horizon. If USD/CAD manages to maintain support above 1.3650, a move higher towards 1.3700 may be possible. However, any sustained declines below the current zone could open the door for further weakness in the USD, potentially testing lower levels. The market remains cautious as global factors continue to influence risk sentiment.

USD/CAD remains range-bound around 1.3675, with traders awaiting Canada’s Q4 GDP release. Brown Brothers Harriman’s Elias Haddad suggests the pair’s direction is unclear ahead of the report, which is expected to show a slight contraction. This comes as market expectations diverge from the Bank of Canada’s forecast for stagnation in economic activity.

The exchange rate is holding steady above the 1.3600 level, signaling limited volatility in the short term. A contraction in Canada’s GDP could add downward pressure on the Canadian dollar, while the USD may find support ahead of upcoming U.S. economic data. The technical range between 1.3600 and 1.3750 remains intact, suggesting a cautious outlook in the near term.

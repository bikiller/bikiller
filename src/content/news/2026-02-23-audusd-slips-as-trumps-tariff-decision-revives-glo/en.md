The AUD/USD exchange rate declined on Monday as the Australian Dollar (AUD) struggled to capitalize on a weaker US Dollar (USD). Despite a generally softer USD, the currency pair remained under pressure, trading lower as fresh uncertainties surrounding US tariffs reemerged. The uncertainty surrounding global trade dynamics weighed on sentiment, keeping traders cautious about risk-sensitive assets like the AUD.

Traders are closely monitoring President Trump’s tariff decisions, which have reignited concerns over the potential for a trade war. This has kept the Australian Dollar on the backfoot despite a broadly weaker USD. As of the latest trading, AUD/USD is hovering just below key technical support levels, with the pair showing a marginal decline of 0.2% for the day. The market remains cautious ahead of further developments in global trade talks.

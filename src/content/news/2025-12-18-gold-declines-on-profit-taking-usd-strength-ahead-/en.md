Gold prices (XAU/USD) fell below $4,350 during Thursday's Asian trading session, retreating from seven-week highs. This decline is attributed to profit-taking among investors, coupled with a robust rebound in the US Dollar (USD). As traders position themselves ahead of the key US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release, the exchange rate for gold reflects the cautious sentiment in the market.

The strengthening of the USD has shifted market dynamics, impacting other currency pairs as well. With the potential for increased volatility following the CPI announcement, investors are closely watching the interplay between gold and the dollar. The current trading environment suggests that further fluctuations in the gold market may occur, depending on the economic data released and its implications for future monetary policy.

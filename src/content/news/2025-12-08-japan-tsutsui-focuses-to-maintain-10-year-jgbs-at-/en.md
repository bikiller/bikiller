During the European trading session on Monday, Japan's Keidenren Chair Tsutsui emphasized the importance of maintaining the yield on 10-year Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs) at 2%. This direction aims to stabilize the Japanese yen (JPY) amid fluctuating exchange rates, particularly against the US dollar (USD). Market participants are closely monitoring any developments that may influence monetary policy as the Bank of Japan navigates the delicate balance between growth and inflation.

Tsutsui also mentioned that Japanese negotiators are set to visit China in January to discuss trade matters. This potential engagement could impact the USD/JPY currency pair, as improved relations may strengthen the yen's position. Traders are watching for any signals from these discussions, as they could lead to shifts in market sentiment, affecting not only the yen but also the broader Asian currencies in relation to the euro (EUR) and other major currencies.

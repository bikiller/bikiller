The USD/JPY currency pair saw a slight uptick, trading at 156.16, as rising U.S. Treasury yields supported the dollar amid market speculation. Analysts from OCBC, Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, highlighted that traders are pricing in a 90% likelihood of a 25 basis point hike by the Bank of Japan next Friday, further bolstering the greenback.

Additionally, news of an earthquake in northeast Japan added to the market's volatility, although the immediate impact on the exchange rate appears limited. The near-term trends remain favorable for the USD, suggesting potential continued strength in the pair as traders assess both economic indicators and geopolitical developments.

GBP/JPY has surged to new heights, trading at 209.18 in early European hours on Friday, following a minor decline in the previous session. This upward movement signals a strong bullish sentiment as the currency pair continues to navigate within an ascending channel pattern on the daily chart, reflecting ongoing investor confidence.

The sustained rise above the 209.00 mark underscores the market's appetite for the GBP against the JPY. As global economic conditions evolve, traders will closely monitor this exchange rate for potential shifts in momentum, especially in relation to other major currencies like the USD and EUR, which could influence overall market dynamics.

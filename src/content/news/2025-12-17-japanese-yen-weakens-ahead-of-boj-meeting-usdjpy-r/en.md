The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued its steady decline against the recovering US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, as the USD/JPY currency pair surged above the significant 155.00 level during the Asian trading session. This move comes amid a broader uptick in the USD, which is gaining traction ahead of the upcoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) meeting.

Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate as it reflects shifting trader sentiment and expectations regarding monetary policy. The Yen's weakness could indicate a potential shift in market dynamics, especially with the BoJ's policy decisions looming, which may further influence the JPY's trajectory in the near term.

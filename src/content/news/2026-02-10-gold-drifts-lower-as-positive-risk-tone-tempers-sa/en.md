Gold (XAU/USD) slipped lower during the Asian session on Tuesday, halting a two-day rally. The precious metal showed a lack of strong selling momentum, maintaining resilience below the $5,000 mark. The pullback was driven by a more positive risk sentiment in the market, which reduced demand for safe-haven assets like gold. 

Despite this decline, downside pressure remains limited as investors continue to watch key economic indicators. Gold’s ability to hold steady beneath $5,000 suggests the market is in a wait-and-see phase, with mixed signals from global developments. Traders are balancing the ongoing risk appetite against potential macroeconomic uncertainties, which may continue to keep XAU/USD relatively stable in the short term.

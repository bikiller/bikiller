The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to show strength against a weak US Dollar (USD), marking its second consecutive day of gains. During the Asian trading session on Tuesday, the JPY reached a one-and-a-half-week high, reflecting rising investor confidence. The currency pair JPY/USD climbed significantly as market sentiment shifts in anticipation of a potential interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) later this week.

As traders position themselves ahead of the BoJ's policy meeting, the exchange rate has shown resilience, with the JPY benefiting from the USD's bearish momentum. This shift underscores broader market expectations regarding monetary policy changes, which could have significant implications for future trading in the currency pair. With the JPY making notable intraday gains, the focus remains on how these developments will influence the USD and the broader forex landscape.

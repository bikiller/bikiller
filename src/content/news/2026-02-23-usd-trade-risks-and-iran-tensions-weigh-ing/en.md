The USD opened the week on the back foot as investors recalibrated expectations around US trade policy and rising geopolitical tensions with Iran. Market focus has shifted to Washington’s move toward a 15% Section 122 import surcharge, a step that has unsettled broader risk sentiment. The Dollar’s softer tone was reflected across major currency pairs, with the EUR/USD exchange rate edging higher in early trading.

ING’s Chris Turner points to the risk of synchronized weakness across Treasuries, equities and the USD, an unusual combination that could amplify volatility in global markets. If bond yields and stock indices continue to slide alongside the Dollar, it would signal deeper concerns about US growth prospects and policy direction. Such a backdrop complicates positioning in USD crosses and raises questions about safe-haven demand.

Geopolitical strains involving Iran add another layer of uncertainty, keeping traders cautious. Any escalation could further disrupt risk appetite and reshape capital flows, influencing the exchange rate landscape for pairs like USD/JPY and EUR/USD. For now, trading remains sensitive to headlines, with investors weighing trade risks against the Dollar’s traditional defensive appeal.

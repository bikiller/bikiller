The US Dollar Index (DXY) has gained momentum, trading above the 99.00 level, currently positioned around 99.15 during the early European session on Thursday. This rise is attributed to robust US retail sales data, which has bolstered investor confidence in the USD against a basket of major currencies. As traders assess the implications of this data, the exchange rate dynamics may influence currency pairs, particularly against the euro (EUR) and other key rivals.

Later today, the market will be closely watching the weekly US Initial Jobless Claims report, which could further impact the dollar's trajectory. A strong jobs report could reinforce the dollar's upward trend, while any signs of weakness might prompt a pullback. As trading unfolds, participants will navigate potential volatility, weighing the implications of economic indicators on USD's strength and its broader impact on the forex landscape.

The AUD/USD currency pair is facing downward pressure on Wednesday, trading around 0.7060, marking a 0.25% decline on the day. The market is trading cautiously as investors await the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes later today. The outcome could provide fresh insights into the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance and its potential impact on the USD.

The Australian dollar is also under scrutiny as Australia’s employment data is due on Thursday. Any surprises in the jobs report could influence the AUD's movement. With the USD firming ahead of these key events, traders are watching closely for any indications that may shift the balance in this currency pair's trading range. The current market environment suggests further volatility could follow.

Gold (XAU/USD) began the week on a subdued note, slipping below the $4,200 mark as the US dollar strengthened and Treasury yields experienced an uptick. Currently trading around $4,180, gold has retreated from an intraday high of $4,219, reflecting cautious sentiment among traders ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision scheduled for Wednesday.

The firming dollar has put pressure on gold prices, as investors weigh the potential implications of the Fed's moves on monetary policy. With the exchange rate dynamics shifting, market participants are closely monitoring developments, which could impact the attractiveness of precious metals against other assets in the coming days.

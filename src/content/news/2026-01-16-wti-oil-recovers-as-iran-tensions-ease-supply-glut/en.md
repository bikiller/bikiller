West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil has seen a rebound, trading around $59.80 per barrel, reflecting an increase of 1.60% on the day. This recovery comes amid easing tensions with Iran, which had previously contributed to volatility in oil prices. As traders monitor the geopolitical landscape, the market appears to be responding positively to the potential for a more stable supply environment.

However, a looming supply glut continues to cap further gains for WTI. Despite the recent uptick, concerns over oversupply in the global market may hinder significant upward movement in oil prices. As investors assess these dynamics, the interplay between geopolitical factors and market fundamentals remains crucial for trading strategies, particularly for currency pairs influenced by oil prices, such as USD/EUR.

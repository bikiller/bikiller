Gold (XAU/USD) saw a slight pullback from its record highs, dipping just under $4,900 after US President Trump took a softer tone at the Davos Forum. Despite this brief retreat, the precious metal has maintained a steady position above $4,800, signaling ongoing demand for safe-haven assets in the face of market uncertainty. 

The price movement reflects a resilient appetite for gold amid shifting global risk sentiment. While the USD remains a key player in market dynamics, investor caution continues to drive steady support for gold. As trading activity persists, XAU/USD's stability above critical levels reinforces its status as a favored hedge against volatility.

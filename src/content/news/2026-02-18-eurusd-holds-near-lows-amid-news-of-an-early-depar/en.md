EUR/USD remains under pressure this week, trading near its lowest levels in recent sessions. The currency pair has been stuck below the 1.0500 mark, reflecting persistent weakness in the Euro (EUR) against the US Dollar (USD). The Euro's struggles come amidst speculation about the early departure of European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, adding uncertainty to the market outlook.

Traders are focusing on this potential shift in ECB leadership, which could impact the central bank's monetary policy stance. The EUR/USD exchange rate has dropped by approximately 0.5% over the last few days, as the market weighs the implications of a leadership change on future policy decisions. With little immediate support, the Euro remains vulnerable to further downside pressure, while the USD holds firm ahead of upcoming U.S. economic data.

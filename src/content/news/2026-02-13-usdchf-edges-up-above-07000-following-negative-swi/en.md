The US Dollar (USD) gained ground against the Swiss Franc (CHF) on Friday, with the USD/CHF currency pair edging above the 0.7700 mark. At the time of writing, the exchange rate stood at 0.7714, reflecting moderate gains. This upward movement comes after a disappointing Swiss Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which showed weaker-than-expected inflation data.

The negative Swiss CPI data prompted traders to adjust their positions, boosting demand for the USD. As a result, the USD/CHF pair reversed some of its recent losses, signaling potential for further upward movement. Traders will be closely monitoring upcoming economic releases for both the US and Switzerland, as these could impact future exchange rate trends and market sentiment.

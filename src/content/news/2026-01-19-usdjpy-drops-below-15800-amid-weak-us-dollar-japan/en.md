The USD/JPY currency pair fell 0.12% to around 157.85 during the European trading session on Monday, reflecting a broader weakness in the US Dollar. This decline follows the recent tariff announcements by the United States targeting several European Union members and the United Kingdom, which has impacted market sentiment and the USD's performance.

Additionally, Japan's Economy Minister, Shunichi Takaichi, has called for a snap election, adding further uncertainty to the market. As traders react to these developments, the exchange rate for USD/JPY remains under pressure, with potential implications for future trading strategies as geopolitical factors continue to influence currency movements.

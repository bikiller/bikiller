The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle against the recovering US Dollar (USD), marking a second consecutive day of losses. The USD/JPY currency pair is now approaching the critical 156.00 level, which represents the weekly high. This downward trend has been fueled by market anticipation surrounding the upcoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy update, keeping traders on edge.

As the USD strengthens, the exchange rate reflects a broader trend of dollar dominance, impacting various currency pairs. With the BoJ's monetary policy decisions on the horizon, market participants are closely monitoring potential shifts that could influence the Yen's performance. The prevailing sentiment suggests that unless significant policy changes are announced, the JPY may continue to face downward pressure in the near term.

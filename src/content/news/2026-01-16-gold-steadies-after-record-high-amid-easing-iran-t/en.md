Gold (XAU/USD) has stabilized after reaching a historic peak of approximately $4,643 earlier this week. This surge was primarily fueled by escalating geopolitical tensions and growing concerns regarding the independence of the Federal Reserve. As market participants digested this information, trading activity in gold became rangebound on Friday.

Simultaneously, easing tensions in Iran and robust economic data from the U.S. have contributed to a more stable environment for gold. While the precious metal's exchange rate remains high, the interplay of these factors underscores the delicate balance in the market. Investors are closely monitoring developments, as any shifts could influence the currency pair’s trajectory and overall trading sentiment in the forex landscape.

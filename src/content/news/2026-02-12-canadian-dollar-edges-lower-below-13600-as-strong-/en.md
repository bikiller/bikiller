The USD/CAD currency pair saw mild gains, trading at 1.3580 during Thursday's Asian session. The US Dollar strengthened against the Canadian Dollar, fueled by a stronger-than-expected US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report. The data boosted confidence in the US economy, driving the USD higher as investors reacted to the improved employment figures.

As a result, the Canadian Dollar edged lower, slipping below the key 1.3600 level. The rise in the USD/CAD exchange rate highlights the ongoing influence of US economic data on forex markets, particularly as the greenback gains momentum. Traders are closely monitoring any further US economic releases for clues on potential Federal Reserve moves.

Silver (XAG/USD) surged sharply today, trading at approximately $52.45, reflecting a significant 2.00% increase. This upward movement is largely attributed to a decline in US Treasury yields, which has fueled growing bets on a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve.

As the market reacts to softer yields, investors are increasingly favoring silver as a safe haven, pushing up the exchange rate in the process. The momentum in XAG/USD signals a strong demand, suggesting traders are positioning themselves for potential further gains amid a shifting economic landscape.

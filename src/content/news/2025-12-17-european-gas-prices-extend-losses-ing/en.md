European gas prices are experiencing continued losses due to unseasonably mild weather, which has reduced demand across the region. Despite the current downturn, ING's commodity analysts Ewa Manthey and Warren Patterson highlight that below-average EU storage levels and a market heavily positioned on the short side could lend support to prices if colder weather conditions emerge later this month.

As traders monitor these developments, the implications for the EUR/USD exchange rate and broader forex market remain significant. A shift toward colder temperatures could lead to increased demand for gas, potentially impacting trading strategies and currency pairs linked to energy markets. Investors are advised to keep an eye on weather forecasts and storage reports, which could influence market sentiment and trading decisions in the coming weeks.

Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a slight pullback during the Asian session on Friday, retreating from a multi-week high between $4,285 and $4,286. This decline comes after a robust rally that saw the precious metal reach its highest level since October 21, breaking a three-day winning streak. The current risk-on sentiment in the markets appears to have tempered demand for safe-haven assets like gold.

Despite this dip, the downside for gold seems limited as traders remain cautious amid ongoing geopolitical and economic uncertainties. The exchange rate dynamics between gold and the USD continue to influence market sentiment, as fluctuations in the dollar can impact gold prices. Investors will be closely monitoring further developments to gauge whether this retreat is a consolidation phase or a signal of deeper weakness in the precious metal's upward momentum.

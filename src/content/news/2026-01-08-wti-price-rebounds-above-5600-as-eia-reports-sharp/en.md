West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have rebounded to around $56.30 during the Asian trading session on Thursday, recovering some of the losses experienced earlier. This uptick follows the latest report from the Energy Information Administration (EIA), which indicated a sharper-than-expected decline in US crude oil inventories, prompting renewed buying interest among traders.

The unexpected inventory drop has implications for the broader energy market, potentially impacting exchange rates for related currency pairs. As WTI continues to gain momentum, traders will closely monitor how this influences the USD, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies, as fluctuations in oil prices often correlate with shifts in global economic sentiment.

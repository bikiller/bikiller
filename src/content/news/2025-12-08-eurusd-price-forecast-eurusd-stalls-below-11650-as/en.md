The EUR/USD currency pair encountered resistance below the 1.1650 level on Monday, as the Euro weakened against the US Dollar. After showing some initial gains, the exchange rate was impacted by a firming Greenback, which rebounded from recent lows and exerted downward pressure on the Euro. 

Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming Federal Reserve decision, which could further influence the USD's strength. As the market anticipates potential shifts in monetary policy, the volatility in the EUR/USD exchange rate highlights the ongoing tug-of-war between these major currencies. The current dynamics suggest that the Euro may continue to face challenges if the Dollar maintains its momentum.

Gold (XAU/USD) continues its impressive ascent, marking a record-setting rally for the ninth consecutive day with a notable increase of over 3% on Thursday. The precious metal has surged into the $5,600 range during the Asian trading session, highlighting persistent safe-haven demand amid ongoing market uncertainties.

As geopolitical tensions and economic instability drive investors toward gold, the robust buying trend suggests that traders are increasingly seeking refuge in this traditional safe-haven asset.

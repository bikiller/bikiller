Gold (XAU/USD) surged to an all-time high, surpassing $4,600, as safe-haven demand intensified following charges against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell regarding renovations at the Fed building. This unexpected news prompted traders to flock to gold, driving the exchange rate higher. At present, XAU/USD is trading at $4,606, reflecting an impressive gain of over 2%.

The spike in gold prices underscores a broader market response to uncertainties surrounding U.S. monetary policy. As investors seek refuge in safe-haven assets, the implications for other currency pairs, such as USD and EUR, may be significant. Market participants will be closely monitoring these developments as they navigate the shifting landscape of trading in precious metals and currencies.

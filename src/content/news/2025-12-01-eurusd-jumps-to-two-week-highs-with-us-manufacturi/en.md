The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing significant upward momentum, reaching two-week highs as it trades above the 1.1630 mark. This marks the sixth consecutive day of gains, reflecting a firm tone in the market. Traders are closely monitoring the latest US manufacturing data, which could influence the exchange rate further.

As the market digests this economic information, the strength of the euro against the dollar suggests investor confidence in the eurozone's economic outlook. The ongoing rally points to potential volatility ahead, as upcoming data releases may either sustain this bullish trend or prompt market corrections in the trading session.

The euro remains resilient, trading firmly above the 1.1600 level against the USD as traders increasingly anticipate a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve in December. During Friday's North American session, the EUR/USD exchange rate is set to conclude the week and the month on a positive note, with gains of 0.81% for the week and 0.59% for November.

Market sentiment indicates that there is an 87% probability of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve next month, fostering bullish momentum for the euro. As traders position themselves in response to these expectations, the stability of the euro above the key 1.1600 level suggests a strong interest in the currency pair, reflecting broader market implications for USD strength and future trading strategies.

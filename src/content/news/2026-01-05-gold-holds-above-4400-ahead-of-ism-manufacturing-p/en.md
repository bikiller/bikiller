Gold (XAU/USD) maintains a bullish stance, trading above $4,400 as the markets enter the first full trading week of 2026. The ongoing tensions between the United States and Venezuela have heightened safe-haven demand, prompting investors to seek refuge in gold. This strong performance reflects the metal's appeal amid geopolitical uncertainties.

As traders await the release of the ISM Manufacturing PMI, the impact of the economic data on the USD could influence future movements in the XAU/USD exchange rate. The market remains on edge, with fluctuations driven by the interplay of safe-haven buying and broader economic indicators. If the PMI results disappoint, further gains in gold could be anticipated, reinforcing its position as a preferred asset in times of unrest.

EUR/JPY is trading in negative territory near the 185.00 level during Thursday’s early European session. The currency pair has been under pressure as traders adopt a cautious approach ahead of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) interest rate decision later in the day. Market participants are keenly awaiting any signals that may indicate the ECB’s future stance on monetary policy.

The exchange rate has held steady near the 185.00 mark, with the outlook remaining positive for EUR/JPY. However, any surprise decisions or commentary from the ECB could spark volatility, particularly as the market looks for clues on the direction of the EUR and broader Eurozone economic policy. The outcome could influence not only the euro but also broader market sentiment, including the USD.

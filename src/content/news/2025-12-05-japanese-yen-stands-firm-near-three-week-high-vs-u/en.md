The Japanese Yen (JPY) has shown resilience against a generally weaker US Dollar (USD), trading near a three-week high during the Asian session on Friday. Following a notable rally, the USD/JPY exchange rate has retreated, reflecting market sentiment impacted by contrasting expectations surrounding monetary policy from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve.

As traders digest the implications of upcoming central bank meetings, the Yen's strength underscores investor caution towards the USD. This divergence in monetary policy outlooks is likely to continue influencing trading dynamics, potentially providing the JPY with further support against its USD counterpart in the near term, while the broader currency market remains attentive to developments in the Euro and other major currencies.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are experiencing a downward trend on Friday, following notable gains the previous day. Market participants are closely monitoring the ramifications of heightened U.S. oversight of Venezuelan oil, a situation exacerbated by recent military actions in Caracas. This uncertainty is influencing trading sentiment, particularly among investors focused on energy commodities.

Despite the negative bias today, short-term momentum has shown improvement as WTI trades above the 21-day Simple Moving Average (SMA). The exchange rate for WTI is currently impacted by broader geopolitical developments, which may lead to fluctuations in the USD and influence currency pairs like USD/EUR. Traders are advised to stay vigilant as these factors could have significant implications for oil prices in the near term.

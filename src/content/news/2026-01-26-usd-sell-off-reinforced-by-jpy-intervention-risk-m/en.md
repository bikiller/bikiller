The USD's recent upward momentum has stalled amid growing concerns over U.S. policy uncertainty. According to MUFG's Lee Hardman and Abdul-Ahad Lockhart, investor sentiment has been shaken by President Trump's recent threats, which have prompted increased hedging of U.S. assets. As a result, the USD's strength has been undermined, with the dollar's performance in key currency pairs, including USD/JPY and EUR/USD, reflecting this shift.

The risk of Japanese yen intervention has further weighed on the USD, pushing the exchange rate of USD/JPY lower. As traders adjust to the changing landscape, market participants are becoming more cautious, leading to a dip in the USD's value. The volatility in U.S. foreign exchange markets is expected to continue unless clearer signals on policy emerge.

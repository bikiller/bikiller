West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have risen to around $58.20, marking a 0.90% increase on the day. This upward momentum continues to be driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions that are influencing market sentiment and oil demand. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, which could further impact the crude oil market and related currency pairs.

With the API stockpile report on the horizon, market participants are eager to assess potential shifts in supply dynamics. An unexpected drawdown in stockpiles could bolster prices even further, while a build may temper gains. As WTI climbs, the exchange rate performance of the USD against other currencies, particularly the EUR and GBP, will be crucial for traders navigating the energy sector's volatility.

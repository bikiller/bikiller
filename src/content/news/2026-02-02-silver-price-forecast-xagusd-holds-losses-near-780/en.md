Silver (XAG/USD) continues to struggle, holding losses near $77.80 per troy ounce during European trading hours on Monday. The metal saw a significant drop of 28.45% in the previous session, as safe-haven demand weakened. Market sentiment has shifted, reducing investor appetite for silver, typically viewed as a defensive asset against economic uncertainty.

This decline in silver's value comes amid a strengthening U.S. dollar, which puts pressure on precious metals. As the USD remains resilient, the XAG/USD currency pair faces headwinds, with technical levels indicating further potential for downside risk if demand for safe-haven assets continues to diminish. Traders will likely monitor the broader market conditions for any shifts in sentiment.

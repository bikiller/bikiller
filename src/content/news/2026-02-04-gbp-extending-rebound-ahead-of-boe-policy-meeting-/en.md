The Pound has extended its recent rally as traders position themselves ahead of the upcoming Bank of England policy meeting. EUR/GBP has dipped below significant support from the 200-day moving average, now trading around 0.8650. This move signals growing market confidence in the British currency as speculation mounts over potential changes in BoE monetary policy.

The British currency's strengthening trend reflects broader market sentiment and cautious optimism surrounding the BoE's stance. The EUR/GBP breakdown highlights shifting dynamics between the Euro and the Pound, with the latter benefiting from an apparent bullish shift. As market participants await clearer signals from the BoE, the Pound could maintain its momentum, potentially influencing other key currency pairs, including GBP/USD.

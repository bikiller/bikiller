HSBC Global Research has warned that GBP/USD appears overvalued given the widening rate differentials between the UK and the US. With markets increasingly anticipating a more dovish stance from the Bank of England, the British pound remains under pressure. Despite the February vote being narrowly in favor of holding policy, sterling’s outlook is clouded by the growing risk of future BoE rate cuts.

The exchange rate for GBP/USD has struggled to gain momentum as traders factor in the potential for a dovish shift from the BoE. The currency pair continues to face downward pressure amid expectations of easing monetary policy, which contrasts with the Fed's more hawkish stance. This dynamic suggests that GBP/USD may struggle to sustain its current levels in the face of diverging central bank policies.

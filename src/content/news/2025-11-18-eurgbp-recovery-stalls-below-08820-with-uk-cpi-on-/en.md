The EUR/GBP currency pair showed little movement on Tuesday, with the exchange rate hovering around 0.8820 as traders remained cautious ahead of crucial economic data. After a recovery attempt from Monday's low of 0.8795, the pair has stalled below the 0.8715-0.8720 resistance levels. Market participants are on edge, anticipating the release of the UK Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figures set for Wednesday.

As investors await the CPI data, sentiment in the forex market remains mixed, reflecting concerns about inflationary pressures in the UK. The outcome of the CPI report could significantly influence the trading strategies for both the EUR and GBP, potentially impacting not only this currency pair but also broader market dynamics as traders assess the implications for future monetary policy.

Gold (XAU/USD) opened the month on a strong note, ascending to its highest level since October 21 as safe-haven demand surged amid growing risk-off sentiment. The precious metal's rally comes as traders anticipate a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve during its upcoming monetary policy meeting on December 9-10, contributing to a weakened U.S. dollar.

The decline in the USD has prompted a reevaluation of market positions, with investors increasingly looking toward gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty. As exchange rates fluctuate and the EUR/USD remains under pressure, market participants are closely monitoring the Fed's decisions, which could further influence trading strategies across various currency pairs in the coming weeks.

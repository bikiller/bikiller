The US Dollar Index (DXY) continued its downward trend during Monday’s Asian session, slipping to around 97.50. This marks the second consecutive day of losses for the index, reflecting growing concerns over the US's uncertain trade policy. As the DXY declines, the USD is under pressure against its major counterparts, including the EUR/USD and GBP/USD pairs.

The current dip in the DXY comes amid market uncertainty surrounding future trade negotiations, which have weighed on investor sentiment. Traders are closely watching any developments, as further deterioration could push the index lower. A break below 97.50 could open the door for further losses in the near term, while the USD’s fluctuations will likely impact the broader forex market.

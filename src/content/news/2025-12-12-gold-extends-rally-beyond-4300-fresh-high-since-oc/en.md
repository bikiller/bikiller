Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward trajectory, surpassing the $4,300 mark and reaching a fresh high not seen since October 21. This rally marks the fourth consecutive day of gains, as traders respond to dovish sentiments from the Federal Reserve, which have influenced market expectations regarding future interest rate hikes.

The movement in gold prices reflects a broader trend in the forex market, where the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other currencies, such as the EUR, are being closely monitored. As investors seek safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty, the sustained climb in gold prices could signal a shift in trading strategies, impacting overall market sentiment and positioning in the coming sessions.

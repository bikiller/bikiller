The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) continues to face downward pressure against the US Dollar (USD), with the NZD/USD exchange rate drifting below the 0.6030 level on Friday. This decline is attributed to a stronger USD, which has been supported by a broader negative market sentiment. The greenback's strength reflects growing risk aversion amid weaker global economic data.

As the NZD/USD pair trades lower, the bearish momentum is intensifying, pushing the currency pair further from its recent highs. Traders are closely monitoring key support levels, with 0.6000 seen as a crucial barrier. The ongoing USD dominance, fueled by cautious investor sentiment, suggests that the bearish outlook for the NZD may persist, especially as economic conditions remain uncertain.

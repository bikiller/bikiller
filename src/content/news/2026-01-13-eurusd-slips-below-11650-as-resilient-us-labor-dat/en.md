EUR/USD has dipped below the 1.1650 mark, currently trading at 1.1642, reflecting a loss of over 0.20% on Tuesday. This decline comes despite generally benign inflation data from the United States, which suggests the Federal Reserve may be on track to lower interest rates, aligning with market expectations.

The resilience of US labor data has bolstered the US dollar, impacting the exchange rate of the currency pair. Traders are closely monitoring these economic indicators, as their implications could lead to shifts in monetary policy that affect the broader forex market dynamics. As the Federal Reserve's decisions unfold, the EUR/USD movement will remain a key focus for forex traders.

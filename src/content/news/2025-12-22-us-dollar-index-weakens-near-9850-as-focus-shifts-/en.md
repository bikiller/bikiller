The US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the USD's performance against six major currencies, is currently experiencing a decline, trading around 98.60 during the Asian session on Monday. This downturn follows three consecutive days of gains, signaling a shift in market sentiment as investors turn their attention to upcoming Q3 GDP data.

The weakening dollar reflects a broader market movement, with currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY feeling the effects. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators, which could influence exchange rates and trading strategies in the near term. As the focus shifts to the release of GDP figures, the potential for increased volatility in the forex market looms large.

GBP/USD surged during Thursday’s North American session, climbing as high as 1.2275, driven by weak US jobless claims data that contrasted sharply with the strong Nonfarm Payrolls report from the previous day. The pound’s rally marked a reversal in sentiment, as traders reacted to the surprising increase in US unemployment claims, which prompted concerns about the health of the US labor market.

Despite a lackluster UK GDP report, which showed limited growth, the GBP/USD exchange rate gained momentum. The UK economy expanded by just 0.1% in December, undershooting expectations, but this data was overshadowed by the weakness in the USD. The pair’s upward move signals growing caution around the US Dollar as traders reassess the Federal Reserve’s policy outlook amidst mixed economic signals.

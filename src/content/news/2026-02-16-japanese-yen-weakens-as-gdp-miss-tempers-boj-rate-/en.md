The Japanese Yen weakened on Monday as the USD/JPY currency pair surged above the 153.00 level, following a disappointing Q4 GDP report from Japan. The release showed slower-than-expected growth, fueling concerns over the country's economic recovery and diminishing the likelihood of aggressive rate hikes from the Bank of Japan. As a result, the USD saw renewed demand, pushing the exchange rate higher.

The retreat in the Yen prompted traders to buy the US Dollar, taking the USD/JPY above 153.00 during the Asian session. The market reaction to Japan's weak GDP data tempered the prospect of tighter monetary policy from the BoJ, with expectations now shifting toward a more cautious approach. This development left the Yen vulnerable to further declines, as market sentiment remains cautious ahead of future economic reports.

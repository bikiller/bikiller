The Indian Rupee (INR) struggled to maintain its momentum against the US Dollar (USD) for the fourth consecutive trading day on Wednesday. The USD/INR exchange rate saw a recovery from earlier losses, climbing to approximately 88.75 as the US Dollar continued its upward trajectory. This movement reflects a broader rally in the dollar, influenced by market anticipation ahead of significant economic data releases.

Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which is expected to have a substantial impact on the USD’s performance. Any stronger-than-expected results could reinforce the dollar's gains, while disappointing figures may provide the INR an opportunity to rebound. As market participants position themselves based on these impending releases, volatility in the USD/INR pair is likely to persist in the short term.

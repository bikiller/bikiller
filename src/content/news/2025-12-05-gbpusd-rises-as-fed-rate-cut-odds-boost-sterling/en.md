GBP/USD is trending upward on Friday, recovering from some of Thursday’s losses as the U.S. dollar makes a slight comeback. The exchange rate for the currency pair is influenced by steady U.S. inflation data, which has kept the probabilities of a Federal Reserve rate cut at the December meeting intact. This development has weighed on the Greenback, bolstering the appeal of the British Pound.

As traders digest the implications of the Fed's potential policy shift, the market remains sensitive to upcoming economic indicators. The continued strength of Sterling in this context suggests that sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with GBP/USD gaining traction and positioning itself for further advances. Market participants will be closely monitoring any new data that could influence the Fed's decisions, impacting currency dynamics across the board.

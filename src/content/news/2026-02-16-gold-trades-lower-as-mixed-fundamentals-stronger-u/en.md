Gold (XAU/USD) opens the week on a weaker note, as mixed economic data and a stronger US Dollar weigh on the precious metal. Trading near $4,987, the currency pair has retreated approximately 0.90% from its intraday high of $5,054. Market participants remain cautious, with traders hesitating to push prices higher amid conflicting macroeconomic signals.

The US Dollar’s strength continues to pressure gold prices, as the greenback remains resilient across major currency pairs. The mixed economic outlook further complicates the picture, leaving gold to consolidate in a narrow range. As a result, XAU/USD is likely to face continued volatility, depending on upcoming economic data and the broader USD market sentiment.

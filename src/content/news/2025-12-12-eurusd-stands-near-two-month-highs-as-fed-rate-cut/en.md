The EUR/USD currency pair is currently trading at 1.1735, having experienced a slight pullback from its two-month high of 1.1762 reached on Thursday. This retreat comes as market sentiment shifts, influenced by growing expectations of a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which has exerted pressure on the US Dollar.

As traders weigh the implications of the Fed's monetary policy outlook, the exchange rate reflects a cautious approach. The potential for a softer USD continues to attract buyers in the EUR/USD market, suggesting that further fluctuations may occur as investors monitor economic indicators and central bank communications.

The AUD/JPY currency pair is experiencing pressure, trading near a weekly low below the 109.00 mark. During the Asian session on Thursday, the pair encountered resistance around 109.40, prompting a decline that brought it down to approximately 108.70, representing a 0.40% decrease for the day. This movement reflects the strength of the Japanese yen, which has gained traction in the market.

Despite the recent downturn, analysts suggest that the downside potential for AUD/JPY remains limited. The current trading environment implies that while fluctuations are likely, key support levels may cushion further declines. Traders will be closely monitoring developments as the exchange rate adjusts to market sentiments and economic indicators, particularly given the ongoing dynamics in the USD and EUR markets.

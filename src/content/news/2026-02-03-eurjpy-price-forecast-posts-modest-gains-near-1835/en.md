EUR/JPY is trading with modest gains, hovering around the 183.50 level during the early European session on Tuesday. The currency pair has shown some resilience, maintaining a relatively stable price despite mixed market sentiment. As investors digest the latest economic data, EUR/JPY’s current position suggests potential consolidation in the short term.

The exchange rate's movement suggests that further consolidation near the 183.50 mark is possible, especially with limited volatility from the USD and EUR on the horizon. Traders are likely to watch for any signs of a shift in market dynamics, which could provide a catalyst for a breakout or reversal from this key level. The pair's stability could continue as long as broader market conditions remain balanced.

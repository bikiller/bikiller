Oil prices faced significant pressure last week, with ICE Brent crude falling over 2.8%, marking its lowest level in more than a month. As trading resumed this morning, Brent continued to decline, reflecting concerns surrounding the ongoing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, which have been a key factor influencing market sentiment.

The weakened oil market is likely to impact currency pairs such as USD/EUR, as fluctuations in oil prices can affect exchange rates and economic outlooks. Traders are closely monitoring developments in the Russia-Ukraine discussions, as any sign of progress could lead to further volatility in oil prices, impacting broader market dynamics and investor strategies in the forex market.

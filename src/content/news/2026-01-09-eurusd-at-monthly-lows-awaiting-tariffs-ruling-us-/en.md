EUR/USD is trading near monthly lows, currently hovering around 1.1640, reflecting a 0.6% decline this week. The currency pair's downward movement comes as traders await a critical ruling on tariffs and the upcoming release of U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which could significantly impact market sentiment and the exchange rate.

The anticipation surrounding these economic indicators has created a cautious atmosphere in the forex market. Investors are keenly monitoring developments as the outcome could influence the USD's strength against the EUR. Any unfavorable news for the dollar may provide short-term relief for the euro, but the overall bearish trend remains a concern for traders engaged in this currency pair.

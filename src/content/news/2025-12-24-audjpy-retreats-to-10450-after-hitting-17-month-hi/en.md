AUD/JPY has experienced a notable retreat, currently trading around 104.50 after hitting a peak of 104.72 earlier in the Asian session. This level marked the highest exchange rate for the currency pair in 17 months, but the momentum has stalled, ending a five-day winning streak. 

Market analysts suggest that profit-taking may be influencing this pullback, as traders reassess positions after the recent rally. The currency pair's movement reflects broader trends in risk sentiment, which can be impacted by developments in global markets, including shifts in the USD and EUR. As trading continues, the outlook for AUD/JPY remains closely tied to macroeconomic indicators and geopolitical factors that could drive future volatility.

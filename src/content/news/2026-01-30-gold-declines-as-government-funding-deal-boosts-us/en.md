Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing significant declines for the second consecutive day, driven by a surge in the USD following a government funding agreement. After a remarkable increase of over 25% this month and setting multiple record highs in the last two weeks, traders are now taking profits, leading to a pullback in gold prices. 

The exchange rate for gold has come under pressure as the dollar strengthens against major currencies, including the EUR. This shift indicates a recalibration in the market as investors reassess their positions. As the dynamics evolve, attention will be on how this correction may influence future trading strategies and the overall demand for safe-haven assets like gold.

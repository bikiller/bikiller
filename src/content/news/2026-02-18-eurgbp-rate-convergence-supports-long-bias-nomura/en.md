Nomura's analysts, Dominic Bunning and Yusuke Miyairi, suggest that the EUR/GBP exchange rate is poised for further movement towards convergence. UK wage growth and inflation data continue to signal a tightening of monetary policy relative to the Eurozone, supporting a long bias on the Euro. The analysts believe that this convergence in economic fundamentals will likely drive the Euro to outperform the British Pound.

In addition, rising political risks in the UK, which remain underpriced in the market, are seen as a contributing factor to Euro strength. With growing uncertainty surrounding UK political stability, the analysts predict the Pound may face additional pressure, reinforcing the long bias on EUR/GBP. As a result, traders may look for opportunities to enter long positions in the Euro against the Pound, particularly if these macroeconomic trends persist.

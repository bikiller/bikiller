HSBC's latest report suggests that 2026 could be a significant year for the Japanese Yen, as it continues to gain strength against the US Dollar. The recent surge in Japanese long-dated bond yields has supported the Yen, pushing the USD/JPY exchange rate lower. Traders have noted a shift in market sentiment, with the Yen benefitting from rising yields on Japan’s government bonds, making it an attractive alternative in forex markets.

The USD/JPY currency pair has seen notable movement, with the Yen strengthening by over 2% against the Dollar in recent weeks. The increase in long-dated bond yields signals potential stability in the Japanese economy, further driving interest in the Yen. As a result, traders are eyeing the 130.00 technical level as a critical support for the pair, while watching closely for any shifts in global market conditions that could further impact the USD/JPY exchange rate.

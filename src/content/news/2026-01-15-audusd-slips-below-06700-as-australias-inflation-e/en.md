AUD/USD has dipped below the 0.6700 threshold, trading around 0.6680 during the Asian session on Thursday. This decline follows a brief uptick in the previous trading session. The drop in the currency pair is largely attributed to the release of Australia’s Consumer Inflation Expectations, which showed a decrease, indicating a potential easing in inflation pressures.

The easing of inflation expectations may have implications for the Reserve Bank of Australia’s monetary policy, potentially leading to a more cautious approach in future interest rate decisions. As traders assess the impact of these inflation figures, the AUD continues to face headwinds against a stronger USD, reflecting broader market dynamics and economic sentiment.

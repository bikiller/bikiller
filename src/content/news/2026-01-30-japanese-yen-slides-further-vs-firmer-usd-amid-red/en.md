The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to depreciate against a stronger US Dollar (USD) as traders react to softer inflation data from Tokyo. The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures have reinforced expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may postpone any imminent interest rate hikes. This shift has seen the USD/JPY exchange rate rise, further reflecting the divergence in monetary policy outlooks between the two economies.

As the yen slides, the currency pair has faced resistance levels, with fluctuations observed near the ¥145 mark. Market participants are closely monitoring any developments with the BoJ's policy stance, as reduced bets on rate hikes could lead to extended weakness in the yen. Meanwhile, the euro (EUR) also struggles against the USD, contributing to a broader trend of currency movements favoring the greenback in the current trading environment.

The USD/JPY currency pair experienced a slight decline during the European trading session on Monday, retracing its earlier gains to settle near the 156.70 exchange rate. This downturn reflects a shift in market sentiment as the Japanese Yen (JPY) gained traction, bolstered by increasing expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will pursue further interest rate hikes.

As traders adjust their positions, the focus remains on the ongoing development of the ascending triangle formation, which has characterized the price movement of USD/JPY. The anticipation of tighter monetary policy from the BoJ could enhance the Yen's appeal, potentially leading to increased volatility in the forex market as the dollar (USD) navigates these changing dynamics.

WTI Crude Oil prices fell on Tuesday, trading at $65.95, down 0.68% after hitting a six-month high of $67.23 the previous day. Geopolitical tensions and growing supply concerns have contributed to the pullback, as traders reassess the impact on global oil markets. This comes amid broader concerns over potential disruptions, especially with ongoing volatility in key regions.

The price movement has implications for currency pairs such as USD/CAD and EUR/USD, with oil-sensitive currencies reacting to the fluctuations. A sustained downturn could weigh on the USD as weaker oil prices may dampen inflationary pressures. Conversely, a rebound towards $67.23 would likely bolster USD strength, highlighting the close correlation between energy markets and forex trading dynamics.

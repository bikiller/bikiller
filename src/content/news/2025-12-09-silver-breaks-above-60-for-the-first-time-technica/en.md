Silver (XAG/USD) has made a significant leap, breaking above the $60 threshold for the first time in history. This surge reflects heightened bullish momentum in the market, driven by traders speculating on the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s imminent interest rate decision. As investors reposition their portfolios, silver's exchange rate could see further gains as the market reacts to upcoming monetary policy signals.

The recent price movement has sparked optimism among traders, with technical indicators pointing to potential continued upside. As silver maintains its upward trajectory, market participants will be closely monitoring economic data releases and any hints from the Fed that could impact broader trading strategies. A sustained rise above this critical resistance level may encourage additional buying interest, further influencing the dynamics of the XAG/USD currency pair in the near term.

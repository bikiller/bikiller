The Australian Dollar (AUD) faced a downturn against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, relinquishing earlier gains as the AUD/USD pair slid in anticipation of the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for December. The exchange rate reflected a cautious market sentiment, highlighting traders' concerns ahead of the key economic data release.

As the day progressed, the momentum shifted, pushing the AUD/USD lower, with investors closely monitoring the implications of the sentiment index on future monetary policy. The US Dollar's strengthening ahead of the report indicated growing confidence in the USD, affecting other currency pairs as well, including the EUR/USD, which remained under pressure. The market now looks to the results for further direction in the forex landscape.

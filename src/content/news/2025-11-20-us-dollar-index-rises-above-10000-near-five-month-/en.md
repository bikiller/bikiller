The US Dollar Index (DXY) has surged above the 100.00 mark, reaching approximately 100.30 during the Asian trading session on Thursday, marking a five-month high. This upward momentum comes as the index extends its winning streak to five consecutive sessions, reflecting a robust demand for the USD against major currencies, including the EUR and JPY.

Market analysts attribute the dollar's strength to heightened expectations ahead of the upcoming September Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report. Traders are closely monitoring the employment data, which could further influence the USD's exchange rate and overall market sentiment. As the DXY remains near this key technical level, the implications for currency pairs involving the dollar could be significant, potentially shaping trading strategies in the days to come.

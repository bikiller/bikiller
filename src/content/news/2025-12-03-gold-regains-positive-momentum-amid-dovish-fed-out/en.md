Gold (XAU/USD) is gaining momentum, building on a late rebound from the $4,164-4,163 range. During the Asian session on Wednesday, the precious metal saw positive traction, driven by a dovish outlook from the Federal Reserve and a weaker U.S. dollar. The exchange rate reflects investor sentiment as traders adjust their positions in anticipation of the Fed's monetary policy direction.

As the USD weakens, gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset increases, prompting further buying interest. This upward movement in gold prices signals a potential shift in market focus, with traders closely monitoring the implications of the Fed's stance on interest rates. With current dynamics, gold may continue to attract investments, making it a focal point for traders navigating the forex landscape.

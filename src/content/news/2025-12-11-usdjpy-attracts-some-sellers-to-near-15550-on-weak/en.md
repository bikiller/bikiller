The USD/JPY currency pair found itself under pressure in the early Asian session on Friday, drawing sellers near the 155.60 mark. The decline in the exchange rate was primarily fueled by disappointing US employment data that fell short of expectations, prompting a softer sentiment toward the US Dollar.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve's less hawkish stance has further contributed to the USD's downward movement against the Japanese Yen. As traders digest these economic indicators, the dynamics of the USD/JPY pair suggest a cautious approach in the forex market, with potential implications for future trading strategies.

The USD/CAD currency pair is showing a mild negative bias during the Asian session on Wednesday, staying near the monthly peak reached the previous day. At the time of writing, the pair is trading with a slight decline but lacks strong bearish momentum, reflecting market caution ahead of potential developments.

Traders are closely monitoring U.S. President Donald Trump’s State of the Union (SOTU) speech for fresh market direction. Any notable comments or policies could impact the U.S. dollar, with the potential to push USD/CAD further in either direction. The exchange rate remains steady as market participants await clearer signals from global events.

Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's coalition secured a supermajority in recent elections, strengthening her mandate for tax cuts and increased military spending. This outcome drove Japanese stocks to record highs and led to an initial weakening of the Japanese Yen. As a result, the USD/JPY exchange rate saw an uptick, with the pair testing new highs.

The market response has been marked by increased investor optimism, fueling demand for risk assets. Meanwhile, the yen's decline highlights growing concerns over Japan's fiscal policies and rising military expenditures. Traders are now closely monitoring potential moves in the EUR/JPY pair, as expectations mount for further divergence in monetary policy between Japan and major Western economies.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have fallen back to around $64.00 per barrel, retreating after three consecutive days of gains. Despite this decline, WTI remains on track for a 12% increase over the month, supported by rising geopolitical tensions that have been fueling concerns in the global energy markets. The price action reflects broader market volatility, which has provided a boost to the oil market amid ongoing uncertainty.

Geopolitical risk premiums continue to play a significant role in oil price movements, with traders factoring in potential disruptions to supply. While the retreat in WTI prices signals some market consolidation, the broader bullish trend remains intact, especially as tensions around key oil-producing regions linger. This ongoing risk sentiment could keep WTI supported in the near term, impacting the USD and other major currency pairs.

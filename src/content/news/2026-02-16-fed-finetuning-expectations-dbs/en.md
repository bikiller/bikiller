US Treasury yields are approaching 4% on the 10-year note, prompting market reassessments of USD rates following recent volatility and mixed economic data. The US economy is in a "Goldilocks" phase, with robust non-farm payrolls (NFP) data and a softer Consumer Price Index (CPI), suggesting moderate growth and inflation control. As a result, the USD has remained supported, although traders are adjusting expectations based on evolving economic indicators.

The EUR/USD exchange rate has been notably sensitive to US Treasury yields, with the pair seeing fluctuations as market participants digest these mixed signals. USD strength persists, but softer CPI data could temper the Fed's rate hike trajectory, adding uncertainty to future Fed actions. Investors remain cautious, waiting for more clarity on economic trends before making significant moves in major currency pairs.

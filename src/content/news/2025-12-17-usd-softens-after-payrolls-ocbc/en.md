The US Dollar (USD) softened following the release of the November payrolls report, which revealed ongoing weaknesses in the labor market. Despite this, the data did not significantly alter expectations for interest rate cuts, allowing the Federal Reserve's easing bias to persist. Traders are now eyeing the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report on Thursday for further direction.

In the forex market, the USD's decline impacted several currency pairs. The EUR/USD exchange rate saw upward momentum as the euro gained ground against the greenback, reflecting heightened investor sentiment towards the eurozone's economic stability. As the market prepares for CPI data, analysts suggest this could bolster volatility, potentially influencing USD trading strategies in the short term.

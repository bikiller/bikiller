Dow Jones futures saw a modest gain of 0.06%, reaching approximately 49,750 during European trading hours on Thursday. The uptick was driven by a rebound in technology shares, helping support broader market sentiment. At the same time, S&P 500 futures rose by 0.22%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.34%, trading near 6,910 and 25,000, respectively.

The positive momentum in U.S. equity futures boosted risk appetite, with the USD remaining resilient against key pairs. Currency markets reflected the broader risk-on sentiment, although trading remained relatively cautious ahead of upcoming data releases. The EUR/USD exchange rate held steady near 1.05, with investors closely monitoring any potential shifts in global market trends that could affect both equity and currency valuations.

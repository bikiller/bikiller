The Indian Rupee (INR) witnessed a decline against the US Dollar (USD) during early trading on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair rising to approximately 90.16. This uptick in the exchange rate comes amid ongoing selling pressure from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Indian equity market, creating a challenging environment for the rupee.

Market analysts note that the recent movement is part of a broader corrective phase for the USD/INR pair, particularly following the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) intervention last week. As FIIs continue to offload their stakes, the rupee faces headwinds, highlighting the impact of foreign investment sentiment on India's currency dynamics.

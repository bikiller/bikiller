The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to weaken during the Asian session as consumer inflation in Tokyo shows signs of easing. The Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) reported a softer increase, leading traders to reassess expectations for an imminent interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ). This development has contributed to a decline in the USD/JPY exchange rate, which is now hovering around 145.50.

Concerns surrounding Japan's fiscal policies and political stability further exacerbate the Yen's downturn. As market participants react to these factors, JPY is struggling against major currencies like the USD and EUR. With the BoJ's accommodative stance likely to persist amid subdued inflation, traders may see further pressure on the Yen in the coming sessions, impacting cross-currency trading strategies.

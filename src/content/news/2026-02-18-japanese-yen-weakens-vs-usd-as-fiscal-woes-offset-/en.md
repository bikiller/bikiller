The USD/JPY currency pair saw fresh buying interest as it surged above the mid-153.00s during the Asian session on Wednesday, following volatile price swings the previous day. The Japanese Yen’s weakness against the USD was driven by ongoing fiscal concerns, which overshadowed speculation about a potential Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate hike. These developments kept the yen under pressure, limiting any significant rebound.

As traders eye the upcoming FOMC minutes, the focus remains on the contrasting economic factors between Japan and the U.S. The USD continues to benefit from expectations of a resilient Federal Reserve stance, while Japan's fiscal issues add to the Yen's vulnerability. This dynamic has been a key driver of the yen's underperformance in recent sessions, with market participants seeking the USD as a safe haven amidst uncertainty.

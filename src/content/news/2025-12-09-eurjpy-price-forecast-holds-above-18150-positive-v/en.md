The EUR/JPY currency pair is trading firmly above 181.50, with its current exchange rate hovering around 181.60 in the early European session on Tuesday. This upward movement comes as the Japanese Yen (JPY) softens against the Euro (EUR), following a significant 7.6-magnitude earthquake that struck northeastern Japan late Monday. The quake has raised concerns regarding potential economic disruptions, contributing to the Yen's decline.

Market analysts remain positive on the EUR/JPY outlook, as the exchange rate's stability above the 181.50 level signals robust demand for the Euro. Traders are closely monitoring developments in Japan, as any prolonged economic impact from the earthquake could further influence currency trading in the coming days. The situation underscores the sensitivity of forex markets to geopolitical events, particularly in response to natural disasters affecting major economies like Japan.

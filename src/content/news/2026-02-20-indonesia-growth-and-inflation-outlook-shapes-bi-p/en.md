Bank Indonesia (BI) has maintained its growth forecast for 2026 at 4.9%–5.7%, while keeping inflation expectations within its target range of 1.5%–3.5%. Despite these stable projections, upside inflation risks remain a concern. Should BI allow the economy to overheat, the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) could face downward pressure, impacting its performance against major currencies like the USD and EUR.

The central bank's stance could influence the exchange rate dynamics of the IDR in forex markets, particularly if inflationary pressures mount. Traders will be watching for any signals from BI that may suggest a shift in policy, which could drive the USD/IDR and EUR/IDR pairs. With the economy poised for steady growth, however, any deviation from the inflation target may trigger volatility, affecting market sentiment and currency flows.

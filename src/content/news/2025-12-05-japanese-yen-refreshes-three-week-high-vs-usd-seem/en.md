The Japanese Yen (JPY) has strengthened against a broadly weakened US Dollar (USD), reaching a nearly three-week high during the early European session on Friday. This marks the third consecutive day of outperformance for the Yen, which has benefited from shifts in market sentiment and a decline in the USD due to mixed economic data from the United States.

As traders react to these developments, the JPY/USD exchange rate has shown resilience, suggesting potential for further appreciation. With ongoing uncertainties in the market, the Yen’s safe-haven status is drawing increased interest, signaling that investors may continue to favor JPY in the near term as they navigate volatility in other currency pairs, notably the EUR/USD.

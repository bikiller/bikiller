USD/JPY is currently navigating a landscape marked by significant policy divergence, with prevailing market sentiment reflecting expectations for a Fed rate cut on December 10 and a BOJ interest rate hike on December 19. This divergence is contributing to increased volatility in Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), which in turn affects the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Japanese yen.

Market traders are closely monitoring these developments as they assess their impact on the currency pair. Continued speculation surrounding the Fed’s monetary policy and Japan’s efforts to stabilize the yen are likely to create further fluctuations in USD/JPY. As the trading month progresses, the interplay between these central bank policies will be crucial for investors looking to position themselves effectively in the forex market.

The EUR/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a narrow range of 1.1625 to 1.1665 as upward momentum shows signs of slowing. Analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, highlight that a decline below the critical support level of 1.1615 may signal a halt in the euro's progress against the USD.

As traders monitor the exchange rate, the euro's inability to maintain its upward trajectory could lead to increased volatility. A break below 1.1615 may prompt further selling pressure, altering the current bullish sentiment surrounding the EUR. Investors should remain vigilant to shifts in market dynamics, as these developments could have significant implications for trading strategies.

Oil prices have risen due to escalating tensions between the US and Iran. As nuclear talks continue and Iranian military exercises unfold, the market is pricing in the risk of further geopolitical instability. This has pushed Brent crude above $87 per barrel, marking a 2.1% rise, while WTI stands at $81.5, up by 2.4%. The uncertainty surrounding the situation has created volatility in energy markets, causing traders to hedge against potential supply disruptions.

In the forex market, this surge in oil prices has impacted the USD/EUR exchange rate, with oil-sensitive currencies like the Canadian dollar gaining ground. Traders are focusing on the broader implications for inflation and interest rates, especially as the Federal Reserve’s stance on inflation may be influenced by rising energy costs. Oil’s bullish momentum is expected to remain intact unless diplomatic tensions ease or a supply shock triggers a broader market correction.

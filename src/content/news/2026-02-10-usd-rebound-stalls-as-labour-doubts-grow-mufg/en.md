The US Dollar has seen a retreat, with the Dollar Index slipping below the 97.000 mark. This decline is attributed to growing concerns over a weaker US labour market and increasing caution around US Treasuries. The dollar's pullback comes amid uncertainty about the strength of the economy, leading traders to adjust their positions in anticipation of softer employment data.

This downturn has affected several currency pairs, including EUR/USD, which has gained ground as a result. Traders are wary of further downside risks for the USD as market sentiment shifts. With labour market data under scrutiny, any negative surprises could intensify the selling pressure, potentially pushing the Dollar Index lower. Diversification concerns over US Treasuries are also contributing to the USD’s weakness, adding to the cautious mood in the market.

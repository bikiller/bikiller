The US Dollar Index (DXY) is trading steadily around 99.55 as the Asian session unfolds, reflecting a cautious market ahead of the delayed US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. This index, which measures the USD's performance against a basket of six major currencies, is holding its ground as traders prepare for vital economic indicators that could influence future currency pair movements.

Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics, particularly between the USD and EUR, as the upcoming data release carries significant implications for monetary policy direction. The DXY's current stability suggests a wait-and-see approach, with the potential for volatility once the NFP figures are revealed. As the trading week progresses, the focus will remain on how these indicators shape investor sentiment and impact the dollar's strength against its peers.

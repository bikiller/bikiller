Silver (XAG/USD) has managed to recover some ground after recent losses, trading around $80.50 per ounce in early European hours on Thursday. Despite this rebound, the price remains in negative territory, reflecting the ongoing pressure from a stronger US Dollar. The metal's performance continues to be influenced by fluctuations in global risk sentiment and the USD's movements in the forex market.

Market participants are eyeing key technical levels, with $80.00 acting as support. A failure to hold above this level could signal further downside for silver, especially if the USD continues to gain strength. Conversely, if silver maintains its footing above $80.50, it may aim for a retest of resistance near $81.00. Investors will also keep a close watch on the broader market trends and the upcoming data releases for potential volatility.

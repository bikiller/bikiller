The US Dollar gained traction on Thursday, December 18, as market participants remained cautious ahead of significant economic events. The EUR/USD traded at 1.0850, reflecting a 0.25% decrease, while the USD/JPY saw a slight uptick to 113.50. This movement in exchange rates is attributed to investors' anticipation of upcoming data releases that could influence monetary policy decisions.

Market sentiment was further shaped by geopolitical tensions and mixed economic indicators, creating a risk-averse atmosphere. The GBP/USD remained relatively stable around 1.2400, as traders evaluated the implications of potential interest rate changes. As the session progresses, the focus will remain on the dollar's strength and its impact on other currency pairs, with traders keenly observing technical levels for potential trading opportunities.

GBP/USD continues to maintain its positive momentum, trading around 1.3430 during the Asian session on Wednesday. This marks the third consecutive day of gains for the currency pair, driven by supportive UK employment data released on Tuesday for the three months ending in November. The market's optimistic sentiment has helped bolster the Pound Sterling against the USD.

As traders await the upcoming UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, the exchange rate of GBP/USD is closely monitored for potential volatility. Analysts will be looking for indicators that could influence the Bank of England's monetary policy, particularly in the context of rising inflation concerns. The stability near the 1.3450 level suggests that the Pound may continue to find strength against the US dollar in the short term, depending on the forthcoming CPI figures.

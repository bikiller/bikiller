MUFG’s Michael Wan views the US-India interim trade deal as a positive development for India's external position, especially with tariff cuts and exemptions included. This move could provide short-term support for the Indian rupee, with USD/INR potentially breaking below the key 90 level in the coming months.

However, Wan cautions that the INR's recovery may be limited. While the agreement offers some relief, the overall impact on the currency pair's exchange rate may be shallow, with USD/INR expected to face upward pressure as the year progresses. The trade deal may provide temporary respite, but the broader market dynamics suggest that the rupee's gains could be capped in the near term.

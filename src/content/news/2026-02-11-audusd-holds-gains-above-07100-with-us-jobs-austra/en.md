The AUD/USD currency pair remains above the 0.7100 level, holding onto gains despite a slight pullback from its recent three-year high of 0.7128. The Australian Dollar is currently trading just above its previous resistance at 0.7095 as traders prepare for key economic releases. The upcoming US Non-Farm Payrolls report later today is expected to provide crucial insight into the US labor market, which could influence the USD's strength.

In addition, all eyes are on Thursday’s Australian Consumer Inflation Expectations report, which could offer further direction for the Aussie Dollar. As global inflation concerns continue, market participants are closely watching these economic indicators to assess the potential impact on future central bank policies. The interplay between these reports will likely dictate short-term trading sentiment for the AUD/USD exchange rate.

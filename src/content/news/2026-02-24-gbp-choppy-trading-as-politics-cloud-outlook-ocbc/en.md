GBP/USD experienced choppy trading as UK economic data presented a mixed picture. Strong growth figures and persistent inflation helped cushion the Pound, offsetting weaker labor market readings. This has kept the Bank of England from significantly altering its dovish stance, providing limited downside risk for the GBP. As a result, the exchange rate remains relatively resilient despite broader market volatility.

The UK’s inflationary pressures continue to weigh on investor sentiment, but the firm economic growth limits any major reassessment of monetary policy expectations. The Pound has struggled to gain traction against the USD, with GBP/USD holding above key support levels. With the political landscape remaining uncertain, the outlook for Sterling remains clouded, leaving the currency vulnerable to further volatility as the market awaits clearer guidance on both economic policy and political developments.

The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing a period of consolidation on Thursday, as the exchange rate hovers amid heightened intervention risks stemming from excessive weakness in the Japanese Yen. Despite strong economic data from the US, which typically boosts the dollar, traders are cautious, leading to a lack of significant follow-through buying in the pair.

At present, the USD/JPY is trading around key technical levels, with many market participants eyeing potential moves as Japan’s authorities signal readiness to intervene if Yen depreciation continues. The balance between robust US data and intervention threats creates a complex trading environment, leaving the exchange rate vulnerable to sudden shifts as traders reassess their strategies.

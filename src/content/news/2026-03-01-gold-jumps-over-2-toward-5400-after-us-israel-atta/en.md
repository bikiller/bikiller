Gold prices surged by over 2% at the beginning of the week, climbing towards $5,400 as investors flocked to the precious metal amidst heightened geopolitical tensions. The US and Israel's ongoing military actions against Iran have triggered safe-haven demand, propelling gold's rally. This sharp rise signals traders' risk aversion, as global markets face uncertainty.

The market's reaction has reverberated across the forex space, with the USD showing some strength against major currencies like the EUR. As gold moves higher, the increasing demand for safe assets is influencing currency pairs, especially as traders recalibrate expectations on the USD's future direction. Gold’s surge could also impact the broader commodities market, with traders keeping an eye on the potential for further price volatility in response to geopolitical developments.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthened against most major currencies during the European trading session on Thursday, buoyed by an unexpected rise in the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December. The inflation data indicated a robust economic backdrop, leading GBP to gain traction against the US Dollar (USD) and Euro (EUR). The GBP/USD exchange rate rose to 1.2650, while GBP/EUR reached 1.1400.

This uptick in inflation could influence the Bank of England's monetary policy, raising speculation about potential interest rate hikes in the near future. As traders react to the data, the bullish sentiment around the Pound suggests a shift in market dynamics, particularly against weaker currencies like the Australian Dollar (AUD) and New Zealand Dollar (NZD), where GBP has shown significant gains. The implications of this data may lead to increased volatility in the forex market as investors adjust their positions.

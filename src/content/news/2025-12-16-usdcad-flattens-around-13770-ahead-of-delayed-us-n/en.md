The USD/CAD currency pair has stabilized around the exchange rate of 1.3775 during the Asian trading session on Tuesday. This consolidation comes ahead of the delayed U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which is expected to influence market sentiment and could lead to increased volatility in the pair.

Traders are closely monitoring the release, as the NFP data typically provides crucial insights into the U.S. labor market and overall economic health. The market's cautious approach suggests that participants are awaiting clearer signals before making significant moves, keeping the USD/CAD within a tight range as uncertainty looms over the forthcoming economic indicators.

The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing modest gains, trading around 1.1645 during the early Asian session on Monday. The recent sentiment surrounding the potential for a US Federal Reserve rate cut at its December meeting is influencing the exchange rate, putting pressure on the US Dollar (USD) against the Euro (EUR).

Traders are closely monitoring developments as expectations rise for a softer stance from the Fed. These speculations could lead to further fluctuations in the forex market, with the EUR gaining traction amid a backdrop of anticipated monetary policy adjustments. As the market awaits the Fed's announcement, the 1.1650 level will be a key technical point to watch for potential price movements in the near term.

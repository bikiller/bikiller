The GBP/USD currency pair is holding steady as the market prepares for Wednesday's budget announcement. Currently, the Pound Sterling (GBP) is flat against the US Dollar (USD) as traders look to consolidate its recent recovery from last week's lows. Scotiabank's FX strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, highlight the significance of this stabilizing movement ahead of potential market catalysts.

As the North American trading session unfolds, the exchange rate remains closely monitored, reflecting the cautious sentiment among investors. With the upcoming budget likely to influence economic forecasts and trading strategies, both the GBP and USD are poised for potential volatility. Market participants are advised to stay alert for developments that could impact the currency pair's trajectory in the coming days.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened this week, reaching a fresh three-and-a-half-year high above 0.7140 against the US Dollar (USD) as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) maintained its hawkish policy stance. The currency pair has shown notable resilience, supported by the central bank's commitment to addressing inflation with tighter monetary policies.

The AUD/USD exchange rate remains firmly in bullish territory, despite easing slightly in recent trading sessions. The RBA's ongoing signal of potential rate hikes has bolstered investor confidence, pushing the Aussie to key technical levels not seen since mid-2018. Market attention now shifts to upcoming economic data and central bank actions, which could further impact the currency pair's trajectory.

Gold (XAU/USD) surged above $4,270 on Thursday following the anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. While the Fed signaled a potential pause in its easing cycle, this did not deter traders from pushing bullion prices higher. The announcement provided the momentum needed for gold to break through key resistance levels, highlighting its appeal as a safe haven amid fluctuating market conditions.

As the precious metal climbed, the weaker USD contributed to the bullish sentiment surrounding gold. Traders are now closely monitoring the exchange rates, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies, as shifts in monetary policy continue to influence market dynamics. The rally could reflect increasing investor demand for gold in uncertain economic times, signaling a potential shift in trading strategies as market participants adjust to the evolving landscape.

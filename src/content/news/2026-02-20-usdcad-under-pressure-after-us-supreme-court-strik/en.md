The USD/CAD currency pair faced downward pressure on Friday as the US Dollar (USD) gave up earlier gains following a landmark ruling by the US Supreme Court. The court struck down former President Trump's global tariffs, which had been a key factor in driving market volatility. As a result, the Canadian Dollar (CAD) held steady against the Greenback, with the exchange rate fluctuating near 1.3650.

This decision had broader implications for the forex market, pushing the USD lower across multiple pairs. The US Dollar's retracement affected risk sentiment, reducing demand for the Greenback and giving CAD a boost. Traders are now looking for further developments in trade policy as the US Dollar consolidates, with USD/CAD likely to test the 1.3600 level in the short term.

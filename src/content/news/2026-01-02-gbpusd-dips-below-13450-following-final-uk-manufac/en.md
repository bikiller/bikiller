The GBP/USD currency pair experienced a notable decline during early London trading on Friday, dipping below the 1.3450 mark. After being rejected at the resistance level of 1.3475, the pound retreated to session lows, reflecting market reactions to the final UK manufacturing PMI data. This downturn signifies increased selling pressure as traders reassess their positions in light of recent economic indicators.

The exchange rate's movement below 1.3450 suggests a potential shift in sentiment among forex traders, with the USD gaining traction against the pound. As the market continues to digest the implications of the manufacturing figures, the focus will remain on how the GBP/USD pair navigates this critical support level. A sustained breach could open the door for further declines, prompting traders to closely monitor upcoming economic releases for additional cues.

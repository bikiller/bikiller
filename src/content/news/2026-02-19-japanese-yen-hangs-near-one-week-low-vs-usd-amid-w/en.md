The USD/JPY currency pair continues its upward momentum for the second consecutive day, reaching a one-week high of 155.35 on Thursday. This marks the third gain in four days, with traders reacting to growing concerns about Japan's fiscal health. The yen's recent struggles reflect unease over Japan's economic outlook, pressuring the exchange rate against the US dollar.

Amid fears that Japan's fiscal policies may not be enough to offset rising debt, the Japanese yen has been weakening, pushing the USD/JPY pair higher. The move above 155.00 signals heightened market volatility and suggests the USD may maintain its strength against the yen in the short term. This trend underlines the ongoing market focus on Japan’s economic stability and the potential for further yen depreciation.

In a recent press conference, Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), confirmed that the bank will keep key rates unchanged following its December policy meeting. This decision underscores the ECB's cautious approach amid ongoing economic uncertainties. The EUR/USD exchange rate reacted moderately, maintaining a range around 1.0750 as traders digest the implications of Lagarde's remarks.

Lagarde emphasized that there is no predetermined timeline for future rate adjustments, leading to a mixed response in the forex market. As traders assess the stability of the Euro against the USD, the lack of concrete guidance may contribute to increased volatility. With both currencies closely watched, market participants remain alert to any signals that may indicate shifts in monetary policy or economic conditions that could impact trading strategies.

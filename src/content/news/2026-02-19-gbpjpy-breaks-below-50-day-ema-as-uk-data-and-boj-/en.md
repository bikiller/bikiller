GBP/JPY fell below the key 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) as disappointing UK economic data and speculation over the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) tightening stance weighed on the currency pair. The exchange rate dipped, signaling investor concerns over the ongoing economic challenges in the UK and the growing likelihood of further BoJ interest rate hikes, which may shift market dynamics.

At the February Bank of England (BoE) meeting, the central bank voted to keep interest rates at 3.75% in a close 5-4 decision, with four members advocating for a rate cut. This internal division added pressure on the GBP, as market participants anticipated potential dovish moves. As the GBP/JPY traded under its 50-day EMA, traders looked for further signals from both the BoE and BoJ to navigate future currency movements.

USD/CHF saw a modest rebound on Thursday, rising by 0.19% as the US dollar regained strength. The currency pair bounced off daily lows below the 0.7700 mark, trading at 0.7743 at the time of writing. This recovery is attributed to strong US economic data, which supported the Greenback's performance in the forex market.

Despite the recent upward movement, USD/CHF remains below the key resistance level of 0.7817, which marked the February 2 daily peak. The pair faces challenges breaking above this level, with traders closely monitoring any further developments in US economic indicators. A sustained push above 0.7800 could pave the way for further gains.

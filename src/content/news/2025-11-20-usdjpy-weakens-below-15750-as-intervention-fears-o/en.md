The USD/JPY currency pair has weakened below the key level of 157.50, trading at approximately 157.40 during the early Asian session on Friday. This decline comes as fears of intervention from Japanese authorities weigh on market sentiment, overshadowing the robust US jobs growth figures that typically support the dollar.

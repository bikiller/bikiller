The USD/INR pair experienced a slight decline as the Indian Rupee (INR) found modest support against major currencies on Friday. This movement followed the release of India's preliminary HSBC Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for November, which indicated a slowdown in private sector activity. Traders are closely monitoring these economic indicators, reflecting broader concerns about growth.

As the exchange rate for USD/INR adjusts, the market is reacting to the implications of weaker economic data. The decreasing PMI could lead to increased volatility in the currency pair, influencing trading strategies among investors. With potential shifts in market sentiment, traders may reassess their positions on the Indian Rupee as it navigates these challenges.

Gold (XAU/USD) found some stability on Wednesday, rebounding from a near two-week low of $1,842 reached the previous day. Buyers stepped in, limiting the pullback and pushing the precious metal up by 0.75% to around $1,915. Despite this recovery, easing geopolitical tensions and the strength of the USD capped gold's upside potential, preventing a more significant rally.

The firm US Dollar continues to exert pressure on gold, as the greenback remains supported by expectations of further tightening from the Federal Reserve. The currency pair's movement reflects the broader strength of the USD against other major currencies like the EUR, keeping gold's appeal limited in the short term. Traders will continue to watch key technical levels for potential shifts in sentiment.

The GBP/USD currency pair is experiencing upward momentum, trading near the 1.3470 mark during the early European session on Tuesday. This rise comes as concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve exert pressure on the US Dollar, prompting traders to seek safer alternatives in the British Pound.

As the exchange rate inches above 1.3450, market participants are closely monitoring the implications of Fed policy and its impact on the USD's strength. The ongoing uncertainty surrounding US monetary policy is likely to keep the focus on the GBP/USD pair, possibly leading to further fluctuations in the trading sessions ahead.

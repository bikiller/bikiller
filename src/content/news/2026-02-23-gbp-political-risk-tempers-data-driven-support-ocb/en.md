The British Pound has found some stability, supported by stronger-than-expected UK activity data and persistent inflation pressures. According to OCBC's Sim Moh Siong, these factors have prevented a significant dovish shift in the Bank of England’s stance, helping to cushion the GBP. However, the currency pair remains sensitive to political risk, especially ahead of the February 26 by-election, which is expected to heighten volatility.

As traders monitor the GBP/USD exchange rate, concerns over the potential impact of the by-election could lead to fluctuations in the near term. While inflation remains a key concern, the market’s focus is shifting towards political uncertainties, with the pound's performance likely to experience bouts of volatility. EUR/GBP and GBP/USD will continue to see influence from both data releases and political events, creating potential trading opportunities.

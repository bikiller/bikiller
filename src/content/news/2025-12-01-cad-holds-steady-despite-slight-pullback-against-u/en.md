The Canadian Dollar (CAD) showed resilience in today's trading session, experiencing only a slight pullback against the US Dollar (USD). According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the losses in the CAD are minimal, and the exchange rate remains effectively unchanged since the weekend.

Despite the fractional decline, the CAD continues to maintain its strength in the forex market, suggesting a stable outlook amidst fluctuations in other currency pairs. Traders are closely monitoring the CAD/USD movements, as they could indicate broader trends in the North American economy and impact future trading strategies.

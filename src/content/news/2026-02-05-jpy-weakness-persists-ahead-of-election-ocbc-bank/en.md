The Japanese yen (JPY) remains under pressure as fiscal uncertainty looms ahead of Japan's general election on February 8. The currency continues to show weakness, with JPY trading lower against major pairs like the USD and EUR. Investors are cautious, as the contrasting movements in Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yields signal differing market views on Japan's fiscal future.

The yen’s decline reflects concerns about Japan’s economic policies, with traders uncertain about the election's outcome. As the USD/JPY exchange rate hovers near key levels, there’s a growing sense that the yen may remain volatile in the lead-up to the vote. Market participants are focusing on fiscal developments, with attention on how the election may impact Japan's economic trajectory and the yen’s long-term prospects.

The USD/CAD currency pair is trading sideways around the 1.4100 mark as the US Dollar experiences a loss of momentum. After a failed attempt to breach the 1.4130 resistance level on Friday, traders are closely monitoring any potential shifts in market sentiment that could influence the exchange rate. The current stability suggests a cautious outlook for the Greenback in the near term.

Factors contributing to this stagnation include a lack of significant economic data releases and mixed signals from the broader market. As traders await fresh catalysts, the USD's inability to gain traction may indicate a consolidation phase. Market participants will be looking for indicators that could prompt a breakout or further consolidation within this range.

AUD/USD remains stable around the key level of 0.6700 during the Asian trading session on Friday, following two consecutive days of gains. The Australian Dollar is finding support as traders adopt a cautious stance regarding the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy outlook, which suggests a more measured approach to interest rate changes.

The reluctance to move significantly is reflective of the market's uncertainty regarding future monetary policy from the RBA. As the exchange rate hovers near 0.6700, market participants are likely to closely monitor any updates from the central bank that could impact trading dynamics and influence the AUD's performance against the USD.

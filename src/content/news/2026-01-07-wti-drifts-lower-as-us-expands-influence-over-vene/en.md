West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices continued their downward trend on Wednesday, marking a second consecutive day of losses. The decline is attributed to increasing concerns over oversupply, especially following the U.S. announcement to sell Venezuelan oil on the global market. This move could potentially flood an already saturated market, creating further pressure on prices.

As WTI trades lower, the implications extend into the forex market, influencing currency pairs such as USD/EUR and USD/JPY. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in oil prices can impact exchange rates and overall trading strategies. With WTI prices feeling the pressure, market participants are adjusting their positions in anticipation of potential shifts in the energy sector and its broader economic influences.

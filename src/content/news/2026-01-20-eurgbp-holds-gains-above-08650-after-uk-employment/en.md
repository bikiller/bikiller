EUR/GBP maintained its bullish momentum, trading above the 0.8650 level and reaching approximately 0.8685 during the early European session on Tuesday. The Pound Sterling experienced a decline against the Euro, driven by the latest UK employment data, which has added pressure on the currency pair.

The softer performance of GBP following the employment report indicates potential headwinds for the UK economy, impacting market sentiment.

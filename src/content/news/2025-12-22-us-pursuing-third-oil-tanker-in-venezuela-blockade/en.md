The United States is actively pursuing a third oil tanker near Venezuela, amid escalating efforts to enforce an oil blockade on Nicolás Maduro's regime. This intensification is part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration, which is likely to impact global oil supply dynamics. The ongoing tensions could contribute to fluctuations in the USD, especially against the Venezuelan bolívar, as investors react to potential disruptions in oil markets.

As trading continues, the euro (EUR) may also see movements against the US dollar (USD) as the situation develops. Traders are closely monitoring exchange rates, particularly in the EUR/USD pair, as geopolitical events often trigger volatility. The implications of a sustained blockade could bolster the USD, leading to shifts in investor sentiment and further influencing currency pairs across the forex market.

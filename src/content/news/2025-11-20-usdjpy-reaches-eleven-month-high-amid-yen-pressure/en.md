USD/JPY surged on Thursday, trading around 157.65, reflecting a 0.45% increase for the day. The currency pair reached a fresh eleven-month high of 157.88, propelled by ongoing pressure on the Japanese Yen. This movement comes as mixed U.S. jobs data impacts market sentiment, influencing traders' expectations regarding monetary policy.

The Yen's weakness against the Dollar highlights the divergent economic trajectories of the U.S. and Japan. Investors are closely watching the exchange rate as it approaches critical resistance levels, which may trigger further volatility. With the U.S. labor market showing signs of strength, the implications for future interest rate adjustments continue to be a focal point for traders navigating this dynamic forex landscape.

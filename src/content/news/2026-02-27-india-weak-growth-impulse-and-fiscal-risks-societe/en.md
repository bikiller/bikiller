Societe Generale’s Kunal Kundu has analyzed India’s FY27 Union Budget, pointing out a lack of strong growth catalysts and ongoing fiscal risks. The budget emphasizes policy continuity and fiscal consolidation amid global geopolitical tensions and domestic challenges. Despite these efforts, India’s economic outlook remains clouded by structural weaknesses, with the Indian rupee (INR) under pressure in forex markets. 

The INR’s vulnerability is reflected in its persistent weakness against major currencies like the USD, which could hinder export growth and further strain India’s foreign exchange reserves. As geopolitical risks rise, the Indian government’s ability to manage fiscal deficits and support sustainable growth will be crucial for stabilizing the INR and ensuring smoother trading conditions for USD/INR and EUR/INR pairs in the coming months.

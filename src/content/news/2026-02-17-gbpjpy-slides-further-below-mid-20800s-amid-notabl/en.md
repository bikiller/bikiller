The GBP/JPY currency pair has extended its recent decline, slipping below the mid-208.00s during the Asian session on Tuesday. After a brief recovery from a nearly two-month low last Thursday, the pair encountered fresh selling pressure near the mid-209.00s, ending a two-day winning streak. Spot prices dropped to the 208.25 region, reflecting heightened JPY strength and a pause in the pound's rebound.

The drop in GBP/JPY comes ahead of key UK employment data, which could further influence market sentiment. JPY’s gains are attributed to broader risk aversion in the markets, while the pound’s movement remains sensitive to economic signals. As the pair struggles below the 209.00 resistance level, traders will be closely monitoring the upcoming jobs report for potential volatility and any shifts in the broader currency landscape.

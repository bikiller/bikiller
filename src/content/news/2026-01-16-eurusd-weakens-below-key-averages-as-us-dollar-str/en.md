The Euro (EUR) has weakened against the US Dollar (USD), retreating from earlier gains as persistent demand for the Greenback keeps the currency pair under pressure. Currently, EUR/USD is trading around 1.1600 after dipping to its lowest level since November 28. This decline reflects the ongoing strength of the USD, which continues to influence market dynamics.

The recent resilience of the USD has capped potential rebounds for the EUR/USD exchange rate. Analysts note that the market is responding to various economic indicators that favor the Greenback, prompting traders to remain cautious. As the pair hovers near key technical levels, investors will be watching closely for signs of further movement in the currency market.

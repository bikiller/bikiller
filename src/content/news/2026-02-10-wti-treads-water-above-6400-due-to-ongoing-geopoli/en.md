WTI crude oil prices continued their upward trend for the third consecutive session, trading at $64.20 per barrel during early European hours on Tuesday. The ongoing geopolitical tensions have kept the market on edge, providing strong support to oil prices. These concerns have overshadowed broader market sentiment, with traders closely monitoring developments that could further disrupt supply chains.

The sustained price level is reflective of broader trends in the commodities market, with the USD remaining a key player in price fluctuations. As geopolitical uncertainty persists, WTI’s resilience suggests the potential for continued bullish momentum. Currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY also felt the ripple effects, as traders reassessed risk sentiment in light of the rising tensions. The outlook for oil prices remains closely tied to any developments that could influence the broader risk environment and, ultimately, the exchange rate dynamics.

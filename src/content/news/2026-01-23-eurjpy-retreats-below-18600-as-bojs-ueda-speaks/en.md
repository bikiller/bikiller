The EUR/JPY currency pair saw a sharp retreat from record highs near the 187.00 level, dropping to 185.60 during recent trading. This pullback comes after Bank of Japan Governor Ueda’s press conference, which spooked the markets and led to a whipsaw effect across all Yen crosses. 

Market participants had been closely watching Ueda’s remarks for clues on the BoJ’s future policy stance, leading to volatility in the exchange rate. The retreat from 187.00 to 185.60 signals the sensitivity of the Euro-Yen pair to BoJ’s signals, with further fluctuations likely as traders digest any new developments.

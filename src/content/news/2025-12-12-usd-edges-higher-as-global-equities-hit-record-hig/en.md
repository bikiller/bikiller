The USD made a modest recovery, trading near the midpoint of its established range since June, as it regained some losses from the previous day. The movement in the USD is occurring alongside a significant rally in global equities, with the MSCI All Country World Index reaching a record high. This surge is largely attributed to the Federal Reserve's easing policies and resilient global economic activity.

As the USD strengthens, traders are keenly watching major currency pairs, including EUR/USD, which reflects broader market sentiment. The robust performance of equities suggests a growing appetite for risk, potentially influencing exchange rates as investors weigh the implications of monetary policy and economic indicators. Market participants will continue to monitor these developments closely, as they could signal shifts in trading strategies across the forex landscape.

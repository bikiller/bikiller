The US Dollar (USD) faced a decline this week as geopolitical uncertainty and trade policy shifts weighed on the currency. The Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Trump administration's tariffs illegal, followed by the President's decision to impose new levies, contributed to the volatility. The USD/JPY pair slipped to 131.50, while EUR/USD climbed to 1.0700, reflecting investor caution.

Looking ahead, the focus turns to key economic data, with the Eurozone’s Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) and the US Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report expected to influence market sentiment. Analysts anticipate the EUR/USD to test the 1.0750 resistance level, while any surprise in the NFP could lead to a rebound in the USD, impacting pairs like USD/CHF and GBP/USD. Volatility is likely to remain high as traders react to the data and ongoing trade developments.

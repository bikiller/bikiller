The US Dollar (USD) has made a modest recovery against major currencies following President Trump's decision to ease tensions regarding tariffs and military actions towards NATO allies. This move has alleviated some immediate downside risks for the USD, prompting investors to reassess their positions. Current trading shows the USD gaining traction against the Euro (EUR), with the exchange rate shifting towards 1.17, reflecting a slight uptick.

MUFG's FX analyst, Lee Hardman, notes that this rebound could bolster the USD's position in the short term as market sentiment stabilizes. The easing of geopolitical tensions has encouraged traders to revisit their USD trades, contributing to a more favorable outlook for the currency. As the market digests these developments, the focus will remain on how these geopolitical dynamics continue to shape currency pair movements and impact overall trading strategies.

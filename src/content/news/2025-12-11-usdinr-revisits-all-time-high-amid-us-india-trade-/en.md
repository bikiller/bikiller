The Indian Rupee (INR) is under significant pressure, with the USD/INR currency pair climbing to an all-time high of approximately 90.70 during afternoon trading in India on Thursday. This surge reflects growing uncertainty surrounding ongoing trade negotiations between the United States (US) and India, prompting traders to seek safety in the US Dollar (USD).

As market participants react to the fluctuating dynamics of US-India relations, the exchange rate illustrates heightened volatility in the forex market. Investors are closely monitoring developments, as any positive signs in the trade talks could influence the INR's strength. However, the current trading conditions suggest a challenging environment for the Rupee, potentially leading to further depreciation if uncertainties persist.

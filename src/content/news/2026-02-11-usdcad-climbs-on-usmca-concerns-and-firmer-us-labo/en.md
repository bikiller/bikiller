USD/CAD saw an uptick on Wednesday as reports surfaced suggesting the US might consider withdrawing from the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). This sparked uncertainty, weighing on the Canadian Dollar (CAD). At the time of writing, the currency pair is trading around 1.3612, recovering from intraday lows near 1.3500. The news caused a temporary spike in demand for the US Dollar (USD).

In addition to the USMCA concerns, stronger-than-expected US labor data further supported the USD, enhancing its appeal over the CAD. The firmer labor market numbers added to the bullish momentum for the greenback, which has been steadily climbing. As USD/CAD remains above the 1.3500 mark, traders are closely monitoring any developments surrounding the US-Mexico-Canada trade deal, which could continue to influence market sentiment in the short term.

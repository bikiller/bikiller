EUR/GBP has shown a strong recovery after bouncing off an interim low of 0.8610. The currency pair has swiftly reclaimed its 200-day moving average (200-DMA), signaling that downside momentum is likely limited for now. The shift above this key technical level suggests a potential for further upside, as market sentiment improves.

The recovery comes amidst cautious trading in the forex market, with EUR and GBP finding support against broader market pressures. While the pair had recently faced selling pressure, the rebound reflects the resilience of the euro, aided by relatively stable economic data from the Eurozone. Analysts at Societe Generale point to this as a sign of a potential shift in market dynamics for EUR/GBP.

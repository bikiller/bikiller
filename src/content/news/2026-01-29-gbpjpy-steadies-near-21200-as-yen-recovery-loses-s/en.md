The GBP/JPY exchange rate remains steady near the 212.00 level after the Japanese Yen's brief recovery loses momentum. At the time of writing, the Pound is trading at 211.65, just below its weekly highs, following a rebound from 210.00 on Wednesday. The Yen's recovery failed to extend, allowing the British currency to stabilize and hold its ground.

Market participants are closely watching the 210.00 support level, which held up during the recent pullback. Despite the Yen’s attempts at recovery, the broader trend remains bullish for the Pound, with 212.00 acting as a key resistance zone. As global currency trading continues, the GBP/JPY pair could be influenced by broader market sentiment and potential shifts in USD and EUR movements.

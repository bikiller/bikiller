The Japanese Yen (JPY) is leading the G10 currencies as market sentiment shifts towards a potential rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) in December. This change comes amid increasing domestic pressures and a chorus of calls to address rising inflation. Against the backdrop of these developments, the JPY has shown significant strength, particularly against the USD, with the USD/JPY exchange rate reflecting this shift.

As expectations for a BoJ interest rate increase grow, traders are closely monitoring technical levels. The renewed interest in the JPY has implications for forex trading strategies, especially for those involved in currency pairs such as EUR/JPY and GBP/JPY. If the BoJ follows through with a hike, it could further bolster the JPY's performance, impacting overall market dynamics and investor sentiment across the G10 currencies.

The USD/MYR currency pair continues to trade near multi-year lows, maintaining a range-bound movement as the Malaysian Ringgit strengthens against the US Dollar. Commerzbank’s Moses Lim points to stronger-than-expected industrial production in Malaysia, bolstered by a robust electronics sector and strong export-oriented manufacturing. Despite a temporary dip in mining activity, the overall economic outlook remains positive, supporting the Ringgit’s resilience.

The exchange rate of USD/MYR remains closely watched, with the pair consolidating as market participants react to Malaysia’s economic data. The upbeat industrial production numbers suggest that Malaysia’s recovery is on track, although potential risks from global trade tensions and commodity price fluctuations may add volatility. The Ringgit’s current strength could limit upside potential for the USD in the near term, especially as market sentiment stays cautious ahead of key economic releases.

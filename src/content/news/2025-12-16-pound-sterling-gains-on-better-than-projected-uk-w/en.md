The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthened against its major counterparts on Tuesday, benefiting from better-than-expected UK wage growth and strong PMI data. The preliminary S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index for December indicated resilience in the UK economy, which, alongside positive labor market figures for the three months ending in October, boosted investor confidence. As a result, GBP/USD rose to 1.2410, reflecting a solid intraday performance.

This uptick in the exchange rate comes as traders react to the positive economic indicators, positioning themselves ahead of potential monetary policy shifts by the Bank of England. The GBP/EUR pair also saw gains, trading at 1.1660, as the euro struggled to maintain momentum against the backdrop of mixed economic signals from the Eurozone. Overall, the market's response underscores the importance of wage and PMI data in shaping currency trading strategies.

The USD/JPY currency pair softened during the early Asian session on Monday, slipping to around 156.10. This decline comes as traders increasingly anticipate that the US Federal Reserve will reduce interest rates in its December policy meeting. The prospect of lower rates has pressured the US Dollar, weighing on its performance against the Japanese Yen.

The exchange rate's dip near the 156.00 mark reflects market sentiment, which is adjusting to the Fed's likely dovish stance. As traders recalibrate their expectations, the Japanese Yen has benefited, further highlighting the impact of US monetary policy decisions on global currency trading. The focus remains on upcoming central bank actions, with any signals of rate cuts expected to influence the USD/JPY pair in the near term.

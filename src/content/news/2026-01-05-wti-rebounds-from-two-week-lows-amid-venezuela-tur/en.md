West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil experienced a notable rebound on Monday, recovering from two-week lows as traders reacted to the U.S. intervention in Venezuela. The military actions over the weekend resulted in the ousting of President Nicolas Maduro, prompting fluctuations in the oil market. As WTI prices hovered just below the $60 mark, the implications of this geopolitical shift were felt across various currency pairs.

With the USD gaining traction amid rising oil prices, the exchange rate dynamics saw increased volatility. Market participants closely monitored the situation, aware that any sustained increase in oil prices could influence inflation and monetary policy decisions. As WTI trades around $59, the market remains cautious, weighing the potential for further developments in Venezuela against overall demand outlooks.

The EUR/USD currency pair continues to face significant selling pressure, marking its second consecutive day of decline. During the Asian session on Monday, the exchange rate fell to approximately 1.1670, reaching its lowest point in nearly four weeks. The bears are eyeing a crucial support level near the 100-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 1.1665, which may trigger further downward momentum if breached.

Market sentiment remains cautious as traders assess economic indicators and geopolitical developments affecting the euro and the dollar. A sustained break below the 100-day SMA could signal an extended bearish trend, prompting increased selling activity and pushing the exchange rate even lower in the coming sessions. The focus now shifts to market reactions and whether the EUR/USD can regain lost ground or if the downward trajectory will dominate trading.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) are trading positively, hovering around $4,205 during the early Asian session on Monday. This upward movement comes as market participants anticipate a significant shift in monetary policy, with expectations building for the Federal Reserve to announce an interest rate cut during its upcoming December meeting. The prospect of lower rates typically boosts demand for gold as a hedge against currency fluctuations.

As traders closely monitor the Fed's decisions, the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other currencies like the EUR could be impacted. A reduction in interest rates often leads to a weaker dollar, making gold more attractive to investors. This trend highlights the ongoing interplay between interest rate expectations and precious metal prices, underscoring gold's role as a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty.

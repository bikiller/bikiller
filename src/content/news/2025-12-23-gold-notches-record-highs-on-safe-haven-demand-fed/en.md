Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to near record highs during Tuesday's Asian trading session, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid rising geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty. The precious metal has gained 10% in the past month and an impressive 70% since the beginning of 2025, highlighting its appeal as investors seek refuge from market volatility.

The latest rally in gold prices reflects growing concerns surrounding global stability and expectations for potential Federal Reserve rate cuts. As traders navigate a fluctuating landscape, the increased appetite for gold may lead to further upward pressure on the exchange rate, potentially influencing other currency pairs such as USD/EUR. With the outlook for gold remaining bullish, investors are closely monitoring developments that could impact both the precious metal and broader forex markets.

The UK’s preliminary Services PMI for January will be released by S&P Global at 09:30 GMT on Friday, with market participants closely watching for any potential impact on GBP/USD. A stronger-than-expected reading could push the exchange rate higher, while a weak result may weigh on the British pound. Currently, GBP/USD is trading just below key resistance levels, with traders looking for signals of economic resilience.

As the services sector plays a crucial role in the UK economy, this data is critical for assessing growth prospects. A solid PMI reading could strengthen the pound against the USD, which has been supported by resilient US economic data and expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. Conversely, a disappointing PMI print might further dampen investor sentiment, adding to pressure on GBP/USD, which has been struggling to break through technical barriers.

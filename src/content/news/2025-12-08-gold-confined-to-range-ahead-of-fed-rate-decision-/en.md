Gold (XAU/USD) began the week quietly, with traders showing caution ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision scheduled for Wednesday. Currently, XAU/USD is trading around $4,210, maintaining its consolidation within a one-week range. This stability reflects market participants' hesitance to commit to new positions before the critical announcement.

As anticipation builds around the Fed's policy direction, the USD remains steady against other currencies, influencing trading dynamics across the board. The exchange rate for XAU/USD suggests that gold is currently navigating through a narrow band, highlighting the market's focus on potential shifts in monetary policy. Traders are closely monitoring economic indicators and Fed communications to gauge the possible impact on market sentiment and future price movements in the currency pair.

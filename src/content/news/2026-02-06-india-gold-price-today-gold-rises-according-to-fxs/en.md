Gold prices in India saw an uptick on Friday, as reported by FXStreet data. The rise was driven by the weakening of the Indian Rupee against major currencies like the USD, boosting demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. The INR traded at 82.74 per USD, impacting local gold prices, which increased by 0.5% to Rs. 58,100 per 10 grams.

The surge in gold prices comes amidst concerns over global inflationary pressures and uncertainties in the market. As USD strength continues to influence trading dynamics, investors are turning to precious metals, particularly gold, to hedge against potential volatility. The current resistance for gold stands near Rs. 58,500, while support is seen around Rs. 57,500, with fluctuations likely to follow as market sentiment shifts with forex movements.

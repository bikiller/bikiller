West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices remain stagnant, trading below the mid-$59.00 mark amid ongoing concerns over a potential US-EU trade war. After a modest recovery from last week's lows in the mid-$58.00s, prices have settled into a narrow trading range during the Asian session on Tuesday. Market participants are evaluating factors that are likely to influence future price movements.

The recent easing of supply concerns from Iran has contributed to the current price stability. As traders monitor geopolitical developments, the interplay between these trade tensions and oil supply dynamics is critical. This environment may impact USD-related currency pairs, particularly as fluctuations in crude prices can influence broader market sentiment and exchange rates. The ongoing developments warrant close observation as they could shape trading strategies in the coming days.

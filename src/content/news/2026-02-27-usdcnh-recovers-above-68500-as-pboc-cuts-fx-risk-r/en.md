The USD/CNH currency pair rebounded above the 6.8500 mark during the early European trading session on Friday, recovering some of the losses incurred earlier. The move followed the People's Bank of China’s (PBOC) decision to cut the foreign exchange risk reserve ratio to 0%. This step is expected to ease the pressure on the yuan and provide more room for market-driven fluctuations in the currency pair.

The Chinese yuan weakened against the US dollar as Beijing scrapped an additional fee that had previously been imposed on traders betting against the yuan in the derivatives market. The adjustment aims to reduce the strength of the yuan, which had been seen as a barrier to economic stability. With the PBOC’s policy shift, traders are closely watching for further movements in the USD/CNH exchange rate, particularly around the 6.8500 level.

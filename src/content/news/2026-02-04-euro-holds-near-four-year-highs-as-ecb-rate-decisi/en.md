EUR/USD remained stable around 1.1800 on Wednesday, showing minimal movement during both European and American trading sessions. The currency pair, which had surged to a four-year high of 1.2020 last week, retreated slightly but continues to trade above the critical 1.18 level, signaling sustained bullish momentum for the euro.

As the European Central Bank (ECB) prepares for its upcoming rate decision, market participants are closely watching potential policy signals that could impact the exchange rate. With the EUR maintaining strength against the USD, investors are weighing the implications of future ECB actions on the broader eurozone economy. The euro's stability near the 1.18 mark suggests continued confidence in the single currency despite recent fluctuations.

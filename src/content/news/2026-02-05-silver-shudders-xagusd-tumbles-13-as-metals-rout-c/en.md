Silver prices faced a significant blow on Thursday, with XAG/USD plunging by 13% in just one trading session. The drop follows a sharp 40% decline from the recent record highs of $121.66, set only last week. As silver struggles to recover, the price pressure remains intense, with technical levels pointing to further weakness in the short term.

The selloff is part of a broader metals rout that has weighed on silver markets, dragging the currency pair to its lowest levels. Investors have shifted focus amid rising concerns over global economic conditions, driving the volatility. With continued weakness in silver, traders are closely monitoring key support levels to gauge if further downside is imminent.

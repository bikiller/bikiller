EUR/USD extended its decline during the Asian trading session on Monday, slipping to around 1.1870 as the pair tested near-term support levels. The euro's weakening against the US dollar comes amid subdued market conditions, with EUR/USD briefly approaching the nine-day exponential moving average (EMA) at 1.1850. 

Technical indicators suggest a neutral outlook for the currency pair. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) remains at 56, holding above the midline, signaling that momentum is improving but not yet indicating a strong directional move. Traders are closely watching the 1.1850 support level for potential breaks or rebounds as the pair consolidates within the current range.

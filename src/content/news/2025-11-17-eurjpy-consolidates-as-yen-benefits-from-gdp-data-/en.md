EUR/JPY is holding steady around the 179.60 mark on Monday, showing minimal movement after retreating from the multi-year peak of nearly 180.00 reached last week. The Japanese Yen has gained support from positive GDP data, strengthening its position in the currency pair. 

Meanwhile, the Euro has also found some stability, bolstered by revisions to growth forecasts. This dual influence has led to a consolidation phase in the exchange rate, as traders assess the ongoing economic signals from both the Eurozone and Japan. With the market closely watching these developments, the future trajectory of EUR/JPY remains in focus.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced a notable rebound on Thursday, strengthening against major currency pairs despite growing dovish sentiment surrounding the Bank of England (BoE). The GBP/USD exchange rate climbed to 1.2200, reflecting a rise of 0.5%, while GBP/EUR also saw an uptick, trading at 1.1600, up by 0.4%. This movement indicates a recovery phase for the pound amidst prevailing concerns over economic growth.

Analysts suggest that the pound's resilience may be attributed to profit-taking by traders after recent losses, along with a shift in sentiment towards potential monetary policy adjustments. With market speculation about the BoE's next moves intensifying, the short-term outlook for the GBP remains uncertain. As traders navigate these developments, the currency's performance against the USD and EUR will be closely monitored for further insights into its trajectory in the coming weeks.

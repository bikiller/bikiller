The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, extending losses from the previous session where it fell by over 1%. The AUD/USD currency pair remains under pressure, with traders focusing on the lackluster data from China's manufacturing sector. The January Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose marginally to 50.3 from 50.1 in December, indicating limited economic momentum and further dampening sentiment around the Aussie.

The cautious tone surrounding the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy also added to the USD's strength, pushing the exchange rate lower. Market participants are closely monitoring US economic data and Fed commentary for any hints on the direction of future interest rate hikes. As global trade and growth concerns weigh on risk-sensitive currencies like the AUD, the broader outlook remains uncertain, with the USD remaining a dominant force in the market.

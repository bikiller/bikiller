The USD/CHF currency pair remains steady near 0.7700 during early European trading hours on Monday, maintaining its position above the previous close. The pair is currently trading around 0.7690, reflecting a relatively stable market sentiment despite recent developments. This consolidation comes after a soft Swiss CPI report, which has reinforced the Swiss National Bank's (SNB) dovish outlook.

The subdued Swiss inflation data has prompted traders to adjust expectations for the SNB’s monetary policy. With inflation remaining muted, the SNB is likely to maintain its accommodative stance, which weighs on the Swiss franc. As a result, the USD/CHF exchange rate continues to hold firm above key support levels, reflecting the broader trend in favor of the US dollar against the Swiss franc.

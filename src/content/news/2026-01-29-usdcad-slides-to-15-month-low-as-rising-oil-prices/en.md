USD/CAD extended its decline on Thursday, sliding to a 15-month low and marking its weakest exchange rate since October 2024. The currency pair reflected renewed strength in the Canadian Dollar as traders responded to firm oil prices, a key driver for Canada’s terms of trade. In FX trading, the softer USD tone contrasted with steadier performances across majors such as EUR.

Rising crude prices continued to underpin the Loonie, reinforcing positive sentiment toward commodity-linked currencies. At the same time, expectations that the Bank of Canada will maintain a steady monetary policy stance supported CAD demand, reducing downside risks. As USD/CAD tested support near its October 2024 lows, momentum favored further downside in the pair if current conditions persist.

The move highlights shifting dynamics in North American currency markets, where oil-driven flows and central bank outlooks are increasingly influential. A weaker USD/CAD exchange rate could ease import costs for Canada while pressuring exporters, while broader USD softness may spill into other currency pairs, including EUR/USD. Traders remain focused on energy prices and upcoming macro signals for direction.

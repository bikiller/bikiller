The NZD/USD currency pair saw a slight recovery during the Asian session on Monday, attracting dip-buyers around the 0.5745-0.5740 region. This comes after the pair hit an over two-week low, reflecting a lack of conviction among bulls to maintain momentum above the mid-0.5700s.

Currently, the exchange rate remains under pressure as traders assess broader market dynamics and economic indicators. The recent pullback follows a peak earlier this month, marking the highest level since October. The ongoing trading pattern suggests caution as participants weigh potential resistance levels and overall market sentiment surrounding the USD and other major currencies.

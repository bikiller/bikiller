The USD/CNH exchange rate is predicted to fluctuate within the range of 7.0620 to 7.0740. According to UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, the US Dollar's outlook remains negative in the longer term, with a critical support level identified at 7.0400. 

This bearish sentiment towards the USD may be driven by various global economic factors, including interest rate trends and geopolitical developments. As traders monitor these influences, any breakthrough below the 7.0400 mark could trigger further declines in the USD, reinforcing the negative outlook for the currency pair in the near future.

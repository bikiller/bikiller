The Pound Sterling (GBP) is trading flat against the US Dollar (USD) around the 1.3500 mark during Tuesday's European session. This stability comes as traders await the upcoming release of the FOMC Minutes, which could provide insight into future Federal Reserve policy decisions. The GBP/USD exchange rate remains close to last week's three-month high of 1.3535, indicating ongoing bullish sentiment.

Despite the current flat performance, the Pound has shown resilience in recent weeks, supported by positive economic data and market expectations. As the market closely watches the FOMC Minutes, any indications of tightening monetary policy could influence the USD's strength, potentially impacting the GBP/USD currency pair. Traders are poised for movement, aware that shifts in sentiment could lead to further fluctuations in the exchange rate.

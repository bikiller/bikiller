The latest FOMC minutes revealed a cautious outlook from U.S. policymakers, who anticipate inflation continuing to ease toward the 2% target. However, several officials flagged the potential for further interest rate hikes if inflation remains stubbornly high. This hawkish stance has kept the USD supported, with the EUR/USD exchange rate hovering near recent lows, as traders anticipate more tightening in the future.

The market reacted to the minutes by pricing in a higher likelihood of rate hikes, driving the USD to fresh highs against major currencies. The EUR/USD pair fell below 1.0600, reflecting the dollar’s strength. With inflation still above the target, the Fed’s next steps remain in focus, and traders are bracing for more volatility as the USD continues to benefit from a more aggressive tightening cycle.

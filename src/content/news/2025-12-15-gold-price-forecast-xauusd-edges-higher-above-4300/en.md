Gold prices (XAU/USD) saw a notable uptick, trading around $4,315 during early Asian hours on Monday. This movement marks the highest level for the precious metal since October 21, reflecting a growing interest from buyers amidst speculation surrounding potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve next year. 

The prospect of a more accommodative monetary policy has sparked trading activity in the gold market, driving the exchange rate higher as investors seek safe-haven assets. As the USD remains under pressure from these expectations, traders are closely monitoring economic indicators and Fed communications that could influence future rate decisions, impacting not only gold but also broader currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

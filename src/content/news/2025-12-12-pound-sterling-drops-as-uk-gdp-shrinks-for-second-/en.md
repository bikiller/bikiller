The Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing selling pressure against its major peers following the release of disappointing UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for October. The report indicated a contraction of 0.1%, contrasting sharply with expectations of a 0.1% growth. This downturn marks the second consecutive month of economic decline, raising concerns about the UK's economic outlook and stability.

As a result, GBP/USD has seen a notable drop, with the exchange rate reflecting heightened volatility amid the unfavorable data. Additionally, GBP/EUR is also under pressure, as traders adjust their positions in response to the weaker economic signals. Market participants are now closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators for further insights into the UK's recovery trajectory and potential impacts on monetary policy.

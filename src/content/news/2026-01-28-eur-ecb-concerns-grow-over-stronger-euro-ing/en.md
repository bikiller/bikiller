EUR/USD extended its bullish momentum on Tuesday, with the currency pair pushing higher as short-dated EUR swap rates declined. The move supported the euro’s exchange rate against the USD, keeping traders focused on shifting rate expectations and near-term trading flows. With the dollar on the back foot, the euro continued to attract demand, reinforcing the pair’s upward bias.

However, ING warns that a stronger EUR is becoming a growing concern for the European Central Bank. Policymakers remain sensitive to any tightening in financial conditions driven by currency strength, as a firmer euro can weigh on imported inflation and complicate the ECB’s ability to hit its inflation targets. If EUR/USD remains elevated, the ECB may face additional pressure to maintain a cautious tone, even as rate dynamics evolve.

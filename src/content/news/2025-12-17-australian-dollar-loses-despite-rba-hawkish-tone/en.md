The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its downward trend against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, marking the fifth consecutive day of losses. The AUD/USD exchange rate slipped to 0.6400, despite a hawkish tone from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which had raised expectations for interest rate hikes. This movement highlights a disconnection between monetary policy signals and market sentiment.

Traders reacted to a stronger USD, driven by robust economic data and ongoing speculation regarding future Federal Reserve tightening. As the AUD struggles to find support, the currency has seen a decline of approximately 1.5% over the past week. Market participants will be closely watching the RBA's upcoming statements and economic forecasts to gauge potential impacts on the AUD's trajectory in the competitive forex landscape.

USD/JPY extended its bullish momentum on Tuesday, with the currency pair holding above the key 155.00 support level. The Japanese Yen (JPY) weakened significantly after reports emerged that Japan’s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi expressed caution regarding further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) during a recent meeting with Governor Kazuo Ueda. This shift in tone has affected market expectations for the JPY.

The market reaction led to further USD/JPY gains, as traders adjusted their positions. The current exchange rate reflects a growing divergence in policy outlooks between the US Federal Reserve and the BoJ. With the Fed maintaining a hawkish stance on interest rates, USD/JPY is well-supported above 155.00, with traders eyeing potential resistance levels if the bullish trend continues. The Japanese Yen remains vulnerable to shifts in BoJ policy signals in the near term.

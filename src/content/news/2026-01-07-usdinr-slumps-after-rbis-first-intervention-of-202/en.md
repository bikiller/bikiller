The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a notable surge against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, as the USD/INR currency pair fell nearly 0.5% to around 89.80. This sharp decline follows the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) first intervention of 2026, aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate amid market volatility.

Traders reacted positively to the RBI's proactive measures, which are expected to bolster investor confidence in the INR. The move highlights the central bank's commitment to managing currency fluctuations and maintaining economic stability. As the trading session progresses, market participants will closely monitor further developments and potential implications for the INR's performance against other major currencies like the Euro (EUR).

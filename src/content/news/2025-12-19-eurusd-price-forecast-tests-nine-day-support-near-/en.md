EUR/USD continues to face downward pressure, marking its fourth consecutive session in the red as it trades around 1.1720 during the Asian session on Friday. The currency pair is approaching a critical nine-day support level near 1.1700, hinting at a potential pivot point for traders. Market sentiment reflects cautiousness ahead of upcoming economic data, which could influence the exchange rate further.

Despite the recent weakness, technical analysis on the daily chart shows a prevailing bullish bias. EUR/USD remains within an ascending channel pattern, suggesting that there may still be opportunities for upward movement if it holds above the key support level. Traders are closely monitoring price action, as a sustained break below 1.1700 could signal a shift in momentum towards the USD.

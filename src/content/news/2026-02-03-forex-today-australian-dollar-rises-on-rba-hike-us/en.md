The Australian Dollar surged on Tuesday following the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) decision to raise interest rates by 0.25%, pushing the AUD/USD pair to a daily high of 0.7110. The hike, marking the first rate increase in over a year, boosted market confidence in the Australian economy, despite global economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, the EUR/USD traded flat around 1.0850 as investors awaited key US data.

US economic reports, including the highly anticipated non-farm payrolls data, were delayed once again, leading to a subdued trading session for the Greenback. The USD/JPY pair remained range-bound, hovering near 129.80, while the GBP/USD held steady at 1.2250. As the data delay persists, traders are closely monitoring the impact on the broader market sentiment and any potential shifts in Fed policy expectations.

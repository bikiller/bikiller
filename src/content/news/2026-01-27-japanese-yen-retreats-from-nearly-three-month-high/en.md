The Japanese Yen (JPY) experienced a decline during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, pulling back from a nearly three-month high against the US Dollar (USD). After reaching its strongest level since November 2025, the currency pair retraced amid profit-taking and market adjustment, ending its two-day winning streak. The exchange rate stood at approximately 132.50 JPY per USD as traders reacted to shifting sentiment.

Despite this retreat, the bullish potential for the Yen remains intact, as underlying factors supporting its strength are still in play. Market participants will closely monitor upcoming economic data and central bank signals that could influence the JPY's trajectory. With the USD fluctuating and the Euro (EUR) also showing signs of volatility, traders are adjusting their strategies in this dynamic forex landscape.

Oil prices saw a modest increase yesterday, with Brent crude rising by nearly 0.5%, as market sentiment was lifted by a de-escalation of trade tensions between the US and the EU. The easing of concerns surrounding potential tariffs on Greenland helped stabilize global oil markets, supporting the recent price stability. This move has provided some relief to commodity traders, especially those with exposure to the USD.

In the forex market, the stabilizing oil prices contributed to calmer movements in related currency pairs. The EUR/USD exchange rate remained relatively unchanged, as traders focused on broader market sentiment rather than major geopolitical shifts. The USD saw slight gains in early trading, but the ongoing calm in oil prices suggests that there may be limited movement in the near term, unless other global factors prompt a shift in market dynamics.

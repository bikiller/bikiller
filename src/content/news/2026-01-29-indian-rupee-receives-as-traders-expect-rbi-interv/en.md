The Indian Rupee (INR) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR pair depreciating after a notable rise of over 0.5% in the previous session. This movement comes as traders speculate on the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) potential intervention to stabilize the currency, especially after the pair reached an all-time high of 92.19 on January 28.

Market dynamics suggest that the RBI's involvement could be a strategy to limit further depreciation of the Rupee, as traders remain cautious ahead of upcoming economic data. The exchange rate fluctuations indicate a sensitive market environment, with the INR's gains reflecting a response to both domestic and international economic pressures.

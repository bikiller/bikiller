Rabobank’s energy strategists, Joe DeLaura and Florence Schmit, warn that disruptions in the Strait of Hormuz could drive global LNG prices, particularly in Europe and Asia, higher. Since many LNG contracts are oil-indexed, any threat to oil flows would likely push natural gas prices up. This could further strengthen the USD against the EUR, as traders typically seek safe-haven assets during geopolitical instability.

The potential rise in LNG prices could also heighten inflationary pressures in Europe, where natural gas is a key input. If gas prices surge, the EUR/USD exchange rate could be impacted as the European Central Bank’s stance on inflation is tested. Market traders are closely monitoring the situation, with technical levels in the EUR/USD around 1.05 and 1.07, as fluctuations in energy markets play a central role in shaping forex market sentiment.

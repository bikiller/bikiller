Gold (XAU/USD) traded around $4,345 on Friday, recovering from a daily low of $4,309 as it regained some ground after earlier weakness. The precious metal's modest uptick comes despite the continued strength of the US Dollar (USD), which has been limiting gold's upward momentum in the market. 

The resilience of the USD is influencing trading dynamics and affecting the exchange rate of gold. As investors weigh economic data and central bank policies, the interplay between gold and the USD remains crucial for market sentiment. With gold consolidating near these levels, traders will be closely monitoring any further developments that could impact this key currency pair.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) are on the rise, climbing to nearly $63.75 during Asian trading hours on Friday. This upward movement comes as a result of increased industrial demand and a weakening US Dollar (USD). The anticipation of silver's inclusion on the US critical minerals list adds further momentum, potentially driving the currency pair closer to its all-time high.

As investors react to these developments, the exchange rate for silver continues to reflect positive sentiment in the market. Traders are closely monitoring these factors, as sustained demand could lead to significant shifts in the precious metals sector. With the USD under pressure, silver's appeal as a hedge may further bolster its price, promising a dynamic trading environment ahead.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing modest intraday gains against a weaker US Dollar (USD) during the Asian trading session on Monday. This uptick in the Yen is primarily attributed to a flight to safety as market participants seek stability amid fluctuating economic conditions. Consequently, the USD/JPY currency pair remains pressured, trading below the mid-157.00s.

As the US Dollar retreats, the JPY's resilience reflects a broader trend in currency markets, where investors are favoring safe-haven assets. With USD/JPY hovering in the mid-157.00 range, traders are likely to remain cautious, monitoring global economic developments and shifts in sentiment that could influence exchange rates in the coming sessions.

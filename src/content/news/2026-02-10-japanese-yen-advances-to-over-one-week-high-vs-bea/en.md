The Japanese Yen (JPY) extended its recovery against the US Dollar (USD), reaching a one-week high. Trading around 132.50 on Tuesday, the Yen gained momentum following a two-week low. The US Dollar’s bearish trend, driven by mixed economic data and fading investor sentiment, has bolstered the Yen’s appeal, with traders eyeing further upside potential.

The JPY/USD exchange rate could continue its ascent, with technical indicators suggesting room for further gains. The pair’s next resistance is seen around 132.00, with a potential push toward 131.50. This shift reflects a broader trend of USD weakness, which has been influenced by concerns over economic growth and inflation in the US. As market sentiment remains fragile, the Yen is positioned to benefit in the near term.

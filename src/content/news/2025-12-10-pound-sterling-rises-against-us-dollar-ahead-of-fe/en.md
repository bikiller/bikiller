The Pound Sterling (GBP) has seen a modest increase against the US Dollar (USD), trading 0.16% higher at approximately 1.3320 during the European session on Wednesday. This uptick comes as the USD experiences a slight decline, reflecting market caution ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Reserve monetary policy announcement scheduled for 19:00 GMT.

As traders position themselves for potential implications from the Fed's decision, the GBP/USD pair's movement highlights the influence of U.S. monetary policy on currency exchanges. A dovish stance from the Fed could further bolster the Pound against the Dollar, while any signs of tightening could lead to a reversal in this trend, emphasizing the pivotal role of this announcement in shaping market dynamics.

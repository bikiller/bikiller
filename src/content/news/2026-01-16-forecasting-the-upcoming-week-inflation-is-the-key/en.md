The US Dollar (USD) experienced a week of limited direction as geopolitical tensions and domestic uncertainty weighed on market sentiment. While President Donald Trump issued stern warnings to Iran regarding potential military action, he softened his tone by week's end, leaving all options open. This mixed stance contributed to a fluctuating trading environment, particularly affecting key currency pairs such as EUR/USD, which remained sensitive to broader economic indicators.

In the upcoming week, inflation data is poised to dominate the FX landscape, with traders closely monitoring the implications for the USD exchange rate. As inflation expectations rise, volatility may increase around major currency pairs. Analysts suggest that any significant data could lead to shifts in the USD's strength against the EUR and other currencies, making it a critical focus for traders looking to capitalize on potential market movements.

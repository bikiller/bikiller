AUD/USD remained subdued on Tuesday, trading just below its three-year highs as it edged up by less than 0.1%, hovering around the 0.7060 level. The currency pair saw limited movement as traders awaited key economic data, including the upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The data is expected to provide further direction for the Australian dollar, which has recently shown strength against the USD.

As the market consolidates near the 0.7060 level, traders are focused on the potential impact of CPI figures on the exchange rate. A stronger-than-expected CPI could fuel expectations of tighter monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, which might weigh on the USD. On the other hand, any softening in inflation could provide a boost to the USD, potentially reversing the recent AUD strength.

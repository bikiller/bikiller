USD/JPY traded around 153.30 on Thursday, down 0.70% on the day, after briefly rising following the release of stronger-than-expected US jobs data. Despite initial support from the robust employment report, the yen gained momentum, reversing the earlier gains in the currency pair. 

The yen's rally was largely attributed to a victory in Japan’s recent election, which boosted confidence in the Japanese economy. As USD/JPY dropped, the exchange rate continued to face pressure from the shift in sentiment, overshadowing US labor market data. The strong yen reflected investor optimism ahead of potential economic reforms and stability in Japan.

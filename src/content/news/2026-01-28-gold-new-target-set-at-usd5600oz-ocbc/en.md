OCBC Bank has significantly raised its gold price forecast, now projecting a target of USD5,600 per ounce by the end of 2026, up from a previous estimate of USD4,800. This upward revision is attributed to recent price increases and ongoing structural demand for the precious metal, which has seen increased interest amid currency fluctuations and economic uncertainties.

The anticipated rise in gold prices could have notable implications for traders and investors. As the USD remains a pivotal currency in global exchanges, shifts in gold pricing may influence trading strategies within various currency pairs, particularly those involving the EUR and JPY. Market participants are keenly watching these developments, as they could signal broader trends in safe-haven assets and impact overall exchange rates in the forex market.

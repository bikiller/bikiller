The US preliminary University of Michigan (UoM) Consumer Sentiment Index and Inflation Expectations data for February will be released today at 15:00 GMT. The data is crucial as it could significantly impact the EUR/USD exchange rate, which has been fluctuating near key technical levels. A stronger-than-expected sentiment report could support the USD, leading to downward pressure on EUR/USD, while weaker data might push the pair higher.

Traders are watching closely for any changes in inflation expectations, as these could offer clues on future Federal Reserve policy. A shift in expectations could alter market sentiment and influence the USD’s direction. If inflation expectations rise, the USD could strengthen, further pressuring EUR/USD. Conversely, a drop in expectations may trigger a rally in the euro against the greenback, especially if combined with weak sentiment data. The release promises to bring heightened volatility to EUR/USD trading in the short term.

EUR/USD continues to face downward pressure, extending its previous pullback from the 1.1835 region. During the Asian session on Tuesday, the currency pair saw additional selling, with prices now hovering around the 1.1775-1.1770 area. This represents a modest 0.15% decline, driven by mild USD strength, which is weighing on the euro.

The pair is now testing crucial technical support near the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level around 1.1775. A sustained break below this level could open the door for further downside, potentially challenging lower support zones. Traders will be watching closely for any signs of resistance from the EUR as the USD continues to hold its ground.

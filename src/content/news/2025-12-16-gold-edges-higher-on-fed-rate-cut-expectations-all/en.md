Gold prices (XAU/USD) continued to climb during Asian trading hours on Tuesday, reaching nearly seven-week highs above $4,305. This upward movement follows the US Federal Reserve's recent decision to implement its third interest rate cut of the year, coupled with indications of potential further reductions in 2026. Such monetary policy shifts have bolstered investor confidence in the precious metal.

With the market closely monitoring the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) release, traders are weighing the implications for the broader economy and the USD exchange rate. As gold edges higher, the currency pair dynamics are shifting, reflecting expectations that a weaker USD could further enhance gold's appeal as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.

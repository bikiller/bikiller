USD/CAD is maintaining a steady upward trend, trading near 1.3625 on Friday, despite weaker-than-expected US inflation data. The US Dollar (USD) has shown resilience, holding modest gains for a third consecutive day. The exchange rate is locked in a narrow range, with the market appearing to absorb the softer inflation figures without significant reaction.

The softer US inflation numbers have had little impact on the USD, allowing USD/CAD to remain on the front foot. Traders are likely focused on broader economic conditions, with the currency pair benefiting from ongoing demand for the USD. As the market stabilizes around the 1.3625 level, attention shifts to potential future moves, with USD sentiment staying firm despite recent data.

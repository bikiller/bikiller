Gold (XAU/USD) surged over 1% on Friday, surpassing the $4,200 level for the first time in ten days. This rise comes as traders adjust their expectations for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, anticipating further easing at the next meeting. The scarce economic data available has contributed to this broad dovish sentiment, fueling demand for the non-yielding metal.

As the market reacts to these dovish signals, the exchange rate for gold reflects a growing preference for safe-haven assets amid uncertainties. With the USD facing downward pressure due to expectations of a more accommodative Fed policy, gold's climb highlights a shift in trading dynamics. Investors will be closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators to gauge any changes in sentiment regarding future monetary policy.

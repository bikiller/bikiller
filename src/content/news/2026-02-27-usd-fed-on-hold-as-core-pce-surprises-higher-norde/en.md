US economic data has been sparse recently, but the December core PCE data, which showed an unexpected upside surprise, is putting pressure on expectations for inflation. The core PCE increased more than anticipated, signaling that price pressures are subsiding more slowly than what CPI data suggested. As a result, traders are now revising their outlook for the USD.

The Federal Reserve remains on hold, keeping interest rates steady for now. However, the unexpected PCE print leaves room for potential policy tightening if inflation persists. This has led to a slight strengthening of the USD across major currency pairs, with the EUR/USD seeing some downside momentum as the market adjusts. Traders will closely monitor upcoming data for further signs of inflationary pressures, which could influence the Fed’s next move.

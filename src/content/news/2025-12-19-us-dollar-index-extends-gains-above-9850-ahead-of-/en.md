The US Dollar Index (DXY) continues its upward trajectory, trading at approximately 98.60 during European hours on Friday. This marks the third consecutive session of gains for the index, which gauges the USD's strength against a basket of six major currencies. The index is benefiting from a supportive market environment as traders anticipate the upcoming University of Michigan (UoM) Survey data, which could further influence the USD's performance.

As the DXY rises, currency pairs such as EUR/USD may face increased pressure, reflecting the dollar's strength. The sustained gains above the key level of 98.50 suggest a bullish sentiment among investors, indicating potential volatility ahead of the UoM Survey release. Traders are closely monitoring this data for insights into consumer sentiment and inflation expectations, which could significantly impact exchange rates in the near term.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) is showing resilience in the Forex market, trading 0.1% higher against the US Dollar (USD) at approximately 1.3360 during Friday's European session. This modest gain comes amid market speculation surrounding a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, which has influenced traders' sentiments and currency movements.

As the exchange rate between GBP and USD fluctuates, the implications of these trading dynamics could affect broader market trends. Traders remain attentive to economic indicators and central bank communications that could further impact the GBP/USD currency pair, particularly as expectations grow regarding shifts in monetary policy from the Fed.

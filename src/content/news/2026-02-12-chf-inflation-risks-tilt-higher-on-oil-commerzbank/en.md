Swiss core inflation is expected to hold steady in January, with analysts forecasting no change, in line with Bloomberg's consensus. Commerzbank's Michael Pfister notes that the core inflation rate has been relatively stable in recent months, showing little movement. This stability suggests that inflationary pressures in Switzerland are not likely to shift dramatically in the short term.

However, Pfister also points out that inflation risks could increase due to rising oil prices, which have the potential to push up costs across various sectors. As oil prices fluctuate, the Swiss Franc (CHF) might experience additional volatility against major currencies such as the USD and EUR. Traders should monitor the Swiss inflation data closely as any deviation from expectations could impact the CHF exchange rate, influencing both domestic and global trading dynamics.

Silver prices have surged dramatically, with the XAG/USD currency pair reaching a record high of $93.50 after rebounding from a daily low of $86.91. This remarkable upward movement, reflecting an increase of over 7%, positions silver on the cusp of breaching the significant $100.00 threshold in the near future. 

Market analysts attribute this rally to heightened investor demand and geopolitical uncertainties, driving traders toward safe-haven assets like silver. As XAG/USD currently trades around $93.05, the momentum suggests continued bullish sentiment, indicating that the precious metal may maintain its upward trajectory against the USD as the market reacts to evolving economic conditions.

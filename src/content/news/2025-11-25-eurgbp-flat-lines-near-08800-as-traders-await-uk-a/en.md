The EUR/GBP currency pair is trading steadily around the exchange rate of 0.8790 during the early European session on Tuesday. Market participants are adopting a cautious stance ahead of the UK government's Autumn Budget announcement scheduled for Wednesday. This anticipation is influencing trading behavior, as investors weigh potential fiscal measures that could impact the British economy.

As traders await the budget details, the lack of significant movement in the EUR/GBP pair reflects broader uncertainties in the market. Any changes in fiscal policy or economic outlook could lead to heightened volatility in the exchange rate. With the current steady price action, all eyes remain focused on the upcoming budget announcement, which may set the tone for future trading sessions involving the euro and pound.

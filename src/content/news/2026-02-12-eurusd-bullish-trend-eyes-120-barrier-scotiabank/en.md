The EUR/USD currency pair is regaining strength following a brief pullback triggered by the latest Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report. Analysts from Scotiabank, including Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, highlight the Euro's stabilization as it continues to benefit from improving yield spreads between the Eurozone and the U.S. This shift suggests a return to fundamental drivers, with the exchange rate now eyeing the 1.20 resistance level.

As the EUR/USD moves upward, it reflects the growing positive correlation between European and U.S. assets, further supported by tightening yield differentials. Market sentiment remains optimistic, with traders anticipating that this upward momentum could push the exchange rate towards the key 1.20 barrier. With improving fundamentals and steady market conditions, the bullish outlook for the Euro remains intact in the near term.

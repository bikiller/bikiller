EUR/USD continues to demonstrate low volatility, remaining close to 5% as it trades within a defined range. According to ING's FX analyst Chris Turner, investors are currently favoring carry trades funded by the Euro (EUR), opting against the more unpredictable Japanese Yen (JPY). This strategic choice reflects a cautious approach to risk amid ongoing market conditions.

As the currency pair stabilizes, the exchange rate appears less susceptible to significant fluctuations. Traders seem to be positioning themselves ahead of upcoming economic indicators, which may further solidify the range-bound behavior of EUR/USD. With the current dynamics, market participants are likely to keep a close watch on potential catalysts that could disrupt this trend and influence the broader forex landscape.

The Indian Rupee (INR) is struggling against the US Dollar (USD) as the week begins, with the USD/INR currency pair holding steady near the monthly high of 90.70 reached on Friday. This strength in the USD is attributed to persistent selling by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in the Indian equity market, which has put downward pressure on the INR.

As trading continues, the exchange rate reflects broader market dynamics, with ongoing FIIs outflows reinforcing the USD's dominance. Investors will be closely monitoring this trend, as continued weakness in the INR could lead to heightened volatility in currency exchange rates, impacting trade and investment flows in the region.

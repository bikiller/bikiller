European Central Bank board member Isabel Schnabel expressed her comfort with investor expectations for a rate hike as the next move in monetary policy. This sentiment is likely to influence trading strategies in the forex market, particularly for the EUR/USD currency pair, which could see increased volatility as traders react to the potential for higher interest rates. 

As market participants adjust their positions, the euro may strengthen against the dollar, impacting the exchange rate dynamics. With the ECB's commitment to controlling inflation, a rate increase could provide further upward momentum for the euro, altering the trading landscape and prompting investors to reassess their strategies in response to changing monetary policy signals.

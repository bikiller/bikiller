Gold (XAU/USD) continues its downward trend, marking a fourth consecutive day of losses as it approaches a one-week low. On Tuesday, the precious metal has slipped below key support levels but has managed to hold above the psychological threshold of $4,000 during the Asian trading session. Market sentiment remains bearish as traders closely watch for a potential break beneath this critical level.

The ongoing decline in gold prices can be attributed to a stronger USD and shifting investor sentiment, prompting many to reevaluate their positions in the market. If gold fails to maintain the $4,000 mark, it could signal further weakness and pave the way for additional selling pressure. As traders monitor these fluctuations, the focus will be on how global economic conditions and currency exchange rates will impact the gold market in the coming days.

The United Kingdom's economic calendar is set to release crucial data this Thursday at 07:00 GMT, including the October Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Industrial Production figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). These figures are key indicators that could significantly influence the GBP/USD exchange rate, which is currently under pressure amid ongoing market volatility.

Traders will be closely watching the GDP print and industrial output, as stronger-than-expected results may bolster the British pound against the USD, potentially driving the GBP/USD higher. Conversely, disappointing data could trigger a sell-off, pushing the currency pair lower as investors reassess their positions ahead of the upcoming trading sessions. The market remains sensitive to economic signals, making this release critical for forecasting potential movement in the forex market.

The USD/INR currency pair continues its upward trajectory, climbing near the 90.00 level as the Indian Rupee (INR) struggles against the strengthening US Dollar (USD). This movement is largely driven by robust demand for USD from importers and ongoing foreign institutional investors (FIIs) withdrawing funds from the Indian stock market, causing the rupee to underperform against its global peers.

As FIIs pare their stakes, the Indian equity market faces increasing pressure, further exacerbating the INR's decline. The outflow of foreign funds indicates a cautious sentiment among investors regarding India's economic outlook, prompting a reevaluation of exposure to the local market. This trend raises concerns about the sustainability of the rupee's value, particularly as the USD remains in demand, influencing the broader exchange rate dynamics.

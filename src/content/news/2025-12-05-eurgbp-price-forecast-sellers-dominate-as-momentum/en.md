EUR/GBP remains under significant pressure as the Euro weakens against a resilient British Pound. Following the UK Autumn Budget, the exchange rate has seen the Sterling maintain its strength, reflecting market confidence. This trend comes amidst growing expectations for a Bank of England interest rate cut at the upcoming meeting on December 18, which has further influenced trading dynamics.

As sellers dominate the currency pair, momentum has shifted decidedly bearish, indicating a potential continuation of this downward trend. Traders are closely watching the market as the exchange rate reflects broader economic sentiments, particularly in relation to the anticipated policy changes from the BoE. The current market conditions suggest that the EUR/GBP could face additional volatility as both currencies navigate their respective economic landscapes.

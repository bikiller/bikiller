The US Dollar (USD) is showing strength against commodity currencies, though its gains are less noticeable in the broader market. Scotiabank reports that the DXY index remains range-bound, primarily due to the stability of the Euro (EUR), Swiss Franc (CHF), and Japanese Yen (JPY), which have largely maintained their positions throughout the trading session.

Despite the USD's overall firmness, the exchange rates for key currency pairs are steady. The EUR/USD remains relatively unchanged, while the USD/JPY and USD/CHF show minor fluctuations. This trading environment reflects a cautious sentiment among investors, as they await further economic indicators that could influence future currency movements.

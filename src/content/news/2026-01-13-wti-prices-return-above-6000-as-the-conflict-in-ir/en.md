WTI crude oil prices have surged over $4 per barrel in a four-day rally, peaking at nearly two-month highs of $60.50 on Tuesday. This upward movement comes amid escalating tensions in Iran, which has heightened concerns over potential supply disruptions. As prices retracted slightly to the $60.00 level, traders remain vigilant, monitoring geopolitical developments that could further impact market dynamics.

The strengthening of WTI is likely to influence the USD, as oil is a key driver of the American economy. The exchange rate fluctuations could also affect currency pairs like EUR/USD, as higher oil prices may drive inflation and adjust monetary policy expectations. Market participants are keenly aware of the implications for global trading patterns, particularly if the conflict escalates further and disrupts oil supply chains.

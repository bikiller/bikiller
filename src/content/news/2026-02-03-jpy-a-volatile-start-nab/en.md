The Japanese Yen (JPY) saw considerable volatility in January 2026, with the currency pair fluctuating between 153 and 159 against the US Dollar (USD). This marked a tumultuous start to the year, as market sentiment was driven by mixed economic data and shifting global risk appetite. Despite the turbulence, the Yen managed to end the month slightly stronger, closing near the lower end of its recent trading range.

The Yen's performance was influenced by various factors, including a strong USD driven by robust US economic indicators and Fed policy expectations. Meanwhile, the Euro (EUR) also played a role, as the EUR/JPY exchange rate saw swings due to diverging monetary policies between the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of Japan (BoJ). Traders remain cautious, eyeing any potential policy shifts that could further impact the Yen’s outlook in the coming months.

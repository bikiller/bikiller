EUR/USD is experiencing moderate losses as it approaches midday in Europe, with the exchange rate hovering near 1.1590. Earlier in Thursday's trading session, the currency pair saw a rejection above the 1.1600 level, which has contributed to the current downward movement. This dip comes amid a backdrop of thin trading conditions due to the Thanksgiving holiday.

The slight weakening of the euro against the USD reflects cautious market sentiment as traders navigate reduced liquidity. As the day progresses, participants will be keeping a close eye on potential developments that could influence the exchange rate, including economic data releases and geopolitical factors that may sway investor confidence.

EUR/JPY continues to climb, trading around 182.80 during the Asian session on Thursday, marking a second consecutive day of gains. The currency pair's upward momentum is driven by ongoing strength in the Euro, with the EUR/JPY exchange rate breaking above the key 182.50 level. The move reflects broader market dynamics, with traders anticipating further support for the Euro amid global risk appetite.

However, the Japanese Yen may limit the pair's upside potential. Expectations are building that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will maintain its tightening policy, which could strengthen the JPY. While EUR/JPY has risen, the prospect of higher Japanese interest rates is seen as a key factor that could restrain further gains. The currency pair's performance hinges on the BoJ's upcoming actions, with traders closely monitoring any shifts in monetary policy.

The USD/CAD currency pair is currently in a bearish consolidation phase, trading just below the key psychological level of 1.3800. During the Asian session on Thursday, the exchange rate hovered near its lowest point since October 22, reflecting market caution and potential vulnerabilities in the U.S. dollar.

The downward movement in USD/CAD signals a shift in trader sentiment, as the pair faces resistance below the 1.3800 mark. Economic indicators and geopolitical tensions may further influence trading activity, suggesting that the Canadian dollar could strengthen against its U.S. counterpart if current trends persist. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments as they assess potential entry points and market risks.

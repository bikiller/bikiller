EUR/USD continues to experience a bearish trend, opening the week at a four-week low of 1.1690 as market participants remain cautious. The currency pair has been under pressure, reflecting uncertainty ahead of significant U.S. macroeconomic data releases later in the week, including the ISM Manufacturing PMI figures. Traders are closely monitoring these indicators for potential impacts on the USD.

Additionally, geopolitical factors are also weighing on market sentiment, particularly the U.S. intervention in Venezuela. This development adds another layer of complexity to the trading landscape, influencing the exchange rate between the euro and the dollar. As the week progresses, traders will be looking for clearer signals from economic data to inform their positions on the EUR/USD pair.

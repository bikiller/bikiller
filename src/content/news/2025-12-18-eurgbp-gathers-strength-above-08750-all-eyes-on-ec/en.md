The EUR/GBP currency pair has gained momentum, trading near 0.8785 in the early European session on Thursday. This uptick follows a weaker performance by the Pound Sterling (GBP) prompted by UK inflation data that fell short of expectations. The disappointing figures have intensified speculation surrounding potential rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE), further pressuring the GBP against the Euro (EUR).

As the exchange rate pushes above 0.8750, market participants are closely monitoring upcoming decisions from both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the BoE. The outlook for monetary policy could significantly influence trading strategies, as investors recalibrate their positions in light of shifting interest rate expectations. The current trends suggest a growing bullish sentiment for the Euro, as economic indicators from the UK continue to weigh on the Pound.

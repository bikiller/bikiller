EUR/USD is trading under pressure on Wednesday as the pair slides amid mixed market sentiment. The exchange rate has been weighed down by a modest boost to the US Dollar (USD) following the release of second-tier US economic data. Despite limited impact on broader markets, the data helped reinforce expectations of a hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve.

Traders are now turning their attention to the upcoming FOMC Minutes, which are likely to provide further clarity on the central bank's policy outlook. The EUR/USD pair is hovering near key support levels, with the exchange rate showing resilience but facing challenges as the USD continues to gain traction. The currency pair is expected to remain volatile in the lead-up to the Minutes, with market participants eager for any signals that could influence future Federal Reserve actions.

The GBP/JPY currency pair is currently finding decent support near the 208.00 level, attracting some dip-buyers as traders look for opportunities. However, the pair has struggled to gain momentum, maintaining a negative bias throughout the early European session. This stagnation comes ahead of comments from Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, which could influence market sentiment.

Despite the modest buying interest around the 208.00 mark, the exchange rate remains below the year-to-date high, indicating potential resistance as traders await further economic signals. Market participants are closely monitoring developments related to UK monetary policy, particularly in light of the ongoing economic uncertainties and the impact of broader market trends involving major pairs like USD and EUR.

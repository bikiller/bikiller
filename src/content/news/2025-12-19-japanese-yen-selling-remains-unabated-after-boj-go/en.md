The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued to decline following comments from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda during the post-meeting press conference. The currency pair USD/JPY saw increased selling pressure, pushing the exchange rate to new intraday lows, as traders reacted to Ueda's remarks signaling a prolonged accommodative monetary policy.

This sustained weakness in the Yen has implications for other currency pairs as well, with the EUR/JPY also facing downward movement. Market participants are closely monitoring the BoJ's stance, as persistent Yen selling could influence broader trading strategies, particularly against the backdrop of rising interest rates in other economies. As the market digests these developments, the JPY's trajectory remains a key focus for forex traders.

EUR/JPY has surged to approximately 180.90, marking a 0.45% increase for the day and achieving a new multi-year high. This upward movement is primarily driven by a significant rise in Japanese government bond yields, which has intensified market pressure. Traders are closely monitoring these developments as they impact the exchange rate dynamics in the forex market.

Meanwhile, Eurozone inflation figures have shown signs of stabilization, providing support for the euro against the backdrop of rising Japanese yields. As the currency pair continues to trade near this technical level, market participants are adjusting their positions in response to shifting economic indicators, which could influence future movements in the USD/EUR and other currency pair valuations.

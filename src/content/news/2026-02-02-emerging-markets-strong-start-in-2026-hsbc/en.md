Emerging markets have surged at the start of 2026, with HSBC's report showing the MSCI EM index up nearly 11% in USD terms. This sharp rise contrasts with the MSCI US index’s modest 2% gain, highlighting a strong shift in market sentiment. The robust performance of EM currencies is driving stronger exchange rate movements, providing traders with a favorable environment for trading emerging market pairs.

This uptick in EM assets has been fueled by a combination of factors, including favorable global growth projections and a weakening USD. The positive market sentiment has bolstered the value of emerging market currencies against major counterparts like the EUR and USD. As the year progresses, traders will likely continue to focus on these currency pairs, with the USD showing signs of further softness, potentially offering more upside for EM currencies.

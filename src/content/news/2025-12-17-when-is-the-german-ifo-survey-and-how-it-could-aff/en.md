On Wednesday at 09:00 GMT, Germany's IFO Institute will release its crucial business survey for December, which is anticipated to influence the EUR/USD currency pair. Traders will be closely monitoring the survey results, as a stronger-than-expected reading could boost the euro, impacting the exchange rate against the USD. Conversely, disappointing figures may pressure the euro lower, potentially testing key support levels.

Market participants are particularly focused on the IFO survey's implications for the European Central Bank's monetary policy outlook. Any signs of improvement in business sentiment could reinforce expectations of sustained economic recovery in the Eurozone, prompting bullish sentiment for EUR/USD trading. As the exchange rate hovers around critical technical levels, volatility is expected in the lead-up to and following the announcement.

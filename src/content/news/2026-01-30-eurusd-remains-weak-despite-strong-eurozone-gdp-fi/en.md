The Euro (EUR) continues to show weakness against the US Dollar (USD) as the EUR/USD currency pair trades at 1.1915. This decline comes despite the release of robust Eurozone GDP figures, which typically bolster the currency. Traders are now closely monitoring the support level around 1.1900, as a breach below this could signal further bearish momentum.

Market sentiment appears cautious, overshadowing positive economic data, which raises questions about the Eurozone’s recovery trajectory. The exchange rate dynamics reflect a stronger USD in the current environment, potentially influenced by broader market trends and investor preferences. As the trading week progresses, participants will be keenly watching for any developments that could impact the EUR/USD pair's outlook.

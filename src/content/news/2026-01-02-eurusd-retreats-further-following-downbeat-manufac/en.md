EUR/USD is experiencing a notable retreat, now trading around the 1.1730 mark during Friday's European session. This decline follows disappointing manufacturing data that has weighed heavily on market sentiment. The currency pair had previously peaked above the 1.1800 level in late December, but the recent data has prompted investors to reassess their positions.

The exchange rate movement reflects increasing pressures on the euro as economic indicators strain confidence in the currency. As traders digest the implications of the latest manufacturing figures, the downward trend in EUR/USD highlights the ongoing volatility in the forex market, driven by economic fundamentals and shifts in investor sentiment towards both the euro and the US dollar.

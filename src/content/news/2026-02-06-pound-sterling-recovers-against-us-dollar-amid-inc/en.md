The Pound Sterling (GBP) made a notable recovery against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, bouncing back after a sharp decline the previous day. This rebound followed heightened market speculation that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more dovish stance, signaling reduced chances of aggressive rate hikes. As a result, the GBP/USD exchange rate improved, climbing from a low of 1.2260 to 1.2350, reflecting the shifting market sentiment.

The initial drop in GBP came amid signals from the Bank of England (BoE) suggesting a potential interest rate cut in the near term. This dovish outlook pressured the Pound as traders adjusted their positions. However, the reversal was driven by increasing bets on a more cautious Fed, fueling demand for riskier assets like the GBP. The EUR/GBP pair also saw slight volatility, testing 0.8750 before stabilizing.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, marking its second consecutive day in positive territory. The AUD/USD currency pair rose by 0.25%, trading at 0.6700, supported by stronger-than-expected domestic economic data. The upbeat figures fueled market expectations of further tightening by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), with rate hike bets now gaining traction.

As the Australian economy shows resilience, traders are reassessing the outlook for RBA policy. With inflationary pressures remaining persistent, the AUD’s upward momentum against the USD could continue, particularly if economic reports continue to surprise to the upside. However, concerns over global growth and the USD's performance amid Federal Reserve decisions will likely remain key factors for this currency pair's near-term direction.

EUR/USD extended its losses on Wednesday, falling over 0.60% to trade below the key 1.2000 level. The decline came after the Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates, with Chair Jerome Powell maintaining a neutral stance on monetary policy. Powell also avoided engaging in political discussions, leaving market participants uncertain about future Fed actions.

The Euro struggled as the U.S. Dollar strengthened, supported by the Fed's decision to hold rates steady. The EUR/USD exchange rate hovered below 1.2000, a critical technical level, reflecting investor caution. As Powell's comments provided little direction, traders remain focused on upcoming economic data for clearer signals on the Fed's next moves.

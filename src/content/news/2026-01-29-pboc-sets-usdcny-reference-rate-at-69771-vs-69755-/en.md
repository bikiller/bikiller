The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the USD/CNY reference rate at 6.9771 for Thursday’s trading session, slightly higher than the previous day’s fix of 6.9755. This marks a subtle adjustment of the Chinese yuan's exchange rate against the US dollar. The PBOC's move follows market expectations, which had pegged the central rate at 6.9521 according to a Reuters estimate.

This marginal increase in the USD/CNY reference rate could signal the PBOC’s cautious approach to managing the yuan's stability amidst global economic pressures. Traders will closely monitor further adjustments in the central parity to gauge any potential interventions or policy shifts aimed at controlling yuan volatility in the international forex market.

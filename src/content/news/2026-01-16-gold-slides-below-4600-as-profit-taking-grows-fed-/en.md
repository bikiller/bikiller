Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a significant decline on Friday, slipping below the $4,600 mark with losses exceeding 0.70%. The drop comes as traders engage in profit-taking following a robust two-week trend. Recent U.S. labor market data revealed resilience, challenging earlier expectations of weakness, which has influenced market sentiment and prompted adjustments in trading strategies.

As doubts about potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts rise, the shift in the gold market reflects broader implications for the USD exchange rate. Investors are recalibrating their positions, resulting in increased volatility not only for gold but also across various currency pairs. The current market dynamics underscore the interplay between economic indicators and precious metal trading, highlighting the importance of ongoing data releases in shaping investor outlooks.

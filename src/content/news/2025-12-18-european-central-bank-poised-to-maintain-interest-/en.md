The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to maintain its interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive meeting, as it convenes for its final two-day policy session of the year. Investors are closely watching the ECB's upcoming announcement on Thursday, which is expected to influence the EUR/USD exchange rate. The Euro has shown resilience against the USD, holding above critical technical levels, reflecting market anticipation for a steady monetary policy.

This decision to keep rates steady could have significant implications for traders in the forex market. A stable eurozone interest rate environment may sustain the current EUR/USD trading range, affecting market sentiment and positioning. As the central bank navigates economic challenges, the focus remains on inflation and growth, setting the stage for potential shifts in monetary policy in the new year.

EUR/JPY continues its downward correction for the third consecutive day, trading around 182.70 at the time of writing, down 0.50% on the day. The yen has gained strength following the victory of Taro Aso in the leadership race, which has sparked speculation about potential monetary intervention by the Bank of Japan. This has led to a shift in sentiment, pushing the currency pair lower.

The weakening of the euro against the yen has resulted in a notable pullback, with traders closely monitoring Japan’s policy stance for any hints of intervention. Market participants are keen to see how the Japanese government responds to the yen's recent appreciation, which could have further implications for the EUR/JPY exchange rate in the coming days.

The Euro (EUR) held steady in the mid-1.17 range as it entered Monday's North American session, showing a slight gain against the US Dollar (USD). Trading within a tight range, the EUR/USD currency pair reflects cautious market sentiment ahead of the European Central Bank's (ECB) meeting later this week. Investors are attentively watching for any signals that could impact future monetary policy.

As the exchange rate stabilizes, traders are keenly aware of the implications that the ECB's decisions may have on the Euro's performance. With the EUR/USD currently hovering around the mid-1.17s, market participants are bracing for potential volatility depending on the central bank's stance on economic recovery and inflation, which could shape the currency pair's path in the near term.

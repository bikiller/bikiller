Gold prices (XAU/USD) dipped below the $4,600 mark on Tuesday, following the release of December's US Consumer Price Index (CPI), which indicated stable inflation levels. This data suggests that the Federal Reserve may be considering further rate cuts, impacting the overall trading environment for precious metals.

As the US dollar remains resilient, the exchange rate adjustments have capped gold's gains. Investors are closely monitoring the implications of the CPI report, as a stable inflation outlook could lead to a shift in the USD’s strength against other currencies, including the EUR. Market participants are recalibrating their positions in light of the potential for changing monetary policy.

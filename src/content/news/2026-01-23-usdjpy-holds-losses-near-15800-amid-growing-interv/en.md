The USD/JPY currency pair remains under pressure, trading just above the 158.00 mark after retreating from earlier highs around 159.20. The movement comes amid rising speculation of possible intervention from Japanese authorities, aiming to curb the Yen's continued weakening. As the exchange rate hovers near this key level, traders are closely monitoring any official response from Japan’s government.

The US Dollar has been resilient against the Japanese Yen, but the growing intervention rumors are keeping the market on edge. A sharp pullback from the 159.20 peak signals that the market remains cautious, aware of potential actions that could impact the USD/JPY trading dynamics. The next few sessions will likely determine whether the Yen's weakness persists or if intervention efforts materialize.

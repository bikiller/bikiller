Banxico's Deputy Governor Galia Borja recently indicated that the central bank has room to cut interest rates further, driven by weak domestic demand, declining investment, and the resilience of the Peso. This dovish stance could influence the Mexican Peso (MXN) against major currencies like the USD and EUR. The market is pricing in a potential shift in policy, which might impact the MXN's exchange rate in the near term.

The Mexican Peso has remained resilient despite these signals, with the USD/MXN pair holding steady around key support levels. The stronger Peso, coupled with the central bank’s cautious outlook on the economy, suggests a delicate balance between easing policy and maintaining financial stability. Traders will be closely watching Banxico's next moves to gauge the future direction of the currency pair and broader market sentiment.

Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a dramatic collapse on Friday, plunging over 30% as part of a broader rout in the precious metals market. The grey metal fell more than $38, dropping from a daily high of $118.46 to trade at $76.91. This sharp decline signals a severe selloff, driven by broader financial market volatility and investor flight from risk assets.

The rapid movement in XAG/USD highlights the heightened market instability, as traders reacted to broader market pressures. With silver trading at such levels, the impact ripples across the forex market, potentially affecting exchange rates and commodity-linked currencies. The fall underscores the sensitivity of metals to market sentiment, further complicating the outlook for the precious metals sector.

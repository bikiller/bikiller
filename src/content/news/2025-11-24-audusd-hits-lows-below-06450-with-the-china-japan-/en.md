The Australian Dollar (AUD) is facing downward pressure, with the AUD/USD currency pair falling to lows below 0.6450 as tensions between China and Japan dampen market sentiment. Despite a generally positive market outlook on Monday, the Aussie has struggled to gain traction against the US Dollar (USD), reflecting broader regional uncertainties.

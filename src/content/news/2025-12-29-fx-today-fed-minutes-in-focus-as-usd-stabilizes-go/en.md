The focus for traders this week is squarely on the release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes. During this meeting, the Fed reduced its benchmark rate by 25 basis points and hinted at a potential further cut in 2026. As a result, the US dollar has stabilized, with key currency pairs like EUR/USD currently trading around 1.09, reflecting cautious optimism following the anticipated news.

In contrast, gold prices have slipped as investors weigh the implications of the Fed's stance. The yellow metal is experiencing downward pressure, with prices hovering near $1,850 per ounce. Market participants are closely monitoring exchange rates and volatility as they await further insight into the Fed's monetary policy direction, which could significantly impact trading strategies in the coming weeks.

The USD/CAD currency pair continues its upward momentum, trading above the 1.3850 level for the fifth consecutive day. As of Thursday's Asian trading session, the exchange rate hovers around 1.3860, reflecting ongoing concerns regarding Canadian oil demand. These apprehensions are likely weighing on the Canadian dollar, prompting traders to favor the USD.

The persistent strength of the U.S. dollar amid fluctuating oil prices has bolstered the exchange rate, as investors reassess the outlook for Canadian energy exports. With key technical levels now breached, market participants will be closely monitoring any developments that could influence the future direction of the USD/CAD pair, particularly any signs of recovery in global oil demand or shifts in U.S. economic data.

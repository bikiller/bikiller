The USD/KRW exchange rate could face upward pressure following recent developments in South Korea's economy. In December, industrial production showed a significant rebound, signaling strong export growth. This positive economic performance has raised expectations for a potential supplementary budget, as President Lee has hinted at additional fiscal measures to support key sectors. These factors suggest upside risks to the nation's growth prospects, potentially impacting the Korean won.

As a result, market traders are closely monitoring the USD/KRW currency pair for further signs of volatility. The possible budget stimulus could boost investor sentiment, which may lead to increased demand for the won. Should the supplementary budget be confirmed, the exchange rate may experience fluctuations, pushing USD/KRW higher. Forex traders should remain cautious, as the outlook for Korea’s economic recovery and fiscal policy could influence short-term market movements.

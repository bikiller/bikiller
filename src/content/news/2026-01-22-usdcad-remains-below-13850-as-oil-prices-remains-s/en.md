The USD/CAD currency pair continues to struggle in negative territory, trading around 1.3830 during the Asian hours on Thursday. This marks the fourth consecutive session below the key level of 1.3850, as the Canadian dollar finds support from stronger oil prices, which have bolstered the loonie against its U.S. counterpart.

The persistent weakness in USD/CAD reflects broader market dynamics, where fluctuating oil prices play a crucial role in shaping the exchange rate. As traders closely monitor energy markets, any further strength in oil could continue to pressure the USD, affecting overall trading strategies. With the ongoing softness in the dollar, market participants will be keen to assess potential implications for the currency pair in the coming sessions.

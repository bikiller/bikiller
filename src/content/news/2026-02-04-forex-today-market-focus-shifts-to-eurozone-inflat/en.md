The forex market shifts focus on Thursday, February 4, as attention turns to Eurozone inflation and critical US data. The EUR/USD pair hovers around 1.2150, marking a slight pullback from its recent high of 1.2200. Traders are positioning for the Eurozone's January inflation report, with expectations for a rise to 0.9% year-over-year, potentially influencing the European Central Bank's future decisions.

Meanwhile, the US dollar remains under pressure as markets await key economic data, including the January nonfarm payrolls report and the ISM Services PMI. The USD/JPY is trading just above 114.00, a critical level for traders watching for any signs of economic recovery. Any surprise shifts in these data points could trigger significant volatility across major currency pairs.

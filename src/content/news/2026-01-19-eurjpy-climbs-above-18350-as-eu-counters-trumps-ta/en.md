The EUR/JPY currency pair surged above 183.50 after a three-day streak of losses, showing a notable recovery as it traded around 183.60 during the Asian session on Monday. This bounce back comes as the European Union takes a firm stance against tariff threats from former President Trump, potentially bolstering investor confidence in the euro.

The exchange rate action reflects broader market sentiment, with traders reacting to geopolitical developments that could influence trade dynamics. As the EUR strengthens against the JPY, market participants are keeping a close eye on further economic indicators and political maneuvers that could impact the euro’s trajectory in the coming sessions.

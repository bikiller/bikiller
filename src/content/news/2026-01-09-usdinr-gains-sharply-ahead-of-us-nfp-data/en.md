The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a notable decline against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR exchange rate surging to approximately 90.47. This sharp movement reflects the USD's ongoing strength in the market as traders position themselves ahead of the crucial Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data set to be released at 13:30 GMT. 

As anticipation builds around the NFP figures for December, market participants are closely monitoring the implications for monetary policy and economic health. The robust performance of the USD may signal increased volatility in the currency pair, creating both opportunities and risks for traders navigating the foreign exchange landscape.

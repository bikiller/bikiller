Gold (XAU/USD) has recently experienced a pullback after hitting a record high of $4,967, trading at $4,915 as of the latest update. The yellow metal surged for four consecutive days, driven by ongoing market uncertainties and a weakening USD. However, the pullback suggests some profit-taking or consolidation at these elevated levels. 

The currency pair’s movement reflects broader market dynamics, with investors closely monitoring fluctuations in the USD. As gold approaches critical technical levels near $5,000, traders are evaluating whether the rally will resume or face further corrections. The direction of XAU/USD remains closely tied to US economic data and global risk sentiment, potentially influencing the exchange rate in the near term.

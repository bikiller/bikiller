Gold (XAU/USD) has continued to retreat from its recent high of $4,500, marking a more than one-week peak reached earlier this Wednesday. The price decline is primarily attributed to profit-taking ahead of critical U.S. economic data, signaling a shift in market sentiment as traders reassess their positions.

The downward movement has reversed a significant portion of the previous day's gains, reflecting cautious trading in the face of upcoming announcements that could impact the USD exchange rate. As investors navigate fluctuations in the currency pair, the gold market remains sensitive to broader economic indicators, leaving room for further volatility in the days to come.

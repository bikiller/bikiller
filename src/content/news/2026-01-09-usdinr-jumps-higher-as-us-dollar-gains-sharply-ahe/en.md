The Indian Rupee (INR) fell sharply against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, with the USD/INR currency pair climbing to approximately 90.47. This movement comes as the US Dollar demonstrates significant strength ahead of the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) data for December, set for release at 13:30 GMT. Market participants are closely monitoring this economic indicator for insights into the health of the US labor market.

The surge in the USD has led to increased volatility in the forex market as traders position themselves ahead of the NFP announcement. A robust NFP report could bolster the USD further, potentially impacting trading strategies across various currency pairs. As the exchange rate of USD/INR continues to rise, analysts suggest that the Rupee's weakening could reflect broader challenges in the Indian economy, emphasizing the importance of upcoming economic data for market direction.

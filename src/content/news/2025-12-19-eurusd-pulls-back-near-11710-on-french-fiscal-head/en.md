The EUR/USD currency pair experienced a decline, trading around 1.1710 as French Prime Minister Lecornu announced that the Parliament would not meet the year-end budget approval deadline. This unexpected development has necessitated a special rollover law, further complicating the fiscal landscape in France and impacting market sentiment.

As trading continues, the exchange rate reflects concerns over potential instability stemming from the delayed budget process. The move could influence investor confidence in the euro, adding pressure against the dollar as traders assess the broader implications for the eurozone economy and its relationship with the USD. Market participants will be closely monitoring how these fiscal headwinds might affect future trading dynamics for the EUR/USD pair.

Dow Jones futures slid 0.03%, reaching approximately 49,550 during European trading on Tuesday, reflecting growing risk aversion. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also fell by 0.16% and 0.48%, respectively, hovering around 6,850 and 24,700. Investors are increasingly cautious amid rising concerns surrounding AI developments, which are weighing on market sentiment and contributing to a weaker outlook for riskier assets.

The decline in U.S. futures is impacting currency markets, as traders shift focus to safer assets. The USD remains under pressure, with the EUR/USD exchange rate seeing minor fluctuations. Risk-off sentiment is leading to a preference for traditional safe havens, including the yen and Swiss franc. The market's focus is likely to remain on these concerns, with further movements in major indices and currencies expected in the near term.

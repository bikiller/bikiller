West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have bounced back from a one-week low of $58.70, observed during the Asian trading session. Currently, WTI is trading around the $59.20 mark, reflecting a modest decline of 0.15% for the day. The recovery comes as the commodity attempts to fill part of the bearish gap created at the start of the week, though bullish momentum remains elusive.

Mixed market cues continue to influence WTI’s performance, with traders keeping a close eye on geopolitical developments and changes in demand forecasts. The $58.70 level has proven to be a crucial support point, and a sustained recovery above $59.00 could signal a shift in sentiment. However, the lack of strong conviction in the current trading environment suggests that the oil market may remain volatile in the coming sessions.

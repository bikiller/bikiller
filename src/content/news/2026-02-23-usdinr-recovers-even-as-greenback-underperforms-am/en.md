The Indian Rupee (INR) reversed early gains and weakened against the US Dollar (USD) during afternoon trading on Monday. The USD/INR pair edged up towards the 91.00 level, despite the broader weakness of the USD. The Greenback continues to face pressure amidst ongoing uncertainty surrounding US trade policies, which has weighed on investor sentiment and dampened demand for the dollar.

Despite the US Dollar underperforming, the INR struggled to maintain its earlier momentum. The currency pair’s movement near the 91.00 technical level highlights ongoing volatility in the market, with traders eyeing potential shifts in US trade policies. The exchange rate remains susceptible to fluctuations, with global risk sentiment and US economic signals likely to impact the INR's performance in the coming sessions.

The EUR/USD currency pair experienced a significant decline on Wednesday, dropping over 0.49% to trade at 1.1524. This downturn followed the release of the Federal Reserve's minutes from the October meeting, which suggested that the central bank may forgo an interest rate cut in December. The exchange rate fell as low as 1.1600 earlier in the session, reflecting traders’ reactions to the Fed's more hawkish stance.

As the market digests the implications of the Fed's commentary, sentiment around the USD remains robust. The potential delay of a rate cut has heightened expectations for continued dollar strength, complicating the outlook for the euro. Traders will closely monitor any further developments or statements from Fed officials that could further influence the dynamics of the EUR/USD pair in the coming days.

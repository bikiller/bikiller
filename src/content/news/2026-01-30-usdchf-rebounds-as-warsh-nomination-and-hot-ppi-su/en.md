I’m missing the actual market data needed to do this properly. The excerpt you shared doesn’t include **prices, percentages, or technical levels**, and I can’t invent those.

Please paste the **full original forex news article** (or at least the parts with the USD/CHF exchange rate, moves, and any support/resistance levels), and I’ll rewrite it cleanly into a tight 150–200 word professional piece that hits all your requirements.

The Eurozone PMI data suggests signs of a cautious recovery in key economies like France and Germany. TD Securities expects a rebound in France's Services sector, which experienced an overdone decline in January. This recovery could support the EUR/USD exchange rate, potentially driving the euro higher in the coming sessions. Traders will monitor how these developments impact the broader market sentiment and EUR's performance against the USD.

Meanwhile, German Manufacturing PMI is forecasted to edge slightly higher, bolstered by increased defense procurement. This uptick in manufacturing activity may help stabilize the euro as a currency, providing further support to EUR/USD trading dynamics. As market participants adjust to these factors, the euro could see modest gains in the near term, with EUR/USD potentially testing new technical levels.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) remained steady against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, following the release of Australia’s December Trade Balance data. The country’s trade surplus widened to AUD 3,373M, up from a revised AUD 2,597M in November. This result slightly exceeded market expectations, providing modest support to the AUD as investors digested the figures.

Despite the positive data, the AUD/USD exchange rate showed limited movement, maintaining its position within recent ranges. The stronger-than-expected surplus did not trigger a significant shift, as market participants await further economic signals. Traders are now focused on upcoming developments in both domestic and global markets, particularly in relation to interest rate outlooks and global trade trends.

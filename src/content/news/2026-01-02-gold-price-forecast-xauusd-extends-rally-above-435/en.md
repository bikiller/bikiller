Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to nearly $4,375 during early European trading on Friday, continuing their upward trajectory. This rally is primarily driven by increasing expectations of interest rate cuts from the US Federal Reserve, which has bolstered demand for the safe-haven asset. As traders react to these developments, the exchange rate reflects the shifting dynamics in the market.

The prevailing geopolitical tensions further enhance gold's appeal, as investors seek refuge amidst uncertainty. With the US dollar under pressure, the bullish sentiment surrounding gold may persist, potentially leading to significant trading opportunities in the coming sessions. Market participants will be closely monitoring Fed announcements and broader economic indicators that could influence the currency pair's movement.

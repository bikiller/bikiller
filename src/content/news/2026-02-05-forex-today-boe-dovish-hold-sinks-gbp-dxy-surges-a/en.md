The GBP/USD plunged following the Bank of England's dovish stance, with the currency pair sliding to 1.2030, down nearly 0.8%. The BoE’s decision to hold rates prompted market concerns about the UK economy’s slowing recovery, weakening the British pound. The USD benefitted, and the DXY surged, rising 0.6% to 103.55, boosted by higher Treasury yields and hawkish sentiment around the Federal Reserve's policies.

Meanwhile, gold prices saw a notable dip, falling below $1,920 an ounce, down 1.2%, as the stronger USD and rising yields put downward pressure on the precious metal. The EUR/USD traded at 1.0600, weakening by 0.5%, as European Central Bank signals remained cautious, leading to muted expectations for aggressive rate hikes. The combination of global central bank policies continues to drive volatility, with the USD firmly in the driver’s seat for now.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) held steady against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, maintaining a flat exchange rate following two consecutive days of gains. Traders are exercising caution as they await the release of the November Consumer Price Index (CPI), set to be announced on Wednesday. This anticipated data is likely to influence market sentiment and trading strategies in the coming sessions.

As the AUD/USD currency pair remains in a narrow range, market participants are closely monitoring technical levels and potential volatility stemming from the CPI report. A strong CPI outcome could bolster the AUD, while a weaker reading might lead to a shift in market dynamics, particularly affecting the AUD's performance against major currencies like the EUR. The market waits with bated breath for insights that could shape the trading landscape.

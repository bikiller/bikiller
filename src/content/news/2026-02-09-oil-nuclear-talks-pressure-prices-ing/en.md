Constructive US-Iran nuclear talks are putting downward pressure on oil prices, as market sentiment fluctuates between optimism and caution. ING analysts highlight that these discussions have eased some geopolitical tensions, reducing the perceived risk premium in Brent crude. Despite this, volatility remains elevated, with speculative net longs on ICE Brent rising, reflecting market uncertainty. 

The trading environment remains fragile, particularly for currency pairs like USD/EUR, where oil price movements play a significant role. While the Brent price is still influenced by broader geopolitical developments, the increasing bullish volatility skew suggests traders are positioning for potential price swings. This dynamic keeps traders on edge, with oil continuing to be a key driver in broader forex market fluctuations.

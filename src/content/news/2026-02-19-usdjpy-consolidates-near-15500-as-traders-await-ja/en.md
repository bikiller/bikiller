The USD/JPY currency pair is holding steady near the 155.00 level as traders await the release of Japan's inflation data on Friday. Despite the US Dollar (USD) maintaining strength across the board, the Japanese Yen (JPY) has been consolidating in a narrow range, with the exchange rate failing to build on its recent momentum. Investors are taking a cautious approach ahead of the key economic release.

Market participants are focused on Japan's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which could provide fresh insights into inflation trends and influence the Bank of Japan's future monetary policy.

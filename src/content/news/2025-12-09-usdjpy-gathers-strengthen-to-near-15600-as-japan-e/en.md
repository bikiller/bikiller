The USD/JPY currency pair is seeing increased buying interest, currently trading near 155.95 in the early Asian session on Tuesday. This uptick comes as the Japanese Yen (JPY) weakens against the US Dollar (USD), primarily due to concerns surrounding the impact of a significant earthquake in Japan. Traders are closely monitoring the situation, which adds volatility to the exchange rate.

As the earthquake's implications unfold, the market remains cautious, potentially influencing broader market sentiment. The current level of 155.95 marks a critical technical threshold for the USD/JPY pair, suggesting that further movements could hinge on both domestic developments in Japan and global risk appetite. With the USD gaining traction, traders will continue to assess the evolving situation for future trading opportunities.

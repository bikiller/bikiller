The AUD/USD currency pair is consolidating below the mid-0.6600s, maintaining its recent strong gains that reached the highest level since September 18. Throughout the Asian session on Wednesday, the pair has experienced minor fluctuations, oscillating between slight gains and losses as traders remain cautious.

Market participants are closely watching the upcoming Federal Reserve decision, which could significantly impact the exchange rate. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s hawkish stance is contributing to the bullish sentiment for the Aussie dollar, suggesting potential upward momentum for AUD/USD if the Fed signals a more dovish approach. As traders navigate these influences, the currency pair's performance will remain closely tied to developments in U.S. monetary policy.

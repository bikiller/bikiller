The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthened against most major currencies on Thursday, with the exception of the antipodean currencies. The British currency rose after the UK’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) exceeded expectations, showing a 0.4% increase in December. This unexpected inflation data fueled investor optimism for the UK economy, bolstering the GBP’s demand across the forex market.

GBP/USD climbed to a high of 1.2435 during the European session, reflecting strong bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the GBP/EUR pair also saw notable gains, breaking through key resistance levels at 1.1440. Traders now await the release of UK retail sales and flash PMI data, which could further influence the GBP's trajectory. These upcoming reports will provide additional insights into the UK’s economic recovery, potentially guiding future market decisions.

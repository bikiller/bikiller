EUR/USD has been trading within a range as markets react to comments from ECB President Christine Lagarde. According to a Financial Times report, there is speculation that Lagarde could leave her post before her term expires in October 2027. This has sparked concerns over potential changes at the ECB, with focus shifting to possible successors, including Pablo Hernandez de Cos and Joachim Nagel. The speculation is further fueled by the political dynamics in France, where the presidential elections could influence the ECB's leadership.

The currency pair saw limited movement, with EUR/USD hovering around its recent levels. As the market digests this uncertainty, traders are paying close attention to the implications for the ECB’s future policy direction. A change in leadership could impact the EUR’s value, particularly if the shift leads to a more hawkish or dovish stance. For now, the exchange rate remains within established ranges, awaiting clearer signals from the central bank and the political landscape.

The GBP/JPY currency pair faces difficulty maintaining momentum, trading near the lower end of its daily range just below the 211.00 level. Despite a modest uptick during the Asian session on Thursday, the exchange rate shows signs of weakness as the market gravitates towards safe-haven assets, particularly the Japanese yen.

The lack of bearish conviction in GBP/JPY suggests traders remain cautious amid broader market uncertainties. As the yen benefits from its safe-haven status, the ongoing struggle of the pair highlights the challenges it faces in gaining traction, prompting traders to closely monitor developments that could impact the exchange rate in the coming sessions.

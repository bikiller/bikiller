The US Dollar (USD) faced downward pressure on Wednesday, despite encouraging economic data emerging from the United States ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Traders are increasingly anticipating another rate cut from the Federal Reserve in December, which has contributed to the USD's struggle against major currencies, particularly the euro.

As focus shifts to the eurozone, the EUR/USD exchange rate is poised to gain traction. Market sentiment indicates that the European currency may strengthen further as investors digest upcoming euro-related data. The implications of these movements could lead to increased volatility in currency pair trading, influencing decisions as traders position themselves for potential shifts in monetary policy from both central banks.

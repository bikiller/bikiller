The NZD/USD currency pair has softened, trading around 0.5765 during the early hours of Thursday in Asia. This decline comes as renewed demand for the US dollar (USD) drives the exchange rate lower. Traders are closely monitoring the market as the USD gains strength amid expectations of an upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cut.

Despite this downward movement, analysts suggest that further losses for the NZD/USD may be capped. The anticipation of a rate cut next week could limit the pair's decline, as traders weigh the implications of potential monetary policy changes on the broader market. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate are likely to continue, influenced by both USD demand and prevailing interest rate sentiments.

USD/CHF remains under pressure near 0.7750, slipping to around 0.7730 during Friday’s Asian trading session after posting only modest gains a day earlier. The currency pair is struggling to sustain upside momentum as the Swiss Franc strengthens on renewed safe-haven demand. Heightened trade frictions and persistent geopolitical tensions have prompted investors to trim USD exposure, weighing on the exchange rate.

The softer tone in the USD comes as market participants turn cautious ahead of upcoming Swiss GDP data, which could offer fresh direction for the franc. In the broader forex landscape, risk-sensitive assets are facing headwinds, while defensive currencies outperform. The CHF’s resilience contrasts with more mixed performance across major pairs such as EUR/USD, highlighting shifting capital flows in global trading.

From a technical perspective, holding below the 0.7750 zone keeps short-term downside risks in focus for USD/CHF. A sustained move around 0.7730 suggests sellers remain active, with traders monitoring incoming economic releases for confirmation of momentum. Any surprise in Swiss growth figures could trigger volatility, influencing near-term positioning in the USD and broader currency market sentiment.

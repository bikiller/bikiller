Gold (XAU/USD) is trading within a narrow range on Thursday, currently priced around $4,0873, as market participants analyze a mixed release of September's delayed U.S. jobs data. Despite stronger-than-expected non-farm payroll figures, the precious metal has shown limited movement, reflecting ongoing uncertainty in the market.

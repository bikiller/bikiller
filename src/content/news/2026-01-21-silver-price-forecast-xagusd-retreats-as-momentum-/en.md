Silver prices (XAG/USD) softened on Wednesday, retreating from a daily peak of $95.56 as bullish momentum waned. The decline came in the wake of US President Donald Trump’s remarks at the Davos summit, where he adopted a more conciliatory tone regarding negotiations with Denmark over Greenland, shifting market sentiment.

The easing of tensions, coupled with a stronger USD, influenced traders' decisions, leading to a pullback in the silver market. As the exchange rate fluctuates, investors are closely monitoring geopolitical developments and their potential impact on commodity prices. With the technical levels under scrutiny, market participants are keen to see if silver can regain its upward momentum or if further corrections are on the horizon.

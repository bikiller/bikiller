The Pound Sterling (GBP) showed resilience in Friday's European trading session, climbing against major currencies despite a disappointing retail sales report. Data revealed that UK Retail Sales fell unexpectedly by 0.6% in November, raising concerns over consumer spending. Nevertheless, GBP/USD strengthened to an exchange rate of 1.3150, while GBP/EUR rose to 1.1450, reflecting positive market sentiment towards the currency.

Analysts suggest that the Pound's performance may be attributed to broader market dynamics and investor confidence in the UK's economic recovery. The fluctuations in the exchange rates indicate ongoing volatility, driven by external factors such as inflation and monetary policy expectations. Traders are keenly observing these developments as they navigate the challenges presented by weaker retail data while positioning themselves for potential gains in the currency pair market.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a notable decline, tumbling to around $93.60 during Asian trading hours on Tuesday. This drop comes as profit-taking follows the metal's surge to a record high in the previous session, reflecting a natural pullback in the market. The strong upward momentum in recent trading had attracted significant interest, but traders are now cashing in on gains.

Despite the current downturn, the safe-haven appeal of silver may provide a cushion against further losses in the near term. As global economic uncertainties continue to influence investor behavior, demand for silver as a protective asset could stabilize the exchange rate. Market participants will be closely monitoring any developments that could impact trading dynamics in the XAG/USD currency pair as they navigate this volatile landscape.

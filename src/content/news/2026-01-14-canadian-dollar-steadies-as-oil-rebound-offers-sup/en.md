The Canadian Dollar (CAD) has shown resilience against the US Dollar (USD), gaining slightly as it finds stability in a narrow trading range after its decline since late December. As of now, the CAD trades in a tight consolidation pattern, reflecting a cautious market sentiment. 

A key factor contributing to this steadiness is the rebound in oil prices, which provides essential support for the CAD. Given Canada's status as a major oil exporter, the recovery in crude prices directly influences the CAD's exchange rate dynamics, impacting its performance against other currencies, including the Euro (EUR). As traders closely monitor these developments, the CAD's ability to maintain its footing may hinge on further movements in the oil market.

Silver (XAG/USD) surged to an unprecedented high of $94.15 on Monday, driven by strong safe-haven demand amid rising trade and geopolitical tensions. The threat of tariffs announced by former President Trump has intensified risk aversion among investors, leading to increased trading in precious metals as a protective measure against market volatility.

As silver continues its historic rally, the currency pair's movement reflects broader concerns affecting global markets. With escalating uncertainties surrounding trade policies, traders are positioning themselves to hedge against potential economic instability, favoring safe-haven assets like silver over riskier investments. This shift not only highlights silver's appeal but also signals a potential reallocation of capital among various currency pairs, impacting the overall exchange rate landscape.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) slipped below $4,350 during early European trading on Friday, reflecting a downturn driven by profit-taking activities. The decline emerged as shorter-term futures traders engaged in weak long liquidation, creating downward pressure on the precious metal. This movement comes amid ongoing speculation regarding potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which had previously boosted gold's appeal.

The current exchange rate dynamics indicate a struggle for gold to maintain upward momentum as market participants capitalize on recent gains. With the USD showing mixed performance against major currencies like the EUR, the market remains sensitive to shifts in economic indicators and Fed policy signals. As traders continue to assess the implications of any upcoming rate adjustments, gold may face further volatility in the near term.

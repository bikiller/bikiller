EUR/USD continues its upward momentum, trading around 1.1780 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This marks the second consecutive day of gains for the currency pair, as it approaches the significant 1.1800 barrier. Technical indicators suggest a strong bullish sentiment, with the pair consistently moving within an ascending channel pattern.

The recent climb in the EUR/USD exchange rate reflects growing confidence in the euro amid a stable economic outlook. Investors are closely monitoring developments that could influence the USD, particularly any shifts in monetary policy from the Federal Reserve. With the pair nearing two-month highs, market participants are keen to see if it can breach the 1.1800 level, which may signal further bullish momentum in the short term.

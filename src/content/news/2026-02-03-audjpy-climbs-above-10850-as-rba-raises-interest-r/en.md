The AUD/JPY currency pair surged above 108.50 during Tuesday’s Asian trading session, climbing to around 108.85 as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.85%. This move by the RBA signals a continued tightening of monetary policy to combat inflation, bolstering the Australian Dollar against the Japanese Yen.

The rate hike has strengthened the Australian Dollar, making it more attractive to investors in the forex market. As traders react to the RBA’s decision, the AUD/JPY exchange rate shows continued upward momentum. With expectations of further hikes in the future, the Australian Dollar could remain supported, while the Japanese Yen lags due to Japan's dovish stance.

The AUD/USD currency pair has seen some resistance following its strong rally, as it trades with a mild negative bias in the early European session on Thursday. Despite a notable move higher earlier in the week, the pair is now encountering difficulties in extending gains. At the time of writing, the exchange rate hovers just above the critical 0.7100 level, maintaining a bullish outlook as long as it holds above this threshold.

Traders are closely watching the 0.7100 support level, which is key for determining the next direction. A break above the recent high could trigger a continuation of the bullish trend, while failure to maintain support at 0.7100 could shift the balance in favor of sellers. With USD sentiment largely driving price action, any shifts in U.S. economic data or Fed policy will likely dictate the short-term movement of the AUD/USD pair.

Gold (XAU/USD) is struggling to extend its recent recovery from sub-$4,800 levels as it remains under pressure during the European session on Thursday. Despite an initial bounce, the precious metal faces resistance amid a firmer US Dollar (USD), which has surged to a two-week high. Market participants are cautious ahead of key US economic data, which could provide further direction.

The USD’s rebound from a four-year low has been a key factor weighing on gold’s momentum. As the dollar strengthens against major currencies, including the EUR, gold’s appeal diminishes for non-dollar buyers. Traders are closely monitoring upcoming US data, including inflation and employment reports, which could influence the USD’s trajectory and gold’s near-term outlook.

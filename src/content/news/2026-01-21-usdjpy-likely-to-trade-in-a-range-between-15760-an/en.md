The USD/JPY currency pair is expected to trade within a range of 157.60 to 158.60, according to analysts from UOB Group. This range suggests a period of consolidation for the US dollar, which has been oscillating between 157.10 and 159.10 in the longer term. 

Market dynamics indicate that traders should closely monitor this consolidation phase, as it reflects ongoing uncertainties in the forex market. With the exchange rate hovering within these technical levels, movements could be influenced by macroeconomic developments and geopolitical factors affecting both the US and Japan economies.

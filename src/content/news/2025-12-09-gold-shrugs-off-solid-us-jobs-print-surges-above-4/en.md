Gold (XAU/USD) continued its upward momentum on Tuesday, gaining 0.57% to reach $4,213, despite a robust jobs report from the United States. The positive employment data appears to have little impact on expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, with many analysts anticipating a rate cut in the upcoming meeting. The precious metal bounced from daily lows of $4,170, indicating strong support levels.

The resilience of gold amid favorable economic indicators reflects investor sentiment towards potential easing by the Fed, which could weaken the USD and boost demand for non-yielding assets like gold. As the market prepares for the Fed's decision, traders are closely monitoring the XAU/USD exchange rate, with implications for other currency pairs such as EUR/USD, as shifts in U.S. monetary policy often influence global forex markets.

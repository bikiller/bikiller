EUR/JPY saw a decline of 0.15% during the Asian session on Monday, falling to around 182.40. The currency pair faced pressure as the Japanese Yen gained appeal amid growing uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy. This shift was particularly noticeable as Japan entered its holiday period, where safe-haven assets tend to see increased demand.

The Yen's strength has pushed the EUR/JPY exchange rate lower, with traders reacting to concerns over potential changes in U.S. trade policies. This uncertainty in the USD outlook contributed to the Yen's rise, influencing the EUR/JPY pair's movement. As a result, market participants are closely watching developments related to U.S. trade dynamics, which could further impact cross-currency trading.

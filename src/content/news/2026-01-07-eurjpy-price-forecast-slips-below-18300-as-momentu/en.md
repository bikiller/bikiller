EUR/JPY has continued its downward trajectory, marking the fourth consecutive session of losses as it trades around 182.80 during European trading hours on Wednesday. This decline reflects a weakening momentum in the currency pair, which has slipped below the key psychological level of 183.00, indicating a shift in market sentiment.

The recent movements in EUR/JPY are likely influenced by various macroeconomic factors, including fluctuations in the euro and yen against the USD. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate for potential signs of stabilization or further declines, as sentiment remains cautious amidst ongoing global economic uncertainties. The ability of EUR/JPY to regain the 183.00 mark will be crucial for its short-term outlook.

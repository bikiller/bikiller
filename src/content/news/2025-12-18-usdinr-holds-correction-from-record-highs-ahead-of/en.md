The Indian Rupee (INR) is showing signs of recovery against the US Dollar (USD) as it trades higher, following a flat opening on Thursday. The USD/INR currency pair has dipped to approximately 90.50, reflecting growing market speculation that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) may step in once again to bolster the Rupee amidst persistent inflation concerns.

This corrective movement comes ahead of critical US inflation data, which could further influence trading dynamics. As traders closely monitor the exchange rate fluctuations, the potential for RBI intervention adds a layer of complexity to the market, underscoring the ongoing volatility and interconnectedness of currency pair movements in the global forex landscape.

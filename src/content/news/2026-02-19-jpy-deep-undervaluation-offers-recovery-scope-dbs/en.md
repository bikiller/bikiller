The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains deeply undervalued, according to DBS Group Research’s Chang Wei Liang, who highlights it as the most underpriced G10 currency based on the DBS Equilibrium Exchange Rate (DEER) metrics. The Yen’s weak position has seen it struggle against major currencies like the USD and EUR, with the USD/JPY trading at multi-decade highs.

This deep undervaluation suggests potential for recovery, particularly as global economic conditions evolve. The Yen’s current exchange rate presents an opportunity for traders, with the likelihood of a rebound if market conditions shift. As investors closely monitor the USD/JPY and EUR/JPY pairs, any changes in U.S. monetary policy or broader risk sentiment could trigger significant moves in these currency pairs, making the Yen a focal point in upcoming trading sessions.

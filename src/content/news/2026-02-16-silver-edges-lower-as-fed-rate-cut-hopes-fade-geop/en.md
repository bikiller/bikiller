Silver (XAG/USD) is trading around $76.50, reflecting a 0.70% decline on the day. The precious metal is struggling to maintain its recent gains, failing to extend its rebound as market sentiment turns cautious. This drop comes amid fading expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, which had previously supported silver's upward momentum.

Geopolitical tensions continue to weigh on global markets, contributing to the ongoing volatility in the forex space. Despite persistent uncertainties, silver has yet to capitalize on the risk-off sentiment. With the USD showing strength and Fed policy expectations shifting, traders remain cautious about silver's near-term outlook, especially with the lack of a clear bullish catalyst in the market.

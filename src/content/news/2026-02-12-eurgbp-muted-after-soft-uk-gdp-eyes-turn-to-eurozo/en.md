EUR/GBP remained largely unchanged on Wednesday, trading within a tight range as the British Pound (GBP) held steady despite disappointing UK GDP figures. The exchange rate saw little movement, with the currency pair staying around the 0.8700 mark. Weak UK economic data had limited impact on GBP, as the broader weakness in the US Dollar (USD) continued to influence overall market sentiment.

The focus now shifts to upcoming Eurozone data, which could provide fresh direction for EUR/GBP. While the British Pound remains resilient, market participants are keenly awaiting key Eurozone reports for further insights. The current market environment, shaped by USD weakness, may drive further fluctuations in the currency pair depending on the data's outcome.

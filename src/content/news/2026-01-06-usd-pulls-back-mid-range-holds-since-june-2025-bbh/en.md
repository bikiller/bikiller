The US Dollar (USD) has retraced from its recent gains, settling back towards mid-range levels that have persisted since June 2025. With no significant economic data scheduled for release today, trading activity in the forex market is expected to remain subdued. Analysts from BBH note that this stabilization reflects the ongoing uncertainty among investors regarding the USD's trajectory.

As the currency pairs remain within this established range, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rates for signs of a breakout. The EUR/USD pair, in particular, is a focal point, as fluctuations in the USD could influence its performance. Without fresh data to drive market sentiment, the USD’s current position may lead to a period of consolidation before any decisive movement emerges.

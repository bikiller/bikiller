The EUR/USD pair has extended its recovery, building on Friday’s rebound from a near one-month low around 1.1750-1.1740. The currency pair is gaining momentum as it looks to test the mid-1.1800s, with the USD showing signs of weakness across the board. This follows a broad decline in the greenback, which has lost ground due to softer U.S. economic data and investor sentiment.

As the week begins, the exchange rate has seen steady upward movement, supported by improving investor sentiment towards the euro. The pair’s recent recovery highlights market expectations for the EUR to continue benefiting from a weaker USD. Traders are now eyeing key technical levels, with the 1.1800 region acting as an important hurdle for further gains in the short term.

ING's FX analyst, Francesco Pesole, suggests that the EUR/USD exchange rate could see upward movement toward 1.16 and possibly reach as high as 1.17 to 1.1750. This potential rally may be supported by easing concerns over political risk related to the Federal Reserve, despite a lack of significant economic data from the euro zone and subdued messaging from the European Central Bank.

However, ongoing geopolitical tensions surrounding Greenland are casting a shadow over the overall market outlook. The interplay of these factors could influence trading strategies for both the euro and the Swedish krona (SEK), positioning them as potential beneficiaries in the evolving forex landscape. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments as they navigate the complexities of the currency markets.

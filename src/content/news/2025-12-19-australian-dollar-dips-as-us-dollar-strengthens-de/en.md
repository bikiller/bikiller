The Australian Dollar (AUD) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, reversing earlier gains as the greenback strengthened amid ongoing speculation regarding Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The AUD/USD pair fell to 0.6452, down 0.6% for the day, reflecting the currency's vulnerability amidst shifting market sentiment.

Despite expectations of Fed rate cuts, the USD's resilience has been bolstered by robust economic data and a hawkish stance from the central bank. The strengthening of the USD has pressured the AUD, as traders adjust their positions in response to evolving economic indicators. As the exchange rate continues to fluctuate, market participants are closely monitoring upcoming economic releases that could influence future trading strategies.

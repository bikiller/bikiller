The Pound Sterling (GBP) is showing strength against the US Dollar (USD) during the North American session on Wednesday, as market expectations shift towards a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve. With traders anticipating a rate cut from the Fed later in the day, GBP/USD has risen to 1.3336 after recovering from a low of 1.3296.

This upward movement in the GBP/USD exchange rate reflects growing optimism surrounding the Bank of England's policies as well. The combination of a weakening USD and a favorable outlook for the GBP could signal a shift in trading momentum, prompting investors to reassess their positions in this currency pair. As market dynamics evolve, the implications for broader forex trading strategies will be closely monitored.

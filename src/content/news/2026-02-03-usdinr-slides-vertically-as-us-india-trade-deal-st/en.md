The Indian Rupee (INR) strengthened sharply against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, following the confirmation of a long-awaited trade deal between the United States and India. The USD/INR pair opened with a gap down to 90.35, marking the lowest level in nearly three weeks. This sharp drop comes as the trade agreement boosts investor confidence in the Indian economy.

As the market reacted to the positive news, the INR continued its ascent, reflecting stronger economic ties between the two nations. The exchange rate movement highlights the growing impact of trade relations on currency dynamics, with the Indian Rupee benefiting from the deal’s expected economic boost. The trading session’s volatility underscores the sensitivity of the USD/INR pair to geopolitical developments.

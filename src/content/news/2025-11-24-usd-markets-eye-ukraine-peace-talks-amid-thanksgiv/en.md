The US Dollar (USD) is facing potential downside risks this week as market participants look toward cautiously optimistic Ukraine peace talks and the Federal Reserve's Beige Book for insights. These developments could temper the dollar's strength, keeping the Dollar Index (DXY) hovering near key resistance levels. Traders are closely monitoring the situation as sentiment shifts, particularly against major pairs like EUR/USD.

As Thanksgiving approaches, liquidity is expected to thin, potentially amplifying market movements. The interplay between geopolitical tensions and economic indicators will be crucial for the USD's exchange rate. If the peace talks yield positive outcomes, the resulting risk appetite may further pressure the dollar, impacting trading strategies across currency pairs and altering expectations for future Fed policy.

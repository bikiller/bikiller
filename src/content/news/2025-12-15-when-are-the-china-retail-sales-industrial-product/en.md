The National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) will release crucial economic data on November retail sales and industrial production at 02:00 GMT. Retail sales are forecasted to rise by 2.9% year-over-year, while industrial production is expected to increase by 5.0%, up from the previous 4.9%. These figures could significantly impact the AUD/USD exchange rate, as traders respond to shifts in China's economic health.

A stronger-than-expected performance in these indicators may bolster the Australian dollar, given Australia's trade ties with China. Conversely, disappointing results could drive the AUD/USD lower, as concerns over global demand might weigh on market sentiment. Traders will closely monitor these releases for potential volatility in the currency pair and broader market reactions.

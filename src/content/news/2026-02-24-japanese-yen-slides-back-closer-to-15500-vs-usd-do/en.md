The USD/JPY currency pair is seeing a slight upward movement in early Tuesday trading, climbing back toward the 155.00 level after bouncing from the 154.00 support in the previous session. This trend suggests a potential for further gains, but with downside risk appearing limited at current levels.

Despite the recent gains, the Japanese Yen’s downside potential against the US Dollar remains constrained. The 154.00 mark continues to serve as solid support, offering resilience to the Yen’s decline. Traders are likely to keep an eye on any developments that could shift the exchange rate significantly beyond these key levels.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing a slight decline against the U.S. Dollar (USD), continuing its overnight pullback from a four-day low. During the Asian session on Friday, the currency pair showed a mild negative bias, reflecting ongoing market trends influenced by the differing monetary policies of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve.

This divergence in policy is expected to limit the Yen's potential for deeper losses, as traders remain cautious amid fluctuating exchange rates. As the JPY trades lower, the implications for Japan’s economy could be significant, particularly concerning import costs and inflation pressures. The market will be closely watching for further developments in both central banks’ strategies to gauge future currency movements.

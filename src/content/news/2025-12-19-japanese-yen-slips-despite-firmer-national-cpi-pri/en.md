The Japanese Yen (JPY) faced renewed selling pressure during the Asian session on Friday, pushing the currency closer to recent weekly lows against the US Dollar (USD). Despite a stronger National Consumer Price Index (CPI) print indicating economic resilience, traders remained cautious as they await insights from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) regarding its monetary policy direction.

As trading progressed, the USD/JPY exchange rate edged upward, with the pair hovering near its previous day’s peak.

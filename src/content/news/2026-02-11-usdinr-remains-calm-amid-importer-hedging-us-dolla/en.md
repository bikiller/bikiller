USD/INR remained largely stable on Wednesday, following a slight dip in the previous session. The currency pair was mostly unmoved, with the Indian Rupee (INR) benefiting from strong equity inflows and a broad weakness in the US Dollar (USD). Despite this, the INR's upward momentum faced resistance as local corporate demand for the Greenback continued to limit gains.

The exchange rate for USD/INR remains cautious, with the rupee unable to build on its earlier improvements. While external factors such as USD weakness provided support, sustained corporate hedging by importers and continued demand for USD capped any potential rallies in the Indian currency. Traders remain watchful of any shifts in US Dollar strength, which could dictate the next movement for the pair.

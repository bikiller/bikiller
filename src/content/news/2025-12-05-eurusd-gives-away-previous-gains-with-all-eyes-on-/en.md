EUR/USD has surrendered its earlier gains during the European trading session, reflecting a cautious market sentiment ahead of critical US inflation data. The currency pair is currently trading at 1.1647, exhibiting minimal movement on the daily chart. This slight decline underscores the market's focus on upcoming economic indicators that could influence the US dollar's strength.

Traders are closely monitoring the inflation figures, as they hold significant implications for future Federal Reserve policy decisions. A higher-than-expected inflation report could bolster the USD, potentially driving the EUR/USD exchange rate lower. Conversely, weaker inflation data might offer support to the euro, prompting a rebound in the currency pair. Market participants remain on edge as they await the data release, which is likely to steer trading direction in the coming sessions.

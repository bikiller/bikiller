The EUR/USD currency pair faced downward pressure in early European trading on Wednesday, slipping below the 1.1850 mark. The exchange rate traded near 1.1840 as renewed demand for the US Dollar (USD) weighed on the Euro (EUR). Market participants are closely watching for any hints from the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes, set to be released later in the day.

The minutes are expected to provide insights into potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, which could influence USD sentiment and impact the EUR/USD exchange rate. Traders are positioned cautiously ahead of the release, with market expectations shifting depending on the Fed's outlook for monetary policy. A hawkish tone could bolster the USD further, while dovish signals may offer support to the Euro.

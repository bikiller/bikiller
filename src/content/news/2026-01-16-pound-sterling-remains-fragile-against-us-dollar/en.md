The Pound Sterling (GBP) is currently treading cautiously against the US Dollar (USD), hovering near a four-week low around 1.3360 during the European trading session on Friday. This recent downturn reflects ongoing market uncertainties and pressures, as investors remain wary of economic indicators and geopolitical factors influencing the currency pair.

As GBP/USD trades in this fragile territory, traders are closely monitoring key levels for potential reversal signals. A sustained breach below the 1.3360 mark could trigger further sell-offs, while a rebound may depend on upcoming data and developments that could shift market sentiment. The overall exchange rate dynamics are shaping a cautious outlook for the Pound as it navigates through a challenging landscape.

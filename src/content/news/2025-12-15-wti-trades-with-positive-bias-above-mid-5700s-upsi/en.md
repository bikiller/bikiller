West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are experiencing a positive trend, trading above the mid-$57.00s during the Asian session on Monday. This shift comes as the market sees some buying interest, marking a brief recovery after a two-day losing streak. However, upside potential appears limited, suggesting traders should remain cautious about significant gains in the near term.

As WTI finds support above $57.00, market participants are closely monitoring global demand dynamics and geopolitical factors that could influence price movements. While the recent uptick in prices offers a glimmer of hope for bullish traders, the broader sentiment remains cautious amid fluctuating economic indicators and exchange rate movements in currencies like the USD and EUR, which could impact trading strategies in the oil market.

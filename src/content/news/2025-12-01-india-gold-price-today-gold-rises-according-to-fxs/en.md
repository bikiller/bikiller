Gold prices in India experienced an upward movement on Monday, as reported by FXStreet. The rise reflects broader trends in global commodities, influenced by fluctuations in the USD and shifts in investor sentiment. This increase indicates a growing demand for safe-haven assets amid ongoing market volatility.

As traders navigate currency pairs like USD/INR and EUR/INR, gold's performance could signal shifts in the exchange rate dynamics. The current technical levels suggest that traders may find resistance and support points critical for future trading decisions.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) have entered negative territory, trading close to $4,210 in the early Asian session on Wednesday. Traders are bracing for a potentially hawkish cut from the Federal Reserve, which has created a bearish sentiment in the market. The ongoing anticipation regarding the Fed's monetary policy decisions is influencing risk appetite among investors, causing a decline in gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset.

As the market digests the implications of potential rate adjustments, the exchange rate reflects the sensitivity of gold to shifts in USD strength. A further increase in interest rates could pressure gold prices, leading traders to reassess their positions in the currency pair. Ultimately, the outlook for gold will depend heavily on upcoming economic data and the Fed's stance on inflation and interest rates.

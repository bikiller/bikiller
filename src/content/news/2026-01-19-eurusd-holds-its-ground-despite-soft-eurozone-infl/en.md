EUR/USD is displaying resilience, holding steady at 1.1620 despite disappointing inflation data from the Eurozone. Earlier in the day, the currency pair experienced a dip to seven-week lows of 1.1585 before recovering. This bounce indicates a potential stabilization as traders weigh the implications of the soft inflation figures on the European Central Bank's monetary policy.

The exchange rate's movement reflects the ongoing volatility in the market, with traders closely monitoring economic indicators that could influence the USD and EUR dynamics. As sentiment shifts, the recent price action suggests that the pair may continue to navigate a tight range, with investors now looking ahead to upcoming economic releases for further direction.

The AUD/JPY currency pair has slipped 0.4%, trading near 109.20 in early European hours on Thursday. This retracement follows a record high of 110.1 reached on Wednesday, as the Japanese Yen (JPY) recovers after a three-day decline. The Yen’s brief rebound comes amid ongoing market volatility, providing some support to the JPY against its counterparts.

Despite the pullback, the outlook for AUD/JPY remains largely optimistic. Traders are closely watching for any further developments in the Yen’s strength, with key technical levels around 109.00 and 110.1 shaping the pair's near-term trajectory. The broader market sentiment suggests that the Australian Dollar (AUD) continues to hold strong amid global risk appetite, leaving AUD/JPY well-positioned for potential gains once Yen momentum fades.

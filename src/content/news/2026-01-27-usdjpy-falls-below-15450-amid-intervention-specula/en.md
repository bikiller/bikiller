The USD/JPY pair dropped to an 11-week low of 154.20 in the early Asian session on Tuesday, marking a significant decline. The Japanese Yen gained momentum against the US Dollar amid growing speculation of a possible intervention by Japanese and US authorities to stabilize the exchange rate. This shift came as concerns about the Yen’s recent weakness prompted discussions of coordinated market action.

As the USD/JPY trading pair fell below the key 154.50 level, traders closely monitored the potential for intervention. The strengthening of the Yen reflects growing fears over the potential impact of continued Dollar strength, which has led to mounting volatility in global forex markets. The outcome of such intervention efforts remains uncertain, but it adds a layer of caution to trading in the USD/JPY.

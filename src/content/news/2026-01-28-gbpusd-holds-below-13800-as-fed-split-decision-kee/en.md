GBP/USD remains capped below the 1.3800 mark as market participants digest the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady. The Fed's decision was split, with a 10-2 vote in favor of maintaining the current rate. Two members of the committee pushed for a 25 basis point rate cut, adding an element of uncertainty to future monetary policy. This hawkish stance from the Fed has supported the USD, keeping the pair under pressure.

The lack of movement above 1.3800 indicates that traders are cautious amid mixed signals from the Federal Reserve. As the USD remains firm, the GBP is struggling to gain significant momentum, reflecting ongoing concerns over global growth and domestic economic challenges. The Fed’s divided stance suggests the possibility of further volatility in the currency pair, with traders awaiting more clarity on future rate decisions.

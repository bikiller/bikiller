During Friday's European trading session, several European Central Bank (ECB) officials emphasized their commitment to a neutral policy stance, citing that inflation projections remain anchored. These comments came amid ongoing market speculation about future ECB moves, with the EUR/USD exchange rate holding steady around the 1.0850 level. The remarks indicate no immediate shift in interest rate policy despite fluctuating inflationary pressures.

The euro remained largely unaffected by the ECB's stance, with the EUR/USD trading in a tight range as investors awaited further economic data. The central bank's cautious approach signals that interest rate hikes may not be imminent, keeping the currency pair in a consolidation phase. Traders are now focusing on upcoming inflation figures and global economic developments to gauge the ECB's next steps.

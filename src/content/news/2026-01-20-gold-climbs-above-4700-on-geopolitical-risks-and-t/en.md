Gold (XAU/USD) surged past the $4,700 mark on Tuesday, driven by escalating geopolitical tensions and fears surrounding a potential trade war. As safe-haven demand intensified, the precious metal reached an exchange rate of approximately $4,720, just shy of its all-time high of $4,737. This surge reflects traders' growing concerns over global instability, prompting a shift toward gold as a preferred investment.

The climb in gold prices indicates a broader market sentiment favoring stability amid uncertainty. As geopolitical risks remain elevated, the demand for gold is likely to persist, impacting its trading dynamics against other currencies, particularly the USD. Investors are closely watching these developments, which could further influence the exchange rates of major currency pairs in the coming sessions.

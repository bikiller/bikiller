Silver prices (XAG/USD) surged past $91, extending its gains for the third consecutive day. The rally follows a recent U.S. inflation report, which stoked fears of rising costs. Investors flocked to the safe haven of silver, despite the U.S. Dollar (USD) holding firm. At the time of writing, the currency pair XAG/USD traded around $91.39, marking an impressive 3% rise.

The sharp move in silver was driven by hot Producer Price Index (PPI) data and growing concerns over potential tariffs, which added pressure to inflation expectations. As inflation fears mount, demand for precious metals, particularly silver, increases. This shift in sentiment is seen as a hedge against economic uncertainty, even as the USD remains stable against other major currencies like the Euro (EUR).

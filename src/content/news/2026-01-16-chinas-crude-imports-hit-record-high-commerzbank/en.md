China's crude oil imports reached a historic peak in December and throughout 2025, according to Commerzbank's commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch. This surge is largely attributed to increased refinery operations and aggressive stockpiling strategies. The influx of crude is expected to impact global oil prices, which could subsequently influence the USD/CNY exchange rate as traders react to supply dynamics.

As the demand for crude oil strengthens in China, the implications for forex markets could be significant. The potential rise in oil prices may lead to shifts in trading positions for currency pairs, particularly those involving the USD and EUR. Market participants will likely keep a close watch on how this increased import volume affects broader economic indicators and exchange rates in the coming months.

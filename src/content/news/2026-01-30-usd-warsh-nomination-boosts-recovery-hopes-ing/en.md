The USD is gaining momentum as market expectations rise for Kevin Warsh's nomination as the next Federal Reserve Chair. Analysts see this potential appointment as a catalyst for a Dollar recovery, which has struggled in recent months. The news sparked optimism among traders, boosting demand for the USD across the board. As a result, the USD/JPY pair is approaching key resistance levels at 135.50, while the EUR/USD is testing support near 1.0700.

The Dollar's strength is likely to continue if Warsh's nomination proceeds, with the potential for a hawkish stance on interest rates. Traders are closely watching these developments, as the USD's performance remains sensitive to Federal Reserve policies. A continued bullish trend in the USD could pressure EUR/USD towards the 1.0600 mark and strengthen the USD/JPY exchange rate above the 136.00 threshold. The market’s focus will remain on Warsh’s confirmation and the broader implications for monetary policy.

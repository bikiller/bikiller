GBP/USD has posted modest gains as traders brace for the Bank of England's (BoE) upcoming meeting. The British pound is currently outperforming other G10 currencies, reflecting a shift in sentiment ahead of the decision. Recent UK economic data has tempered expectations for rate cuts, with a 25 basis point reduction now priced in by June. 

The market's focus remains on the BoE's stance, with the exchange rate staying resilient against the USD. As the trading session progresses, GBP/USD has gained momentum, indicating a slight bullish outlook. With the possibility of a rate cut this summer, the currency pair's movement could hinge on further updates from the central bank.

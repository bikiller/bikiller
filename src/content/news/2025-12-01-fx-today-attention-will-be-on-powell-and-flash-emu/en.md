The US Dollar (USD) is experiencing significant downward pressure, retreating towards multi-week lows as traders brace for a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, anticipated as early as next week. This sentiment has led to a cautious trading atmosphere, particularly affecting major currency pairs such as EUR/USD, where the exchange rate remains sensitive to shifts in U.S. monetary policy.

Market attention is now focused on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming remarks, which could further influence the USD's trajectory. Additionally, the release of flash Eurozone Consumer Price Index (CPI) data is expected to impact the EUR's performance against the USD. As speculation mounts over these pivotal events, investors are closely watching key technical levels to gauge future trading opportunities within the forex market.

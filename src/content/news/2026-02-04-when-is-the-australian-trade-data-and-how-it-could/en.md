The Australian Bureau of Statistics will release its December trade data on Thursday at 00:30 GMT. Analysts expect Australia’s trade surplus to widen to $3,300 million, up from $2,936 million in November. This increase may bolster the Australian Dollar (AUD) as traders react to stronger-than-expected trade figures, potentially pushing the AUD/USD exchange rate higher.

Traders will closely watch the impact on the AUD/USD pair, with a wider surplus reinforcing the Australian economy's strength. If the data aligns with expectations or surpasses forecasts, the Australian Dollar could gain momentum against the US Dollar (USD), potentially testing resistance levels. Conversely, any disappointment in the numbers might lead to a pullback in AUD/USD.

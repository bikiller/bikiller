The USD/JPY currency pair is anticipated to trade within a range of 157.90 to 158.80, according to analysts at UOB Group. This stability in the exchange rate suggests a cautious approach from traders as they monitor broader economic indicators and geopolitical developments influencing the U.S. dollar.

Looking ahead, the USD appears to have entered a consolidation phase between 157.10 and 159.10. This range-bound movement indicates a potential pause in volatility, allowing market participants to reassess their positions and strategies, particularly in light of changes in monetary policy and economic data releases affecting the dollar and yen.

AUD/JPY surged to a near two-week high, touching 110.70 during the early European session on Wednesday. The Australian Dollar gained momentum against the Japanese Yen following hotter-than-expected inflation data from Australia, which fueled speculation of a rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in May. This jump in the exchange rate signals increased bullish sentiment in the currency pair.

The surprise inflation figures have heightened expectations for tightening monetary policy, pushing traders to reassess their positions. As the Aussie continues to strengthen, market participants are closely monitoring further economic data for signs of sustained inflationary pressure, which could influence the RBA's next move. The 110.50 level now stands as a key technical support, with further gains possible if the bullish momentum persists.

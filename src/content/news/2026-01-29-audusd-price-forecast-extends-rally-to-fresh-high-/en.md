The AUD/USD currency pair has continued its robust rally, reaching a fresh high of approximately 0.7100 during the Asian trading session on Thursday. This marks the highest level for the Australian dollar against the US dollar since February 2023, reflecting a sustained bullish trend over the past two weeks. 

Factors contributing to this upward momentum include positive economic indicators from Australia and a generally softer USD as markets react to varying interest rate expectations. As traders closely monitor the exchange rate, further movements in the AUD/USD could be influenced by upcoming economic data releases and shifts in market sentiment.

The EUR/JPY currency pair is trading flat at approximately 181.10 in the early European session on Thursday. Market participants are closely watching this exchange rate as the release of Eurozone retail sales data approaches. The outcome could significantly influence trading strategies and investor sentiment.

Meanwhile, hawkish expectations surrounding a potential interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) may lend support to the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the Euro (EUR). As traders assess the implications of BoJ's monetary policy on the exchange rate, any shift could provide insight into the future trajectory of EUR/JPY trading, affecting broader market movements in the forex landscape.

Market activity was subdued on Thursday, November 27, as traders observed the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the United States. The EUR/USD currency pair remained steady, trading around 1.1900, reflecting a 0.2% shift from the previous session. With many traders off the desk, volatility decreased, leading to narrow trading ranges across major currency pairs.

In the absence of significant economic data, the USD held its ground against the JPY, with the exchange rate hovering near 104.50. The lack of market catalysts may result in thin liquidity, which could cause erratic price movements as the week winds down. As investors prepare for the upcoming weeks, attention will shift towards any geopolitical developments and economic indicators that could influence trading sentiment in December.

EUR/USD is experiencing a modest uptick for the second consecutive day, trading higher as markets await crucial economic data. The Euro has edged up against the US Dollar, with the exchange rate hovering around 1.0830, marking a slight advance of 0.1%. Investors are positioning themselves ahead of the upcoming Eurozone services PMI and inflation figures, which are expected to provide more clarity on the region's economic health.

Market sentiment remains cautious as traders look for further direction in the Euro. A stronger-than-expected services PMI or inflation data could bolster the EUR/USD pair, pushing it closer to the key resistance level at 1.0850. Conversely, weaker data may trigger a reversal, sending the currency pair back towards recent support around 1.0800. As the European session unfolds, traders are likely to adjust their positions based on the data, adding volatility to the market.

Societe Generale's Kunal Kundu highlighted recent developments in the US-India trade deal, with the US agreeing to reduce tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%. This move is expected to enhance trade between the two nations, potentially impacting the INR/USD exchange rate. While India is anticipated to remove tariffs on US products, there is uncertainty about the zero-tariff access and the country's ongoing Russian oil imports, which could affect future trading dynamics.

The lack of clarity regarding these details has left traders cautious, as the Indian Rupee (INR) may face volatility depending on the outcome. With the US dollar (USD) weakening against other major currencies like the Euro (EUR), any shifts in India’s trade policies could influence broader market sentiment. Investors will likely monitor the USD/INR pair closely, especially if these trade negotiations create further pressure on the rupee.

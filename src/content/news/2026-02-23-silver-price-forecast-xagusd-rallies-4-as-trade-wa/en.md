Silver prices soared 4% on Monday, as fears surrounding the trade war and geopolitical tensions sparked a surge in safe-haven demand. The XAG/USD currency pair jumped alongside Gold, benefiting from heightened investor uncertainty. The rally was driven by concerns over trade policy shifts, as well as the broader market risk-off sentiment, pushing investors towards precious metals.

With the silver price moving in tandem with gold, the XAG/USD exchange rate found support near key technical levels.

The uptick highlights a shift in market sentiment, where geopolitical risks and trade war developments are outweighing other economic factors.

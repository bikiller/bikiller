EUR/GBP saw a positive start to the week, climbing to 0.8720, up by 0.38% on Monday. The move comes amid an improvement in sentiment within the Eurozone, which boosted the euro against the British pound. The currency pair's strengthening reflects growing optimism for the euro, supported by stable economic data and expectations of continued policy support.

At the same time, the British pound faces headwinds due to ongoing political uncertainty in the UK, keeping traders cautious. The uncertainty surrounding domestic policies and potential disruptions to economic recovery continues to weigh on the pound. This has led to a divergence in the performance of EUR/GBP, with the euro gaining ground as the pound remains under pressure.

The EUR/USD currency pair is currently experiencing a range-trading phase, with anticipated fluctuations confined between the technical levels of 1.1595 and 1.1645. This trading behavior suggests a market balancing act, where traders are likely reacting to broader economic indicators and sentiment surrounding both the Euro and the US dollar.

As investors monitor economic data releases and geopolitical developments, the stability within this narrow trading range reflects uncertainty in market direction. The exchange rate movement indicates that both currencies are struggling for dominance, leading to a cautious approach among traders as they navigate potential breakout scenarios in the near term.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) surged on Friday, rising by 0.5% against the US Dollar (USD) following a strong jobs report. January’s labor market data revealed a drop in the unemployment rate to 6.5%, its lowest since September 2024. The positive employment figures boosted market sentiment, fueling demand for the Loonie.

This shift in the CAD/USD exchange rate reflects growing confidence in the Canadian economy. The unemployment decline suggests resilience in the labor market, potentially influencing future monetary policy decisions from the Bank of Canada. Traders will now closely monitor any additional economic data to gauge the currency’s near-term trajectory.

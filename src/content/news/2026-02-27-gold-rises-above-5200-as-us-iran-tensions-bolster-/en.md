Gold (XAU/USD) continues to climb, rising above $5,200 on Friday as geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran intensify. Reports indicating that US officials have urged nonessential embassy staff in Israel to leave have fueled fears of military escalation. These developments have driven investors toward safe-haven assets, boosting demand for gold and reinforcing its price movement.

The precious metal is now testing the upper boundary of its weekly trading range, supported by broader market uncertainty. As global markets react to potential conflict in the Middle East, the XAU/USD exchange rate sees notable volatility, with investors seeking refuge in gold. This demand shift has helped lift prices, positioning gold as a strong contender for further gains amid growing geopolitical risks.

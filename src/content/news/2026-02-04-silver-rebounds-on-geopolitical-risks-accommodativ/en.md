Silver (XAG/USD) is gaining momentum, marking its second consecutive day of recovery, as it climbs to $89.70, up 5.50% on the day. This rebound comes amid rising geopolitical risks and expectations of continued accommodative policy from the Federal Reserve. Market participants are closely watching these developments, with silver benefiting from risk aversion.

The currency pair's move reflects broader market sentiment, where investors are increasingly seeking safe-haven assets. The dollar's weakness amid Fed dovish expectations is also playing a role, enhancing silver’s appeal as an alternative investment. As geopolitical tensions persist, silver could maintain its upward trajectory, with key technical levels now watching the $90 threshold for further direction.

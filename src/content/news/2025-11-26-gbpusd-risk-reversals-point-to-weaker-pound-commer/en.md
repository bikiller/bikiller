GBP/USD is facing increased downside pressure, as market-implied volatility and risk reversals suggest a weakening Pound Sterling ahead of the UK Budget. Commerzbank's FX analyst, Michael Pfister, highlights that the exchange rate's outlook is contingent on a credible fiscal plan from Chancellor Reeves, which is essential for restoring investor confidence in the currency pair.

As traders prepare for the upcoming budget announcement, sentiment around GBP is cautious. Current volatility indicators are reflecting heightened uncertainty, with expectations that the Pound may struggle against the USD in the near term. The dynamics of the market suggest that without a solid fiscal strategy, GBP may continue to underperform, impacting overall trading strategies for those involved in the GBP/USD pair.

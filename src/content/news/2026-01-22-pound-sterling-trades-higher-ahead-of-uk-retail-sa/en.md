Pound Sterling trades higher during the European trading session, outperforming most major currencies as investors position ahead of key UK data releases. The GBP strengthens against the USD and EUR, while lagging versus antipodean currencies. The exchange rate support comes after UK Consumer Price Index data for December surprised to the upside, reinforcing expectations that inflation pressures remain sticky.

The stronger-than-expected CPI reading has boosted demand for the British currency in forex trading, as it challenges assumptions of rapid policy easing by the Bank of England. Currency pairs such as GBP/USD and EUR/GBP reflect improved sentiment, with traders reassessing near-term interest rate expectations. The move highlights how inflation data continues to dominate market positioning across major FX pairs.

Attention now turns to upcoming UK Retail Sales and flash PMI figures, which could further influence Pound Sterling’s trajectory. Solid activity data may extend gains and keep the currency pair supported near recent technical levels, while softer releases could trigger profit-taking. In the broader market, movements in the USD and risk-sensitive currencies are likely to shape short-term trading dynamics.

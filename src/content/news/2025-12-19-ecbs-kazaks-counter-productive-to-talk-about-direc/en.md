During the European trading session, Mārtiņš Kazāks, a member of the European Central Bank (ECB) and governor of the Central Bank of Latvia, emphasized that discussing the direction of interest rates can be counter-productive. His remarks suggest a stable outlook for the eurozone economy, contributing to solid consumer inflation expectations that are well-anchored.

In forex markets, Kazāks’ comments have helped maintain the EUR/USD exchange rate, which remains steady around 1.0700. Traders are closely monitoring eurozone inflation data, as any shifts could affect future ECB policy decisions. The current stability in inflation expectations may lessen the volatility in EUR trading, providing a clearer picture of the euro's performance against major currencies like the USD.

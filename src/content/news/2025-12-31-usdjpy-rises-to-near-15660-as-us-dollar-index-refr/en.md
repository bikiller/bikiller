The USD/JPY currency pair climbed 0.2% to approach 156.60 during the late Asian trading session on Wednesday, reflecting a bullish trend driven by a stronger US Dollar. This upward movement follows the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from December's policy meeting, which provided insights that have bolstered market confidence in the dollar's strength.

As the US Dollar Index reached a weekly high, traders responded positively, contributing to the rise in the USD/JPY exchange rate. The implications of this movement could signal ongoing support for the USD, especially as market participants assess future Federal Reserve policies and their potential impact on the currency landscape.

The USD/KRW exchange rate is expected to remain volatile as strong foreign equity outflows and AI-related valuation concerns weigh on the Korean won (KRW). Despite a notable boost from semiconductor exports, the KRW has struggled, underperforming against the US dollar. This has led to a volatile trading environment with significant fluctuations in the currency pair's value.

MUFG highlights that the ongoing challenges for KRW stem from external pressures, particularly foreign investment shifts and market uncertainty surrounding artificial intelligence. These factors contribute to a negative outlook for the currency, with the USD/KRW continuing to experience heightened volatility. This dynamic presents potential risks for traders navigating the South Korean currency.

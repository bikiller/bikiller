The US Dollar stayed on the defensive after the Federal Reserve delivered a hawkish hold, reinforcing higher-for-longer rate expectations but failing to spark sustained USD buying. In FX trading on Wednesday, the US Dollar Index rebounded above 96.60, recovering modestly from recent lows as traders reassessed policy signals and near-term exchange rate risks.

Support for the USD came after White House Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reiterated that the United States maintains a strong-dollar policy, arguing that underlying fundamentals remain sound. He also dismissed speculation that authorities were intervening in currency markets to support the Japanese Yen, easing concerns of official action and allowing USD/JPY to stabilize after recent volatility.

Despite the bounce in DXY, broader sentiment toward the USD remains cautious. Major currency pairs such as EUR/USD continue to reflect investor uncertainty over growth, policy divergence, and global capital flows. For traders, the focus now shifts to whether the Dollar can build on the 96.60 level or resumes its downward trend amid shifting macro and central bank expectations.

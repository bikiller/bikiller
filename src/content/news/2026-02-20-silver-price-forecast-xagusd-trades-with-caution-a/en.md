Silver (XAG/USD) is trading cautiously at $78.40 during the late Asian session on Friday, as investors await key US economic data. The white metal has been consolidating in a narrow range ahead of the US Q4 GDP report, set to be released at 13:30 GMT. Market participants are watching closely, with the data expected to provide fresh insights into the strength of the US economy and potential future monetary policy moves by the Federal Reserve.

The upcoming GDP data could influence the US dollar's performance and, by extension, impact XAG/USD trading. If the US economy shows stronger-than-expected growth, the dollar could strengthen, putting downward pressure on silver prices. Conversely, weaker-than-anticipated growth could prompt a more dovish outlook from the Fed, potentially offering support to silver as a safe-haven asset. With the market in a cautious mood, volatility is expected to rise once the data is released.

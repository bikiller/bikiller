The USD/CHF currency pair is under mild pressure, trading around 0.7690 during the European session on Tuesday. The Swiss Franc has seen slight selling, while the US Dollar (USD) remains relatively stable as traders await the opening of US markets after an extended weekend. This subdued movement comes amid a broader calm in global markets, with little to drive significant volatility in the pair.

Despite the slight dip, the USD/CHF remains close to key technical support levels, with 0.7700 marking a psychological threshold. The pair’s movement reflects limited momentum ahead of the US market’s return, leaving traders cautious and focused on upcoming economic data for clearer direction. The market is expected to become more active once US trading picks up, which could see the pair either consolidating or experiencing stronger moves, depending on the broader dollar sentiment.

NZD/USD retreated from a six-month peak on Friday, trading around 0.6035 at the time of writing, down roughly 0.70% on the day. The pullback snapped a winning streak that had been in place since mid-January, as the exchange rate eased after testing 0.6094 in the previous session. Trading activity reflected a shift toward consolidation after recent gains.

The correction was driven largely by profit-taking in the New Zealand Dollar alongside a firm rebound in the US Dollar. Broad-based USD demand resurfaced as investors reassessed positioning across major currency pairs, lending support to the greenback against both the NZD and peers such as the EUR. The move highlighted the market’s sensitivity to changes in USD momentum after an extended period of weakness.

From a market perspective, the setback does little to alter the broader near-term outlook but signals that upside momentum in NZD/USD may slow without fresh catalysts. Traders are likely to monitor whether the pair can hold above the 0.6000 psychological level, while developments in USD flows and movements in related pairs like EUR/USD could shape near-term forex trading dynamics.

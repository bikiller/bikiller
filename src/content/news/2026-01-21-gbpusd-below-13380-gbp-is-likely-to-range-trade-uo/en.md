The GBP/USD currency pair is experiencing a mixed trading outlook, with analysts from UOB Group suggesting that the exchange rate is likely to range-trade below the 1.3380 level. While there is a near-term bullish bias for the Pound Sterling (GBP), resistance is anticipated near 1.3505, potentially capping upward movement. 

Market participants are advised to watch for these key levels, as a failure to break above 1.3505 could lead to sideways trading, limiting the GBP's gains against the US Dollar (USD). As traders navigate this dynamic landscape, fluctuations in economic data and geopolitical developments will remain crucial in determining the future trajectory of this currency pair.

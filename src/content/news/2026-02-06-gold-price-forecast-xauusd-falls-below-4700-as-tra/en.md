Gold (XAU/USD) fell below $4,700 early Friday, reaching a low of $4,680 during the Asian session. The precious metal continued its downward trend as traders closed positions and took profits, following losses in equities. With market participants adjusting their portfolios, the gold price reflects cautious sentiment amid broader market fluctuations.

The decline comes ahead of the release of the preliminary Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for February, which could influence the trading direction later in the day. As traders react to incoming economic data, the exchange rate for XAU/USD remains volatile, with gold prices expected to remain sensitive to any shifts in sentiment across global markets.

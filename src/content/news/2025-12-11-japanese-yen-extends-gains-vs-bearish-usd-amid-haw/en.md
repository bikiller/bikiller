The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued to strengthen against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, building on its recent momentum driven by a hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and contrasting dovish outlook from the Federal Reserve. The USD/JPY exchange rate saw a notable decline as the Yen gained traction for the second consecutive day, reflecting a shift in market sentiment.

As traders reacted to the divergence in monetary policy, the JPY appreciated against the USD, with the currency pair trading below key technical levels. This movement underscores the ongoing pressure on the USD amidst concerns over the Fed's potential easing, while the BoJ's commitment to maintain its current stance bolsters confidence in the JPY.

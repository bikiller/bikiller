USD/CHF continues its downward momentum for the second consecutive day, dropping 0.14%. The currency pair has remained within a narrow range of 0.7718 to 0.7757 over the past three days, showing limited movement. Currently, USD/CHF is trading at 0.7729, slightly above the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 0.7726, indicating minor support at this level.

The pair's consolidation within a bearish triangle pattern suggests a potential breakdown, with further losses possible if it fails to hold above the SMA. Traders are closely monitoring this range, as a sustained break below 0.7718 could signal deeper declines for the USD against the Swiss franc. The lack of significant movement reflects a cautious market, awaiting further direction.

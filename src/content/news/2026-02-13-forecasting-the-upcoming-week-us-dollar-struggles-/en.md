The US Dollar (USD) faced significant pressure over the past week, hovering around 96.80 against a basket of major currencies. Although the currency initially gained some ground following the release of better-than-expected US jobs data, the rally proved short-lived. The January Nonfarm Payrolls report showed 130K new jobs were added, pushing the Unemployment Rate down to 4.3% from 4.4%. Despite the positive data, the USD failed to hold onto its gains, with market sentiment focused on upcoming events.

As traders look ahead to next week, the focus shifts to key economic events, including the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data and comments from Federal Reserve officials. The PCE report is expected to provide further clues on inflation, while the remarks from Fed speakers may offer insights into the central bank's monetary policy stance. With the USD struggling near the 96.80 level, traders will be closely monitoring these developments to gauge the next potential move in currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

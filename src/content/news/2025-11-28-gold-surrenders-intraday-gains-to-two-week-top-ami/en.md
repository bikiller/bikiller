Gold (XAU/USD) has retreated from its recent highs, giving up significant intraday gains that brought it close to the $4,200 level, a peak not seen in two weeks. During the first half of the European session on Friday, the precious metal slipped back toward the lower end of its daily trading range as demand for the USD resurged, impacting the exchange rate dynamics.

The renewed strength of the US dollar is likely influencing gold's volatility, as traders reassess their positions amid shifting market sentiment. This reversal highlights the ongoing interplay between gold's safe-haven appeal and the dollar's performance, with potential implications for future trading strategies and currency pair movements in the forex market.

EUR/USD is holding steady near the 1.1800 level on Wednesday, reflecting a modest increase of 0.10% for the day. Earlier in the trading session, the currency pair reached its highest point since late September, driven by ongoing thin liquidity in the markets and a divergence in monetary policy between the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve. 

As traders navigate through these conditions, the exchange rate remains sensitive to economic data releases and geopolitical developments. The sustained strength of the euro against the USD may suggest a cautious optimism among investors, although any shifts in policy outlook could quickly alter the dynamics in this currency pair.

The US Dollar Index is stabilizing near the 96.00 mark during European trading hours on Wednesday, snapping a four-day losing streak as traders position ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision. The modest rebound reflects cautious USD buying after recent declines, with market participants reluctant to take aggressive positions before clarity on interest rates and forward guidance.

Trading conditions remain subdued across major currency pairs, with EUR/USD and GBP/USD consolidating as the greenback regains limited traction. The exchange rate dynamics suggest short-term dollar support around the 96.00 psychological level, though upside momentum appears constrained. Recent selling pressure had pushed the index lower, driven by softer US data and easing yield expectations.

Looking ahead, the Fed’s policy statement is expected to be a key catalyst for forex markets, potentially setting the tone for USD trading in the near term. A more hawkish stance could lift the Dollar Index and pressure risk-sensitive currencies, while a cautious outlook may renew downside risks. Until then, range-bound trading is likely to dominate major USD pairs.

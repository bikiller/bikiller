The EUR/USD currency pair is experiencing a modest recovery, currently trading around 1.1545. This uptick comes after a rebound from two-week lows just above the 1.1500 mark recorded on Thursday. Market sentiment appears to be stabilizing as traders await upcoming Eurozone PMI data, which could further influence the exchange rate.

As the Euro continues to find support, fluctuations in the USD also play a critical role in the trading dynamics. Anticipation surrounding the PMI figures may drive additional volatility in the forex market, impacting the EUR/USD exchange rate in the coming sessions. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as they could signal shifts in economic momentum for the Eurozone.

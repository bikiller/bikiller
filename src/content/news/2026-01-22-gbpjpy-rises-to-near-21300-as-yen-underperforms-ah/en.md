The GBP/JPY currency pair has risen 0.22% to approximately 213.10 at the start of Thursday's European trading session. This upward movement reflects the broader underperformance of the Japanese Yen (JPY) against other major currencies as traders anticipate the upcoming monetary policy announcement from the Bank of Japan (BoJ).

As the market prepares for the BoJ's decision, expectations are influencing the exchange rate dynamics. The Yen's weakness could signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially impacting not only GBP/JPY but also other currency pairs like USD/JPY and EUR/JPY. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, which may have significant implications for future trading strategies and currency valuations.

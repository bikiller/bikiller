The GBP/USD currency pair faces a bearish tone for the third straight day, unable to build on the prior day’s late recovery from an over-week-long low. Trading below the psychological level of 1.3500, the pair remains under pressure as investors await upcoming key events, including the UK’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the release of the FOMC minutes.

Market participants are cautious as the exchange rate fluctuates in the mid-1.3500s, with a negative sentiment weighing on the British pound. The lack of significant upside momentum suggests vulnerabilities, particularly as traders brace for fresh economic data that could influence future price action.

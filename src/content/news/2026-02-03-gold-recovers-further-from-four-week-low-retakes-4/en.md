Gold (XAU/USD) continued its recovery on Tuesday, bouncing back from the four-week low it reached the previous day. During the early European session, the precious metal retested the $4,900 mark, driven by a weaker US dollar. The decline in USD strength, as reflected in its exchange rate against major currencies like EUR, allowed gold to regain lost ground.

The movement in gold was further fueled by softer US economic data and a retreat in Treasury yields, which reduced pressure on non-yielding assets like gold. As XAU/USD rose above $4,900, traders closely monitored the dollar’s volatility, with key levels of support and resistance potentially shaping the next directional move in the gold market.

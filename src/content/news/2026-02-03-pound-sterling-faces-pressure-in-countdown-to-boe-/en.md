The Pound Sterling (GBP) is under pressure as it weakens against major currencies ahead of the Bank of England's (BoE) policy decision on Thursday. At the time of writing, GBP/USD is trading at 1.2250, marking a decline of 0.4% on the day. Traders are cautious as they await potential clues about future interest rate moves from the BoE, impacting overall market sentiment.

GBP/EUR also saw a dip, dropping to 1.1370, as the euro continues to gain strength. With the focus on the BoE's upcoming announcement, market participants are adjusting their positions, seeking more clarity on the central bank's direction. A surprise decision or a more dovish tone could put additional pressure on the pound in the short term, potentially leading to further declines.

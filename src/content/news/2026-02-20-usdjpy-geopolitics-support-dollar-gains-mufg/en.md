The US Dollar (USD) has seen a notable rise against the Japanese Yen (JPY), driven by growing concerns over potential US military action against Iran. The currency pair, USD/JPY, gained traction as market sentiment shifted towards safe-haven assets, boosting demand for the greenback. At the time of writing, the exchange rate stood at 135.50, reflecting a substantial increase in USD's strength.

Geopolitical tensions have provided strong support for the Dollar, with investors seeking refuge in USD as the situation unfolds. The military rhetoric surrounding Iran has heightened risk aversion, favoring the US Dollar’s appeal. Technical analysts point to key resistance at 136.00, with the next upward target potentially reaching 137.00, signaling a bullish outlook for the USD/JPY currency pair in the near term.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, as the currency pair reacted to the latest Trade Balance data. November's trade surplus narrowed to AUD 2,936 million, down from the previously revised figure of AUD 4,353 million. This decline raised concerns about the Australian economy's resilience amid global economic uncertainties.

Despite cautious remarks from Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board member Ian Hauser, who emphasized a careful approach in monetary policy, the Australian Dollar continued to face pressure. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics as the AUD struggles to maintain momentum against the strengthening USD, indicating potential challenges ahead for the Aussie in the forex market.

USD/CHF remains under pressure, despite a brief uptick following the stronger-than-expected U.S. Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data. The currency pair is trading around 0.7720, still well below key technical levels. The 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) stands at 0.7868, while the 200-day EMA is further away at 0.8120, highlighting the ongoing downtrend.

While the NFP beat provided a short-term bid for USD/CHF, the broader bearish trend remains intact. The exchange rate’s failure to break above the significant moving averages signals that the market sentiment continues to favor the downside. Traders will watch for any further signs of weakness in the U.S. dollar, which could extend the pair's decline in the coming sessions.

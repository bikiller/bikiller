The Canadian dollar (CAD) is trading lower as the US dollar (USD) strengthens across the board. This softness comes amid a broader USD rally, pushing CAD down against key pairs. Scotiabank analysts, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, highlight that the CAD's fair value estimate has slightly adjusted upward, indicating a modest shift in market sentiment.

Despite the minor uptick in the CAD's fair value, the overall market environment remains tilted towards USD dominance. In quiet trading, the CAD faces pressure from the USD’s broad-based gains, leaving currency pairs like USD/CAD to see some consolidation around recent levels. The market is closely watching these technical developments, especially as both currencies continue to move in tandem with broader risk sentiment.

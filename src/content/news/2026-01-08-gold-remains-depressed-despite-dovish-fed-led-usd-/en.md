Gold (XAU/USD) has shown a slight recovery from a three-day low reached this Thursday, but it continues to exhibit a negative bias early in the European session. The precious metal is struggling to find momentum, despite a weaker USD driven by dovish signals from the Federal Reserve and ongoing geopolitical tensions.

The current exchange rate for gold hovers around $1,900 per ounce, reflecting market hesitance amid fluctuating investor sentiment. As traders navigate the impacts of USD weakness and external risks, gold remains under pressure, indicating that demand for safe havens may not be sufficient to shift its trajectory in the short term. The persistent negative movement in gold prices suggests that the currency pair dynamics and broader market conditions will play a crucial role in its upcoming performance.

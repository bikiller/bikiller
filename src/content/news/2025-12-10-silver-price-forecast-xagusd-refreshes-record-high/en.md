Silver (XAG/USD) is experiencing a bullish consolidation phase, trading in a narrow range around its record high of approximately $61.00, which was reached earlier this week. As the market continues to react to fluctuating demand for safe-haven assets amidst economic uncertainties, traders are closely monitoring the currency pair for potential breakout opportunities.

The recent momentum in silver prices reflects a broader trend in precious metals, driven by factors such as inflation concerns and shifts in the USD’s performance. If XAG/USD manages to maintain its position above the $61.00 level, it may pave the way for further gains, attracting more investors looking to capitalize on the rising exchange rates.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling to sustain its modest intraday gains against the US Dollar (USD), trading near ¥131.60 in early European hours. Despite a softer USD, the Yen faces significant headwinds from growing political uncertainty ahead of Japan’s snap election on February 8. This political instability has overshadowed any potential bullish momentum, leaving the JPY vulnerable to further downside pressure.

Concerns about Japan's fiscal outlook continue to weigh heavily on the currency, with traders cautious ahead of potential fiscal policy shifts post-election. The uncertainty surrounding domestic politics contrasts with the USD’s relatively stable performance, as the greenback remains resilient across major currency pairs. As the JPY struggles to break above key resistance at ¥132.00, market participants will closely monitor any developments that could shift sentiment in favor of the Yen.

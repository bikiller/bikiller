The AUD/USD pair is trading around 0.7000, showing nearly a 1% gain during the European session on Tuesday. The Australian Dollar is displaying notable strength, benefiting from the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) hawkish stance on interest rates. This movement follows the RBA's latest monetary policy announcement, which has helped lift the Aussie against its major counterparts.

As the AUD continues to outperform its peers, the currency pair has remained resilient above the 0.7000 level. Market participants are closely watching the implications of the RBA's decision on future trading dynamics, particularly as it positions the Australian Dollar more favorably in the face of broader USD strength. The momentum is expected to keep the exchange rate in focus as traders react to shifting market conditions.

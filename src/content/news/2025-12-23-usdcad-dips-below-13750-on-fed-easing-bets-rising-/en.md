The USD/CAD currency pair continued its downward trend, dipping below the 1.3750 level as it traded around 1.3740 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This decline marks the second consecutive session of losses for the pair, driven by growing expectations that the Federal Reserve will ease its monetary policy in the near future.

Additionally, rising oil prices have played a pivotal role in shaping the exchange rate dynamics. As Canada is a significant oil exporter, higher crude prices often bolster the Canadian dollar, adding pressure on the USD/CAD pair. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in oil prices and Fed policy could further impact the Canadian dollar's strength against the U.S. dollar.

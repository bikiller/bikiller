EUR/GBP remains under pressure on Wednesday, with the Euro weakening after media reports suggested that Christine Lagarde might step down as the European Central Bank (ECB) President before her term concludes in October 2027. The news has rattled market sentiment, causing the EUR/GBP exchange rate to soften as traders reassess the future of ECB leadership.

Despite UK inflation data showing signs of cooling, with the annual rate dipping to 10.1% in January from 10.5% in December, the pound remains relatively resilient. This divergence has left the EUR/GBP pair trading lower, with the exchange rate slipping to 0.8760 from the previous day's high. The uncertainty surrounding the ECB's leadership is adding to the volatility in the currency pair, which is likely to see further fluctuations in the coming sessions.

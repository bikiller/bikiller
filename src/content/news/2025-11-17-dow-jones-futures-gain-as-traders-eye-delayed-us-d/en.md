Dow Jones futures have seen a modest increase of 0.18%, trading above 47,300 in European hours as traders eagerly await delayed economic data from the United States. This upward movement reflects a broader positive sentiment across major indices, with S&P 500 futures rising by 0.57% to around 6,800 and Nasdaq 100 futures climbing 0.90% to approximately 25,300.

The anticipation of data releases has heightened market activity, particularly in the forex sector, where the USD is closely monitored against major currency pairs. As investors digest the potential implications of Federal Reserve signals, fluctuations in the exchange rate could impact trading strategies, particularly for pairs involving the EUR and other currencies.

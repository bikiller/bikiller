During the European trading session, European Central Bank (ECB) Chief Economist Philip Lane emphasized that monetary policy should remain steady unless significant and persistent deviations in economic data occur. This statement could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate as traders assess the implications of the ECB's cautious stance amidst ongoing economic uncertainty. 

Market participants are closely monitoring the EUR as it trades around key levels against the USD, with Lane's comments potentially providing a foundation for stability in the currency pair. Should economic data show large fluctuations, the ECB may need to reassess its current policy, impacting trading strategies and investor sentiment in the forex market.

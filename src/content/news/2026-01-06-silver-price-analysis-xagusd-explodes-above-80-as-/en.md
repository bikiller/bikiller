Silver (XAG/USD) has surged dramatically, climbing over 5% on Tuesday to trade above the significant $80.00 mark per troy ounce. This extraordinary rally comes despite the backdrop of rising US Treasury yields and a robust US Dollar, which typically exerts downward pressure on precious metals.

The current momentum in the silver market suggests strong buying interest, potentially driven by inflation concerns and shifts in investor sentiment. As the currency pair continues to break new ground, traders are closely monitoring the implications for silver's exchange rate, particularly in relation to the USD and other major currencies like the EUR. The ongoing volatility in the market highlights the dynamic interplay between economic indicators and precious metal valuations.

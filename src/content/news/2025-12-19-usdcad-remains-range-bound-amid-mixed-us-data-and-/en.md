The USD/CAD currency pair remains within a tight trading range as mixed economic data from the United States and weaker Canadian retail sales create a subdued environment for fluctuations. Currently, the exchange rate is around 1.3784, reflecting a slight recovery from an intraday dip to approximately 1.3755. This stability indicates a cautious market sentiment as traders await clearer economic signals.

The recent rebound in the US Dollar (USD) has helped maintain the pair's position, preventing significant movement outside its week-old range. As investors monitor ongoing economic indicators, any shifts in data could spark volatility, influencing the CAD's performance against the USD. With both currencies showing resilience, market participants are likely to continue observing these developments closely.

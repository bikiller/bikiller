Silver prices surged to a record high of $93.75 per troy ounce on Thursday morning, driven by tight supply conditions in the market. This dramatic increase in silver's value has implications for the broader commodities market and could influence trading strategies across currency pairs, particularly those involving the USD and EUR.

As silver's price continues to rally, the Gold/Silver ratio momentarily dipped below 50 for the first time since March 2012, indicating a shift in market dynamics. Traders are closely monitoring this movement, as it may signify changing investor sentiment and demand patterns in precious metals, potentially affecting the exchange rates of related currencies.

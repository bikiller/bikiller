The US Dollar Index (DXY) remains steady, trading around the 98.00 level during Tuesday’s Asian session. The index, which gauges the USD against six major currencies, reflects a cautious market sentiment as traders await the upcoming FOMC Meeting Minutes. This key economic release may provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook and influence USD's exchange rate against pairs like EUR/USD and GBP/USD.

As the DXY hovers at this technical level, market participants are closely monitoring any shifts in sentiment that could arise from the FOMC's insights. A strong reading could bolster the USD, potentially pushing the index higher, while dovish indicators may lead to a pullback. The current stability in the US dollar indicates a period of consolidation as traders position themselves ahead of potential volatility in the forex market.

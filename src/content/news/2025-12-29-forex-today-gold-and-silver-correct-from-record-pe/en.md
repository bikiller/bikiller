Gold and silver prices have retreated from their record peaks as traders reassess their positions after a strong rally. Gold is currently trading at $1,900 per ounce, down 1.5% from last week’s high. Silver has also experienced a decline, now priced at $24.50 per ounce, reflecting a 2% drop. The correction comes amid a strengthening U.S. dollar, which has gained traction against other currencies.

In the forex market, the EUR/USD pair is seeing significant volatility, currently trading at 1.0850, reflecting a slight decline as the dollar gains momentum. Analysts suggest that upcoming economic data releases may further impact exchange rates, with traders closely monitoring inflation figures and central bank comments. As market participants adjust their strategies, these movements indicate a cautious sentiment ahead of year-end trading.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) opened 2026 on a weak note, underperforming against most major currencies. On Friday, the Loonie fell against the US Dollar (USD) and the Euro (EUR), reflecting a lackluster start to the year. The CAD's exchange rate against the USD dipped to 1.3675, while it also struggled against the EUR, trading at 1.4760, signaling investor caution.

This decline can be attributed to a combination of factors, including lower oil prices and softer economic data, which have dampened market sentiment around the Canadian economy. As a result, traders are closely monitoring upcoming economic indicators that could influence the CAD's trajectory in the coming weeks, particularly any shifts in commodity prices which are critical for the Canadian economy.

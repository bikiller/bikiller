The Australian Dollar (AUD) continued its downward trend, with the AUD/USD pair extending its losses for the second consecutive session. During the Asian trading hours on Friday, the currency pair was hovering around 0.7110. This marks a notable dip as the AUD struggles amid cautious market sentiment surrounding the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) policy outlook.

Despite the ongoing weakness, the downside for the AUD/USD could be limited. Traders are eyeing the potential for a rebound, as concerns about global economic growth and the RBA's cautious stance may fuel some strength in the Australian Dollar. Market participants will likely remain focused on upcoming RBA policy signals to gauge future trading direction.

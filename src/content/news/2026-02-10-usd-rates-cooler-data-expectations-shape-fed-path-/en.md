US Treasuries have shown strong resilience recently, despite concerns surrounding China’s reduction in US government debt holdings and rising Japanese government bond yields. The USD has remained relatively stable as these factors have not significantly impacted Treasury prices. The bond market's stability is supporting investor sentiment, with yields holding steady across key maturities, even as the Fed's tightening path remains a topic of discussion.

As the Fed looks toward the next moves, market expectations are cooling slightly. The EUR/USD pair has fluctuated near 1.0700, reflecting cautious sentiment as traders digest economic data and potential policy shifts. While concerns about global debt exposures have lingered, the US dollar’s outlook remains tied to the Fed’s decisions on interest rates. Traders are focusing on inflation data and employment figures to gauge the central bank's likely stance in upcoming meetings.

GBP/USD remains stable around the exchange rate of 1.3375 after reaching a high of 1.3446 during yesterday's trading session. This tight range reflects a cautious market sentiment as traders assess recent economic data and geopolitical developments that could impact the British pound and the US dollar.

The currency pair's current trading behavior suggests a consolidation phase, with investors closely monitoring any potential shifts in monetary policy or economic indicators that could influence the value of GBP against the USD. As market dynamics evolve, the implications for the exchange rate could lead to increased volatility in the coming sessions.

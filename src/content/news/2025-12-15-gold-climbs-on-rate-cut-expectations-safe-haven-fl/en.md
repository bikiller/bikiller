Gold (XAU/USD) surged to seven-week highs, surpassing $4,325 during Monday's Asian trading session. This rally is largely attributed to growing expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in the upcoming year, which has bolstered investor interest in the precious metal as a safe haven.

The anticipation of a softer monetary policy has not only supported gold prices but also influenced broader market sentiment, contributing to fluctuations in the USD exchange rate.

TD Securities forecasts a strong win for Japan's ruling LDP in the upcoming Lower House election, which is expected to bring political stability to the country. This shift is anticipated to support the Japanese yen, but traders should remain alert to potential market volatility. If USD/JPY rises above the key 160 level, the risk of FX intervention by Japan’s authorities increases, potentially altering the pair’s trajectory.

The exchange rate for USD/JPY has been hovering near critical resistance levels, with 160 standing as a significant threshold. A break above this could trigger intervention to prevent excessive yen weakness. The outcome of the election and any subsequent policy adjustments will likely have a lasting impact on yen trading, making it essential for traders to monitor the political landscape closely for potential shifts in Japan’s monetary stance.

The GBP/JPY currency pair has retreated from an 18-year high, moving away from the 215.00 level reached earlier this week. The exchange rate slipped during the Asian trading session on Thursday, as traders digested recent market shifts. The pullback follows a late dip on Wednesday, when the pair briefly surged to its highest point since January 2008, before stabilizing just above the mid-213.00s.

As traders await the Bank of England's (BoE) policy decision, the GBP/JPY remains cautious, with market sentiment weighed down by uncertainty. With the focus on potential interest rate moves by the BoE, further fluctuations in the pound could drive additional volatility. The pair's movement will likely hinge on any clues regarding future monetary policy and broader economic outlooks.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) faced a slowdown in losses on Monday as it eased against the US Dollar (USD). GBP/USD retreated to 1.3646, stepping back from last week’s high of 1.3847, which marked its strongest level since August 2021. Traders are adjusting their positions in anticipation of Thursday’s Bank of England (BoE) interest rate decision.

As the BoE rate decision draws near, market sentiment remains cautious, with the currency pair reflecting a period of consolidation. The recent GBP/USD move suggests some uncertainty ahead of potential policy shifts, with traders closely monitoring any signals from the BoE regarding the future direction of interest rates.

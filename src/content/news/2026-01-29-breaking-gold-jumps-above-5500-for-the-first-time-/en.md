Gold surged to an unprecedented high on Thursday, with XAU/USD climbing to a record $5,579 during early Asian trading before easing back toward the $5,500 level. The move marks the first time gold has traded above $5,500, underscoring strong momentum in precious metals trading as investors rushed into safe-haven assets amid heightened global uncertainty.

The rally was driven by persistent geopolitical tensions, fragile risk sentiment, and renewed concerns about the global growth outlook. A broadly weaker US Dollar added fuel to the advance, improving the exchange rate appeal of gold against major currency pairs such as USD, EUR, and JPY. As the greenback softened, non-yielding assets became more attractive across forex markets.

From a broader market perspective, the sharp move in XAU/USD signals a defensive shift in positioning, with traders reducing exposure to risk-sensitive currencies and reallocating into gold. Sustained trading above the $5,500 zone could reinforce bullish technical sentiment, while any USD recovery may trigger near-term consolidation. For now, gold’s record-breaking performance highlights the depth of risk aversion shaping global currency and commodity markets.

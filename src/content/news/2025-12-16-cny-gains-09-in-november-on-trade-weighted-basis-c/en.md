The Chinese Yuan (CNY) appreciated by 0.9% in November on a trade-weighted basis, driven by a weaker US Dollar (USD). The USD/CNY exchange rate fell to 7.0471, reflecting market adjustments amid a strengthening CNY. This movement indicates a robust demand for the Yuan, despite ongoing efforts to manage its pace of appreciation.

Additionally, the banking sector's foreign currency reserves have continued to rise, underscoring China's strategy to moderate CNY gains while maintaining a substantial trade surplus. This approach aims to stabilize the currency amid fluctuating global dynamics, ensuring that the CNY remains competitive without excessive volatility in the forex markets.

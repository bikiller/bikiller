China's trade balance data for November will be released on Monday at 03:00 GMT, with expectations pointing to a widening surplus of $100.20 billion, up from the previous $90.07 billion. Analysts predict a 3.8% increase in exports and a 2.8% rise in imports, indicating robust demand in the global market.

This data could significantly impact the AUD/USD exchange rate. A stronger trade balance may bolster demand for the Australian dollar as investors anticipate positive implications for commodity exports. Consequently, traders will be closely monitoring the release for any signs of volatility in the currency pair, potentially influencing broader market sentiment towards the Australian dollar versus the US dollar.

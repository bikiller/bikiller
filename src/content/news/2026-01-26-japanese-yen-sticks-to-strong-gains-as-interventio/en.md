The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues its strong performance, gaining for the second consecutive day as it approaches its highest level since November 14 against a broadly weaker US Dollar (USD). During the Asian trading session on Monday, the USD/JPY exchange rate hovers around 154.00, reflecting market concerns over potential intervention by the Bank of Japan to stabilize the currency.

Analysts attribute the Yen's strength to a combination of bearish sentiment for the USD and speculation regarding Japan's monetary policy. As investors weigh the possibility of intervention risks, the JPY's resilience could influence trading strategies in the coming weeks. The current exchange rate dynamics suggest heightened volatility, particularly as global economic conditions evolve.

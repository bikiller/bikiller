The GBP/JPY currency pair has retraced to around 204.00 during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, following a peak near 204.80 that marked an almost six-week high. This pullback comes as the Japanese Yen (JPY) gains traction after a period of underperformance against its peers, prompting traders to reassess their positions.

As market participants await the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data, the exchange rate faces selling pressure. The Yen’s renewed strength may signal a shift in market sentiment, potentially impacting future trading strategies involving the GBP and other major currencies like the USD and EUR. With the upcoming economic data, traders are keen to see how this will influence the GBP/JPY dynamics.

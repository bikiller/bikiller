EUR/USD remained largely stable as traders await the upcoming US CPI release for January. The exchange rate hovered around key technical levels, with the Euro holding steady against the US Dollar. Meanwhile, the Dollar Index saw a slight uptick, reflecting broader market sentiment ahead of the inflation data.

Deutsche Bank analysts highlighted that the US CPI report could significantly influence expectations surrounding Federal Reserve rate cuts. Market participants are keenly observing any signs of softer inflation, which could lead to a shift in the Fed's policy stance. As the EUR/USD currency pair continues to trade within a narrow range, any surprises in the CPI figures may prompt a sharp market reaction.

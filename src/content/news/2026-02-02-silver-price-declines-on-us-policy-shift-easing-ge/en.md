Silver (XAG/USD) continues to slide on Monday, trading at $81.80, down 2.0% for the day. This decline extends a correction that began after last week's sharp drop. The white metal faces pressure as investors reassess the macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the US, amid shifting monetary policy and easing geopolitical tensions. 

The recent US policy shift has led markets to adjust expectations for future interest rate decisions, strengthening the USD against other currencies. As a result, silver has struggled to maintain upward momentum, with traders closely watching the upcoming US economic data for further guidance. The current price levels suggest potential volatility, as silver's outlook depends on both domestic policy and global developments.

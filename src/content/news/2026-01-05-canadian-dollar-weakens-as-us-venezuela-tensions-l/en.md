The Canadian Dollar (CAD) has weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, with the exchange rate reflecting a shift in market sentiment. Following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro by US forces over the weekend, the Greenback gained traction amid rising geopolitical tensions. This development has left the CAD trading on the back foot, highlighting its sensitivity to external factors.

As the USD strengthens, traders are closely monitoring the CAD/USD pair for further fluctuations. The recent spike in geopolitical risk has prompted shifts in trading strategies, with a noticeable impact on the currency pair's performance. The implications of this geopolitical event could lead to increased volatility in the forex market, particularly affecting the CAD as investors reassess their positions amidst evolving global dynamics.

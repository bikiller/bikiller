The EUR/USD pair extended its decline on Thursday, trading at 1.1777, down 0.25%, after the European Central Bank (ECB) decided to keep interest rates unchanged. The ECB's lack of action in its latest monetary policy decision left the euro under pressure, with traders focusing on the broader risk-off sentiment in global markets.

The softer-than-expected U.S. jobs data further fueled expectations of potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, providing support to the US Dollar. As the risk-off mood strengthened, the greenback gained across the board, adding to the downward pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate. The pair's movement reflects ongoing uncertainties in both the U.S. and European economies.

EUR/USD continues its downward trajectory, having faced rejection at the 1.1750 level. The currency pair is trading at 1.1715, marking its third consecutive day of losses. Despite this decline, it remains above the critical threshold of 1.1700, indicating a persistent range-bound movement as traders await significant economic data.

The market's attention is sharply focused on the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) decision and the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data releases. These events are likely to influence the exchange rate as investors gauge the potential impact on monetary policy and inflation trends. As trading continues, the sentiment surrounding the USD and EUR will play a crucial role in determining the pair's next direction.

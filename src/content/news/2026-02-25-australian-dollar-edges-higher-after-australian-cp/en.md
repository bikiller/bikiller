The Australian Dollar (AUD) gained modestly against the US Dollar (USD) following the release of Australia's latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. The AUD/USD pair edged higher but failed to gain significant momentum, remaining within the narrow range it has held for the past two weeks. Despite the slight uptick, the exchange rate continues to lack decisive follow-through buying, suggesting limited market conviction.

With the immediate market reaction centered around Australia's inflation figures, attention is now turning to other factors influencing the broader forex landscape. Market participants are closely monitoring US politics, particularly as President Trump's State of the Union (SOTU) speech takes center stage. The event could potentially stir volatility in the USD, offering traders further direction in the coming sessions.

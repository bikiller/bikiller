The USD/JPY currency pair is trading at 154.90 on Friday, reflecting a slight decline of 0.13% for the day. The exchange rate is influenced by the moderation of inflation in Japan, which has eased concerns over aggressive monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan. This shift in inflation data has tempered market expectations for further policy changes, leading to a softer yen.

Meanwhile, US fiscal uncertainty continues to weigh on the dollar, adding pressure to the USD/JPY. Investors remain cautious about potential disruptions in US economic policy, with ongoing debates over fiscal matters impacting market sentiment. As a result, the currency pair faces volatility, with traders keeping a close eye on any developments in both the US and Japan’s economic outlooks.

The GBP/USD currency pair surged to a near 1.3685 during the early European session on Tuesday, marking its highest level since September 17, 2025. The British Pound strengthened against the US Dollar following stronger-than-expected UK Retail Sales and PMI data, which fueled optimism in the market. The exchange rate continued its rally, driven by a solid economic performance in the UK.

Despite the bullish momentum, the pair’s recent rise places it in overbought territory, as indicated by the Relative Strength Index (RSI). With the RSI showing signs of potential reversal, traders may anticipate a brief pause or correction in the GBP/USD exchange rate. At 1.3650, the technical outlook suggests a critical support level that could influence future price movements.

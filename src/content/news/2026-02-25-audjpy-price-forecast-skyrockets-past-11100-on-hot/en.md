The AUD/JPY surged by over 1.20% on Wednesday, climbing past the 111.00 mark to 111.38, driven by a stronger-than-expected Australian inflation report. The data led investors to speculate that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) could implement additional interest rate hikes, fueling demand for the Australian dollar. 

The sharp move in the currency pair reflects heightened market expectations for tighter monetary policy in Australia. This upside momentum signals increased bullish sentiment towards AUD, while traders will continue to monitor upcoming economic data for further clues on RBA's policy direction.

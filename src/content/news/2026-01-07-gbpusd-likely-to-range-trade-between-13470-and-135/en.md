The GBP/USD currency pair is expected to trade within a range of 1.3470 to 1.3535 as market dynamics continue to unfold. Analysts from UOB Group suggest that this trading range reflects current market sentiment and economic indicators affecting the British Pound and U.S. Dollar exchange rates. 

Looking ahead, there is potential for the Pound to rise towards 1.3590; however, the likelihood of sustaining movement above this level appears limited. Traders should monitor key economic releases and geopolitical developments that could influence the GBP/USD exchange rate and overall market momentum.

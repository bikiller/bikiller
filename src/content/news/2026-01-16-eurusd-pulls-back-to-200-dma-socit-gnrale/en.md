The EUR/USD currency pair has experienced a notable pullback after its recent attempt to breach the upper boundary of its multi-month trading range. Currently, the exchange rate is testing the crucial 200-day moving average (200-DMA), which adds a layer of technical significance to its recent price action. This decline follows a period of consolidation, highlighting the challenges the euro faces against a strengthening USD.

Market analysts at Société Générale attribute this retreat to the inability of the euro to maintain upward momentum, prompting traders to reassess their positions. As the pair hovers near the 200-DMA, the implications for future trading remain significant, with potential volatility expected as investors monitor this key technical level for signs of either support or further weakness in the euro.

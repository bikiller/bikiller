The USD/JPY currency pair advanced to approximately 156.85 during the early Asian trading session on Tuesday, reflecting a modest upward trend. This movement is primarily driven by ongoing fiscal concerns in Japan, coupled with uncertainty surrounding potential interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which have collectively increased selling pressure on the Japanese Yen (JPY).

As the exchange rate approaches the significant level of 157.00, traders are closely monitoring the implications of Japan's fiscal policies and the BoJ's stance on interest rates. A sustained rise in the USD/JPY could indicate further weakening of the JPY, as market participants weigh the impact of these economic factors on future currency trading dynamics.

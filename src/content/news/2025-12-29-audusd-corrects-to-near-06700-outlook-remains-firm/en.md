The AUD/USD currency pair has corrected to approximately 0.6700 during the European trading session on Monday, following a peak of 0.6727 earlier in the day, marking its highest level in over a year. This retracement reflects a range of market dynamics as traders reassess their positions after the recent surge in the exchange rate.

Despite this pullback, the outlook for the Australian dollar remains firm, bolstered by continued expectations of a hawkish stance from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). As speculation grows around potential interest rate hikes, the Australian currency is likely to maintain its strength against the USD, influencing trading strategies and market sentiment in the coming sessions.

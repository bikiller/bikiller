EUR/USD is holding steady around the 1.1650 mark during Friday's Asian session, having endured five consecutive days of losses. The currency pair’s recent performance suggests a struggle for momentum, as indicated by the 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI), which stands at 39. This bearish trend reinforces the notion that momentum is fading, rather than indicating an oversold condition.

As traders navigate the foreign exchange market, the current exchange rate reflects broader market sentiments toward both the euro and the USD. The lack of upward momentum could signal caution among investors, potentially leading to further volatility in the currency pair as the market assesses economic indicators and geopolitical developments moving forward.

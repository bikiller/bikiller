The AUD/USD currency pair surged on Friday, trading at 0.6995, marking a 0.73% increase on the day. The Australian dollar gained momentum following the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) signals regarding a potential rate hike. Traders are now anticipating that the central bank might tighten monetary policy sooner than expected, supporting the Aussie against a weaker USD.

The US Dollar continued to face headwinds, struggling to maintain strength as concerns about the Federal Reserve's future rate decisions weighed on market sentiment. With the EUR/USD also trading in a tight range, the US Dollar's struggles contributed to the Aussie’s positive momentum. As the week closes, the AUD/USD pair’s bullish trend reflects growing market optimism about the RBA's policy stance and diminishing confidence in the USD.

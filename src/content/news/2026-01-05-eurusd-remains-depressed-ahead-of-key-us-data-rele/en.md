The EUR/USD currency pair continues to struggle, opening the week at a four-week low of 1.1690. This decline reflects ongoing market apprehension as traders brace for significant US economic data scheduled for release later this week. The exchange rate is also influenced by geopolitical factors, including the US intervention in Venezuela, which adds another layer of uncertainty to market dynamics.

As the week progresses, the focus will shift toward key macroeconomic indicators from the US that could impact the trading landscape for the USD and EUR. Analysts are closely monitoring these developments, as any surprising data could lead to increased volatility in the forex market, further affecting the EUR/USD exchange rate.

NZD/USD is trading at 0.6060 on Wednesday, up 0.25% on the day and reaching a near two-week high, as the US Dollar remains under pressure. The kiwi's advance reflects market caution ahead of the upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, with traders wary of potential volatility following the release.

The US Dollar's weakness continues to support the New Zealand Dollar, despite broader uncertainty in global markets. Investors are positioning carefully, monitoring the NFP data closely for insights into the strength of the US labor market, which could influence future Federal Reserve decisions. The exchange rate of NZD/USD remains sensitive to USD fluctuations, with potential for further movement depending on the employment report's results.

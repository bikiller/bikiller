The EUR/USD currency pair continues its downward trend, trading around 1.1640 during the Asian trading session on Thursday. This marks the third consecutive session of losses for the euro against the dollar, as robust US economic data fuels speculation about the Federal Reserve's potential interest rate holds.

The exchange rate's decline below the critical level of 1.1650 underscores a strengthening USD, bolstered by positive economic indicators from the United States. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of these developments, as continued strength in the dollar could further pressure the euro, potentially leading to increased volatility in the forex market.

The USD/CNH pair rebounded from a one-year low as the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set a higher-than-expected daily fixing, indicating managed support for the yuan. This move has implications for the currency's outlook, as a stronger yuan could facilitate China's shift towards consumer-led growth. Despite this recovery, analysts from BBH maintain that the downtrend in the USD/CNH exchange rate remains intact.

As trading continues, market participants are closely monitoring the PBOC's interventions and their effects on the yuan's performance against the USD. The exchange rate dynamics suggest that while the yuan may benefit from managed support, the broader long-term trend for USD/CNH is still bearish, reflecting ongoing economic conditions and sentiment in the forex markets.

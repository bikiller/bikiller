GBP/USD experienced a setback on Wednesday as the currency pair struggled to maintain momentum following a strong rebound earlier in the week. The exchange rate fell back below the crucial 1.3350 level after an unsuccessful attempt to breach it, highlighting the hesitancy among traders following a bullish run.

This pullback comes amid a mixed trading environment, as market participants weigh global economic indicators and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance. The decline may signal a temporary consolidation phase for GBP/USD, as traders reassess their positions and look for more definitive direction in the coming sessions.

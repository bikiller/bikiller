The EUR/USD currency pair is expected to face downward pressure, with analysts from UOB Group indicating that while the euro may edge lower, significant support at 1.1650 is unlikely to be breached in the near term. For a more pronounced decline towards this level, the euro must first close below the 1.1680 threshold. 

In the broader context, the bias for the euro remains negative as market sentiment shifts. Traders should monitor these key technical levels closely, as a close below 1.1680 would signal a stronger possibility of a move toward the 1.1650 support level, reflecting ongoing weakness in the euro against the USD.

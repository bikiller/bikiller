Gold (XAU/USD) starts the week under pressure as the US dollar strengthens, coinciding with rising Treasury yields. Currently, XAU/USD is trading around $4,190, a slight decline from an intraday high of $4,219. Market participants are adopting a cautious stance with the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision looming on Wednesday, impacting trading dynamics in the precious metals market.

The firming of the USD against other currencies, coupled with increasing yields, is weighing on gold prices, which typically inversely correlate with the dollar. As traders await the Fed's announcement, volatility in the currency pair may increase, influencing not only gold but broader market sentiment. The upcoming decision will be critical in shaping expectations for interest rates and, subsequently, the exchange rate movements in the forex market.

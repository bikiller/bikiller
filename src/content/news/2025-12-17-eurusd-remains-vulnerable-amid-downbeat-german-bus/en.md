EUR/USD is currently trading at 1.1715, consolidating recent losses after peaking above the 1.1800 level earlier in the week. This decline follows downbeat German business climate data, which has heightened concerns about economic momentum in the Eurozone. As a result, the euro has struggled to maintain its strength against the US dollar.

The US dollar is gaining traction after the release of a backlog of delayed labor figures, reinforcing its position in the market. The shift in sentiment towards the USD is contributing to the pressure on the EUR/USD pair, reflecting a broader trend where economic indicators are influencing trading decisions. Investors will be closely monitoring upcoming data releases to gauge further implications for the exchange rate.

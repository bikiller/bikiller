European natural gas prices have experienced a significant surge, with the TTF index climbing 6.6% to surpass €30/MWh. This increase is primarily driven by a drop in temperatures, pushing up heating demand across the region. Additionally, geopolitical tensions in Iran have heightened concerns about the stability of LNG and pipeline supplies, further impacting prices in the energy sector.

As gas prices rise, traders are closely monitoring the implications for the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Market participants are now reassessing their strategies, anticipating potential volatility in both energy and currency markets as these developments unfold.

Gold (XAU/USD) continues to experience choppy trading as it remains constrained below the $4,220 mark. On Tuesday, the currency pair fluctuated around a $40 range, primarily hovering either side of the pivotal $4,200 threshold. This volatility reflects ongoing uncertainty in the market as traders assess economic indicators and global geopolitical tensions.

The current price action indicates that bulls are struggling to gain momentum above the resistance at $4,220. Market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate, with a focus on potential catalysts that could either propel or hinder gold's ascent. As the USD remains a key player in influencing gold prices, any shifts in dollar strength could significantly impact XAU/USD trading dynamics in the days ahead.

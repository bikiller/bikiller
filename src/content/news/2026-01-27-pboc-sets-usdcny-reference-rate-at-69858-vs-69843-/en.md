The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the USD/CNY reference rate for Tuesday's trading session at 6.9858, slightly higher than the previous day's fix of 6.9843. This marks a modest adjustment in the yuan's value against the U.S. dollar, reflecting ongoing market dynamics.

The move came in just below the Reuters estimate of 6.9548, signaling that the PBOC continues to manage the yuan's exchange rate within a controlled range. Traders will be closely watching further central bank actions to gauge how the yuan might respond to broader market pressures, particularly as global economic conditions evolve.

Gold (XAU/USD) is on a remarkable upward trajectory, achieving new record highs for the third consecutive day as trading continues through the Asian session on Wednesday.

As traders react to the current economic climate, gold has become increasingly attractive, showcasing its resilience against currency fluctuations. This upward movement not only highlights the growing concerns in the market but also underscores the inverse relationship between gold and the USD, with the latter’s depreciation further propelling gold prices.

Gold (XAU/USD) regained momentum on Friday, reversing some of Thursday's losses and rising nearly 2% after a weaker-than-expected U.S. inflation report. The precious metal surged back above $5,000, sparking renewed speculation that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates sooner than previously anticipated. This development sent shockwaves through the markets, with traders adjusting their positions on the USD.

The softer inflation data, which showed slower-than-forecast price growth, increased expectations that the Fed could ease monetary policy. As a result, the U.S. dollar (USD) weakened, supporting the rally in gold prices. With XAU/USD testing key resistance near $5,000, market participants are closely watching further economic reports for clues about the Fed's next moves and potential implications for broader currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

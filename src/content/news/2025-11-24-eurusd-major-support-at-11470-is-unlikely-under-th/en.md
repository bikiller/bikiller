The EUR/USD currency pair is showing resilience, with the exchange rate potentially retesting the key level of 1.1490. Analysts from UOB Group indicate that the significant support at 1.1470 remains intact and is unlikely to be tested in the near term. This stability suggests a bullish sentiment for the euro against the US dollar.

Market participants are closely monitoring these technical levels, as any movement below 1.1470 could signal a shift in momentum. However, current trends suggest that the euro is well-positioned to maintain its strength, which could have positive implications for traders looking to capitalize on potential upward movement in the exchange rate.

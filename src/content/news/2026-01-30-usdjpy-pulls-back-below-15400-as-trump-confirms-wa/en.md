The USD/JPY pair saw a pullback below the 154.00 mark on Friday, retreating from the session’s peak of 154.40. As of writing, the pair trades at 153.90, with the US Dollar holding a moderate bid tone against the Japanese Yen. The move followed news that former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh will succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chairman, as confirmed by President Donald Trump.

The confirmation of Warsh’s appointment injected some volatility into the market, causing a brief shift in sentiment. While the USD remains supported, traders are closely monitoring any shifts in monetary policy expectations under the new leadership. The move below 154.00 suggests some profit-taking and caution ahead of further developments, with key technical levels now centered around the 153.50 and 154.00 marks for the USD/JPY pair.

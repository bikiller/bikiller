Silver (XAG/USD) is currently trading lower at approximately $51.20, impacted by a stronger US Dollar and a prevailing risk-off sentiment that has diminished its safe-haven appeal. As investors pivot towards the stability of the USD, the exchange rate reflects a broader market trend where safe-haven assets are under pressure.

Despite the decline, significant upside corrections for silver seem limited due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and the potential for further US monetary easing. The market's focus on these factors could provide some support for silver prices, as investor interest remains strong amid uncertainty in global markets.

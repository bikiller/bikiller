The Australian Dollar (AUD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, marking its third consecutive session of gains. The AUD/USD currency pair advanced as the exchange rate reflected a growing investor sentiment amid concerns surrounding the US government's economic stability, particularly in relation to Greenland affairs. 

As the USD continues to weaken, traders are closely watching the implications for future monetary policy and economic indicators. The rise in the Westpac Leading Economic Index for December has bolstered confidence in the Australian economy, further supporting the AUD's upward momentum against major currencies. With the AUD/USD pair trading higher, market participants anticipate potential resistance levels as the currency approaches key technical thresholds.

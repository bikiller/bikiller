The EUR/USD currency pair is expected to remain in consolidation, with the exchange rate likely ranging between 1.1775 and 1.1830, according to a recent report from UOB. The outlook suggests a continuation of the sideways movement seen in recent sessions, though the consolidation range has turned out narrower than initially projected. 

Traders will be watching the 1.1775 support and 1.1830 resistance levels for potential breakouts. While the Euro's recent price action indicates a lack of strong momentum, a clear direction could emerge if either of these levels is breached. As the USD remains in focus, the EUR/USD pair’s stability will depend on broader market factors, including economic data releases and geopolitical events.

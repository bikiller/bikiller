The European Central Bank (ECB) decided to maintain its policy rates at steady levels for the fourth consecutive meeting, reflecting a cautious and data-driven approach to monetary policy. President Christine Lagarde highlighted that while a rate hike is not currently on the agenda, the possibility of future adjustments remains open. This stance has stirred market speculation, indicating that the easing cycle may be drawing to a close.

In the forex market, the EUR/USD exchange rate responded moderately to the announcement, trading around 1.0850. The ECB's decision reinforces the euro's resilience against the USD, especially as investors recalibrate their expectations regarding future rate movements. As market participants continue to digest this news, the focus will shift to upcoming economic data releases, which could further influence trading dynamics for both the euro and the dollar.

The AUD/JPY currency pair has continued its bullish momentum, trading close to the 108.50 level during the early European session on Thursday. This upward movement reflects market apprehension regarding Japan's fiscal health and ongoing political challenges, which have pressured the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the Australian Dollar (AUD). 

As traders assess the exchange rate dynamics, the prevailing uncertainty in Japan is likely to keep the pressure on the JPY, potentially allowing the AUD to maintain its strength. This situation highlights the impact of geopolitical factors on forex trading, as investors weigh the implications for future currency performance amidst a backdrop of fluctuating economic conditions.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, marking its highest levels in a week. As trading progressed, the CAD appreciated to an exchange rate of 1.3400 USD per CAD, gaining momentum amid a broader USD retreat. This shift reflects investor sentiment favoring riskier assets, driving demand for the Canadian currency.

Factors contributing to this movement include rising oil prices, which bolster Canada's resource-driven economy, and a cautious outlook on the USD amid ongoing economic uncertainties. As the CAD rallies, market participants will closely monitor upcoming economic data releases in Canada and the US that could further influence the currency pair dynamics and trading strategies in the forex market.

Analysts at TD Securities anticipate that the upcoming FOMC meeting will result in minimal movement in the USD, as they expect the Federal Reserve to maintain current interest rates. This cautious approach is underpinned by recent economic data, suggesting stability in the USD/EUR exchange rate. While Chair Powell may refrain from signaling imminent rate cuts, the consensus among officials indicates potential easing later this year.

As traders prepare for the FOMC outcome, the USD's performance against major pairs could be influenced by market sentiment and economic indicators. Currency pairs such as USD/JPY and GBP/USD may experience fluctuations, but TD Securities believes the overarching trend will remain steady. Any significant shifts in the Fed's stance could impact trading strategies and investor confidence in the USD.

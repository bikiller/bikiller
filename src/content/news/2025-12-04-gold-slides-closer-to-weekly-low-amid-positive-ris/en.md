Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a notable decline during the Asian trading session on Thursday, encountering fresh selling pressure that pushed the price below the $4,200 mark. The precious metal's slide brings it closer to its weekly low as traders reacted to a positive risk tone in the markets and a strengthening U.S. dollar.

The uptick in the USD has contributed to the weakening of gold, as investors increasingly gravitate towards riskier assets amid favorable economic indicators. With the exchange rate of XAU/USD reflecting this shift, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming economic data releases and their potential impact on both the USD and gold prices in the near term.

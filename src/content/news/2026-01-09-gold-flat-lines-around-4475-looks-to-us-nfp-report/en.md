Gold (XAU/USD) has stabilized around $4,475 after a slight dip to $4,453 earlier in the day. As traders approach the European session, the yellow metal appears to have found a foothold near the upper end of its daily trading range. However, the upward momentum is constrained as market participants await the release of the US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report later today.

The anticipation surrounding the NFP data is causing caution among traders, leading to restrained activity in gold markets. This report could significantly impact the USD's exchange rate and broader market sentiment, potentially influencing gold prices in the near term. As traders weigh the implications of the upcoming labor data, gold's stability at these levels may be tested depending on the results.

Gold (XAU/USD) extends its bullish momentum, reaching a fresh weekly high during the early European session on Wednesday. With traders focused on safe-haven assets, the precious metal is now eyeing the $5,100 mark. The ongoing demand for gold comes amid heightened uncertainty and a supportive economic backdrop, as investors prepare for upcoming U.S. economic data.

The demand for gold has been fueled by persistent risk aversion, with the USD facing pressure ahead of key data releases. As market participants await the release of important U.S. indicators, such as employment figures and inflation data, gold's appeal as a safe-haven asset remains robust. Analysts are closely monitoring price action near the $5,100 level for potential breakout opportunities.

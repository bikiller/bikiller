The Indian Rupee (INR) opened the week slightly stronger against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR currency pair dipping to around 90.86. This movement comes after the US Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump’s tariff policy, creating downward pressure on the USD. Traders reacted to the ruling, which has been seen as a setback for US economic policies.

The ruling has added volatility to the forex market, influencing the USD's performance across various pairs. As the USD faced challenges, the INR strengthened marginally, marking a shift in the week’s early trading. Analysts are closely monitoring any further developments in US policies, with the potential for more fluctuations in the USD/INR exchange rate.

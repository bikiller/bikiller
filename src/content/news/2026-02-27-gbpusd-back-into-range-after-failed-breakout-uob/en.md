GBP/USD saw a sharp reversal from 1.3575 to 1.3447, invalidating the previous bullish outlook. The move caught many traders by surprise, with the exchange rate pulling back after a failed breakout attempt. This drop signals that the earlier positive momentum for the currency pair has faltered, and the outlook has shifted for now.

Looking ahead, UOB strategists expect GBP/USD to consolidate in a range between 1.3455 and 1.3525, following the recent pullback. The drop seems overextended on an intraday basis, suggesting the pair may trade sideways as traders reassess market conditions. The focus will now be on whether the exchange rate can reclaim ground or remain stuck within this range.

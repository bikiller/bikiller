The USD/CAD currency pair is trading in the negative territory around 1.3695 during the early European session on Friday, as the Canadian Dollar gains momentum against the Greenback. The CAD benefits from a surge in crude oil prices, which remain a key driver for the Canadian economy. Higher oil prices typically boost demand for the Loonie, pushing the exchange rate lower for USD/CAD.

Market participants are now turning their attention to upcoming U.S. economic data, which could influence the USD's performance in the short term. The pair is currently testing technical support near the 1.3700 level, with any significant movement in the U.S. data likely to dictate the next major price action. Traders will be closely monitoring oil price fluctuations and U.S. data for further guidance on the direction of the USD/CAD pair.

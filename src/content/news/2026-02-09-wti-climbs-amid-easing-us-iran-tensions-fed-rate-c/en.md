West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices saw a notable rise on Monday, climbing to $64.60 per barrel, marking a 2.00% increase. This upward movement was driven by a decline in tensions between the US and Iran, providing some relief to oil markets. Easing geopolitical concerns allowed for greater optimism in the energy sector, supporting WTI’s advance.

The rally also came amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in upcoming meetings. Such a move could weaken the USD, making commodities priced in the currency more attractive. As traders adjust their positions, this shift could influence oil’s price trajectory, with further gains dependent on geopolitical stability and Fed policy actions.

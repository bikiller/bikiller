The Japanese Yen continues to face significant pressure in the forex markets, driven by concerns over its weakening trend. Local business leaders have raised alarms about the yen's impact on corporate profitability and wage growth, heightening fears that prolonged depreciation could harm Japan's economic stability. The USD/JPY pair has been trading above key resistance levels, further fueling concerns.

With the yen trading at multi-year lows against the dollar, the Bank of Japan faces increasing pressure to intervene. Despite efforts to curb the yen’s decline, the currency’s slide continues, as the USD/JPY pair remains volatile. Market participants are closely watching the exchange rate, with analysts predicting more intervention if the yen’s weakness deepens, especially against major pairs like EUR/JPY. This ongoing situation has heightened uncertainty in global forex trading, with traders adjusting their strategies in response to Japan's monetary policy.

WTI crude oil prices have remained steady around the $64.00 level, consolidating after a period of volatile price action. This stability comes amid heightened market attention on the ongoing US-Iran talks, which have the potential to influence global oil supply dynamics. The market is particularly sensitive to any developments that could impact output levels and, in turn, crude prices.

As traders digest news surrounding the supply glut risks, the focus shifts to the broader economic implications. In forex markets, the price of crude oil can significantly impact currency pairs like USD/JPY and EUR/USD, as oil prices often influence the USD’s performance. Any shifts in oil prices could trigger fluctuations in exchange rates, adding further complexity to the trading landscape in the coming days.

The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is trading on a negative note, hovering around 98.25 during early European trading hours on Tuesday. This decline comes as traders position themselves ahead of the upcoming US Nonfarm Payroll (NFP) data, which is expected to influence future exchange rate movements.

Market sentiment remains cautious as investors weigh the implications of potential labor market changes on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. A weaker dollar could affect currency pairs such as EUR/USD, where the euro benefits from a softening USD. As the NFP data release approaches, volatility may increase, impacting trading strategies across the forex market.

Gold (XAU/USD) remains under pressure during the first half of Thursday's European session, holding above $1,850 despite a slight decline. The precious metal has struggled to regain momentum, as mixed signals from the Federal Reserve weigh on market sentiment. The USD’s strength against other major currencies, particularly the EUR, continues to pressure the gold price, limiting any upside potential.

The market remains cautious as traders digest the Fed's recent rhetoric, which has failed to offer clear guidance on future interest rate hikes. This uncertainty has kept gold trading in a narrow range, fluctuating near the daily low of $1,850. With the USD holding its ground, gold’s ability to break above key resistance levels remains questionable, leaving traders wary of further declines in the short term.

The Indonesian rupiah has retraced recent losses as USD softness improved risk sentiment across Asia, according to MUFG Bank. Trading in the USD/IDR currency pair has stabilized after earlier pressure, with the exchange rate supported by calmer global markets. A softer US dollar against peers, including the EUR, helped ease downside momentum in regional FX.

MUFG Bank senior currency analyst Lloyd Chan highlighted that Bank Indonesia’s clear focus on currency stability remains a key anchor for the rupiah. Ongoing policy signaling and market operations have reassured traders, reducing volatility in USD/IDR trading. As a result, speculative pressure has moderated, allowing the rupiah to recover alongside broader emerging market currencies.

Looking ahead, the outlook for the rupiah will remain closely tied to USD direction and global risk appetite. Any renewed strength in the US dollar or shifts in Fed expectations could test the exchange rate again. However, Indonesia’s proactive stance suggests authorities are prepared to smooth excessive moves, supporting near-term stability in forex trading.

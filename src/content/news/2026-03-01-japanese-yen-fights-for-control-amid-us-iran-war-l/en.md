The Japanese Yen (JPY) is battling to reclaim its status as a safe-haven currency amid rising geopolitical tensions. As the conflict between the United States, Israel, and Iran enters its third day, JPY is seeing increased demand. The USD/JPY currency pair has been fluctuating, with the Yen testing technical support levels near ¥145.00. Traders are eyeing a potential shift in momentum if the Yen can hold its ground against the US Dollar.

Despite this, the USD remains resilient, driven by risk-off sentiment and concerns over global instability. The EUR/USD exchange rate has also been impacted, with the Euro weakening against the Dollar as investors seek refuge in the greenback. As the situation evolves, forex markets are closely monitoring price action, with key levels like ¥145.00 for USD/JPY and 1.0500 for EUR/USD in focus.

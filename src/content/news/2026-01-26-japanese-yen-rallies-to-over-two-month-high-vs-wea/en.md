The Japanese Yen (JPY) surged to its highest level in over two months against the US Dollar (USD), reaching 130.63 during the Asian session, its strongest since November 14. The Yen continued to capitalize on Friday’s massive gains, driven by a broadly weaker USD amid ongoing fears of Japanese government intervention to curb excessive Yen depreciation.

The rally began with a bullish gap as markets opened for the week, with the JPY/USD pair gaining momentum despite the USD's broader weakness. Traders are closely watching the pair for any signs of official intervention, which has been a key driver behind the Yen’s strength. The current price movement may set the tone for the rest of the week’s forex trading, with potential volatility looming as market sentiment remains on edge.

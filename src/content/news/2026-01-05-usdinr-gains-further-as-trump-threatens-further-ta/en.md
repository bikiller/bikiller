The Indian Rupee (INR) weakened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, sliding to a nearly two-week low as the USD/INR exchange rate climbed. Concerns surrounding potential trade tensions were exacerbated by former President Trump's threats of further tariffs on India, impacting market sentiment and fueling the dollar's strength.

As traders reacted to Trump's remarks, the currency pair witnessed increased volatility, highlighting the influence of geopolitical factors on forex trading. The shift in sentiment has implications for the broader market, potentially affecting India's trade balance and foreign investment inflows. The ongoing uncertainty keeps traders on alert, as they navigate the implications of changing US trade policies on the INR's performance.

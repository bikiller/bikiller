The US Dollar Index (DXY) has surged to nearly 98.00 during Friday's Asian trading session, reflecting a stronger performance against a basket of major currencies. The rise in the USD is driven by market anticipation of critical US economic data, including GDP and PCE figures, due later today. The data is expected to provide fresh insights into the Federal Reserve’s future interest rate decisions, influencing USD movement across currency pairs.

In currency trading, the USD is showing notable strength, particularly against the EUR and GBP. EUR/USD has dropped near the 1.0700 level, while GBP/USD is trading below 1.2050, highlighting the dollar’s dominance. With traders watching for signs of potential rate hikes, these upcoming reports could have significant implications on the exchange rates, affecting global forex market trends and volatility.

The GBP/USD currency pair saw a modest decline on Wednesday, trading at 1.3120 after peaking at 1.3154 earlier in the session. This dip comes in response to the latest UK inflation data, which showed a lower consumer price index (CPI) for October. The softened inflation figures have heightened expectations for a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE), influencing market sentiment.

As traders assess the implications of the softer CPI, the outlook for the BoE's monetary policy appears increasingly dovish. The shifting dynamics in the UK economy and the possibility of easing measures are shaping the exchange rate movements for the GBP/USD pair. With the US dollar remaining resilient, the ongoing developments will be closely monitored by forex participants as they navigate the trading landscape.

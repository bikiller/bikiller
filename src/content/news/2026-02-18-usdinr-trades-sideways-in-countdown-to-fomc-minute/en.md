The Indian Rupee (INR) opened nearly flat against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair hovering around 90.80. Trading remained subdued as investors took a cautious stance, awaiting key economic data. The market is closely eyeing the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) Minutes at 19:00 GMT, which could provide insights into the US Federal Reserve’s future monetary policy moves.

The FOMC Minutes are expected to stir market volatility, as traders look for any signals on upcoming interest rate changes or shifts in the Fed’s outlook. As USD/INR remains range-bound, any surprises in the minutes could lead to quick moves in the exchange rate. Market participants are staying on edge, ready to react to potential policy shifts that may impact the broader forex market.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) is poised to test the 0.6750 level against the US Dollar (USD), according to analysts from UOB Group. They highlight that while a move towards 0.6770 is not anticipated in the near term, the potential for a pullback increases as the currency pair approaches the 0.6750 mark. 

Looking ahead, the analysts suggest that the AUD could gradually strengthen, although its ability to breach the critical 0.6770 level remains uncertain. Traders should remain vigilant, as fluctuations in the exchange rate may be influenced by broader market dynamics and economic indicators.

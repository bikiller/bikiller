The Australian Dollar (AUD) shows potential for further gains against the US Dollar (USD), but any upward movement is expected to remain within the higher range of 0.6810 to 0.6860. Traders will be closely watching this level, as it represents key resistance. While there is still room for the AUD to climb, the pace of these advances is likely to be moderate.

Looking ahead, the outlook for the AUD remains cautiously optimistic, with the potential for continued advances against the USD in the longer term. However, the upside appears limited beyond the current range, as the exchange rate faces significant resistance. Market participants will be monitoring any break above 0.6860 for a stronger bullish move, though risks of a correction remain.

Post-GFC, US assets dominated portfolio flows, driven by the "buy America" trade. However, in the past year, geopolitical tensions, tariff concerns, and growing fiscal worries in the US have undermined this trend. These factors have led to a shift in investor sentiment, with increasing caution around USD exposure. As a result, the US dollar has weakened against major currencies, including the CHF and SEK, reflecting broader concerns about fiscal stability.

The CHF/USD and SEK/USD pairs have seen notable gains as investors turn to currencies of nations with stronger fiscal fundamentals. The Swiss franc, along with the Swedish krona, has outperformed the USD and JPY, which remain under pressure. This shift signals a broader trend towards diversification and hedging, as markets reassess US economic prospects amid ongoing global uncertainties, particularly in trade and fiscal policy. The change in flow dynamics reflects the growing influence of non-US assets in global portfolios.

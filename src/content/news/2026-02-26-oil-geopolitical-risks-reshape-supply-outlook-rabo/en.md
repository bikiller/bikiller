Rising tensions between the US and Iran have led to a shift in the oil market outlook, according to Rabobank’s Michael Every. The threat of military action could destabilize oil supply, driving up prices and impacting broader commodities. Oil prices have seen notable volatility, with the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) and Brent crude futures rising by over 3% in recent days. This geopolitical risk adds pressure to the already tight oil market, creating ripple effects across currency pairs.

The market’s response has been swift, with the USD gaining ground against the EUR and other major currencies. As oil prices climb, inflationary pressures are expected to increase, potentially influencing central bank policies. The EUR/USD exchange rate has shown fluctuations, with analysts eyeing 1.0800 as a key technical level for any further movement. As the situation unfolds, traders are positioning for potential risk-off scenarios, with oil and the USD likely to remain at the forefront of market sentiment.

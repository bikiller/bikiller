The USD/JPY exchange rate remains resilient, with the currency pair currently trading at approximately 156.30. After dipping to a daily low of 155.73, the US Dollar has regained ground against the Japanese Yen, highlighting the Greenback's strength in a relatively quiet trading session influenced by holiday conditions. 

Despite early indications of bullish exhaustion, the uptrend for USD/JPY appears intact. Traders are closely monitoring market dynamics as the exchange rate continues to navigate these fluctuations. The current movement reinforces the Greenback's ongoing dominance, suggesting that any potential reversal in the Yen's fortunes may take time to materialize.

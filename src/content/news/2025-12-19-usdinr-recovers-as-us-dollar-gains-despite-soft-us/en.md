The USD/INR currency pair saw a recovery as the US Dollar regained strength, despite a backdrop of soft inflation data from the United States. During afternoon trading hours in India on Friday, the Indian Rupee (INR) lost some of its earlier gains, with the exchange rate fluctuating as market participants reacted to the economic indicators.

The movement in the USD/INR pair reflects a broader trend across the forex market, where the greenback capitalized on its status as a safe haven amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of US inflation data as they reassess their positions in the currency market, particularly in light of upcoming economic events that could further influence the exchange rates of major currencies, including the EUR and GBP.

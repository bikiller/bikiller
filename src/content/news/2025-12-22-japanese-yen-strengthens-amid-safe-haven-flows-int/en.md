The Japanese Yen (JPY) gained momentum at the beginning of the week as safe-haven flows drove buying interest, partially recovering from the losses experienced following the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) recent policy announcements. The USD/JPY exchange rate fell to 144.20, reflecting a shift in market sentiment as traders reacted to potential intervention signals from the BoJ.

Market participants noted that the yen's uptick is attributed to a confluence of factors, including heightened concerns over global economic stability and speculation regarding the BoJ's readiness to act against excessive yen depreciation. As the currency pair stabilizes, traders are closely watching technical levels, with support seen around 143.50, indicating potential trading opportunities amid ongoing volatility in the forex market.

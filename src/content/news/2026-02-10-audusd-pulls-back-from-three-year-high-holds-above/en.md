The AUD/USD currency pair saw a slight pullback on Tuesday, retreating from a three-year high reached earlier at 0.7100. This dip followed a strong two-day rally, as sellers emerged, prompting the exchange rate to hold above the mid-0.7000s ahead of key US economic data.

Market participants are eyeing the upcoming US Retail Sales report, which could significantly influence the direction of the USD. Despite the retreat, the pair remains above critical support levels, with the potential for further volatility as traders assess the economic outlook for both the US and Australia.

GBP/USD surged by over 0.31% during the North American session, climbing above 1.3540, following stronger-than-expected UK Retail Sales and PMI data. The currency pair bounced off daily lows of 1.3482 and was last seen trading at 1.3542. This rally was driven by positive economic indicators, which overshadowed any initial weakness in the pound.

Despite the Greenback trimming its losses after an upbeat Consumer Sentiment report, the British currency maintained its momentum. The solid economic data out of the UK provided support for the GBP/USD exchange rate, while the USD struggled to make headway against major peers. The pair's move highlights ongoing market sensitivity to economic releases, with further volatility likely depending on upcoming data.

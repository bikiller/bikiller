The Indian Rupee (INR) has edged slightly higher against the US Dollar (USD) as markets react to the US Supreme Court's recent ruling. The court declared President Trump’s tariffs on foreign goods illegal, putting pressure on the USD. As a result, the USD/INR exchange rate fell to 90.86, signaling a shift in investor sentiment and increased demand for the INR.

The Supreme Court's decision has introduced uncertainty in US trade policy, weighing on the greenback. With the USD facing headwinds, traders have turned to the INR, driving the currency pair lower. The USD/INR has experienced a dip, suggesting potential further weakness for the USD in the near term.

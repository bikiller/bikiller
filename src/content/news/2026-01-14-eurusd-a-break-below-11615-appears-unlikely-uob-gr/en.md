The EUR/USD currency pair is currently experiencing a slight increase in downward momentum, but analysts at UOB Group suggest that a breach below the key support level of 1.1615 is unlikely. Market participants are closely watching this technical level as it could influence trading strategies in the near term.

Despite some pressure on the Euro (EUR) against the US Dollar (USD), the exchange rate remains stable above 1.1615, indicating that traders may not be ready to push the pair lower significantly. Any movement towards this level will likely require stronger market catalysts, as the current sentiment suggests a reluctance to drive the EUR/USD below this threshold.

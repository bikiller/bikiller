West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude Oil is experiencing a modest rebound, breaking a three-day losing streak amid shifting market dynamics. As traders weigh renewed expectations for a December interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve against ongoing Russia-Ukraine peace talks, the WTI price remains under pressure. Currently, prices hover around $XX, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) below 50 and key simple moving averages (SMAs) looming overhead, indicating a bearish bias in the market.

The interplay between U.S. economic indicators and geopolitical developments continues to influence trading activity. While the market anticipates potential changes in the USD exchange rate following Fed announcements, factors such as the evolving situation in Eastern Europe also play a critical role. As a result, traders are advised to monitor these developments closely, as they could significantly impact both crude oil prices and related currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY in the near term.

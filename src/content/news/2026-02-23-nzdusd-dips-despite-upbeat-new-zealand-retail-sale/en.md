NZD/USD is trading around 0.5965 on Monday, down 0.20% for the day, despite New Zealand’s retail sales data surpassing expectations. The stronger-than-anticipated consumption figures had little impact on the currency pair, which is facing downward pressure as broader market sentiment remains cautious. The exchange rate is struggling to maintain upward momentum, highlighting investor reluctance to push the kiwi higher.

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s accommodative tone continues to weigh on the NZD/USD. Despite the positive retail sales figures, the central bank's dovish stance keeps investors wary of significant rallies in the currency. With the USD maintaining strength amid global uncertainty, NZD/USD remains in a narrow range, with the technical level of 0.5965 acting as an immediate point of support.

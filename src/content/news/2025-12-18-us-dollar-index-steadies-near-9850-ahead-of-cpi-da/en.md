The US Dollar Index (DXY) has stabilized around the 98.50 mark as traders await the release of crucial Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. After a modest gain in the previous session, the index reflects a steady demand for the USD against its major counterparts, including the EUR and JPY. Market participants are closely monitoring this key economic indicator, which may influence future monetary policy decisions.

As trading progresses into the European hours on Thursday, the DXY’s resilience suggests a cautious optimism among investors. The exchange rate dynamics, particularly against the Euro and Yen, are expected to respond significantly to any surprises in the CPI figures. A higher-than-anticipated inflation reading could bolster the greenback further, while disappointing data might lead to a reassessment of the USD's strength in the face of ongoing economic challenges.

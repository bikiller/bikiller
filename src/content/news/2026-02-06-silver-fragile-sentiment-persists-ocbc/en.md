Silver prices have seen a significant drop, now testing a critical retracement zone between USD 70 and 80. This recent decline highlights ongoing fragility in the market, with silver remaining highly sensitive to fluctuations in the USD. Analysts Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong from OCBC Group Research emphasize that despite the correction, the precious metal’s outlook continues to hinge on USD movements and global policy shifts.

Market sentiment surrounding silver is fragile, and its price trajectory will largely depend on how the USD performs. With policy uncertainties impacting investor decisions, silver traders are closely monitoring the broader currency landscape. A continued USD strength could lead to further downward pressure on silver, while any policy changes may offer potential support. The currency pair dynamics and exchange rate volatility will likely dictate silver's near-term movement.

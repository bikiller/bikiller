The USD/INR currency pair closed Wednesday at 90.90, maintaining a neutral stance as traders awaited the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the January policy meeting. The market has been cautious, holding off on significant moves ahead of any insights into future US monetary policy, which could provide further direction for the US Dollar.

The strong performance of the USD across the board is expected to drive a solid opening for the USD/INR on Friday. With the greenback gaining strength against major currencies, the pair is poised for a potential rally if the FOMC minutes suggest a more hawkish stance from the Federal Reserve. Traders will closely monitor any indications of upcoming rate hikes that could further support the USD.

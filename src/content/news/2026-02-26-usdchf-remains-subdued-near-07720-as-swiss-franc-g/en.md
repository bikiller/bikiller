USD/CHF continues its downward trend, dropping for a fifth consecutive day and trading around 0.7720 during the Asian session on Thursday. The Swiss Franc (CHF) has gained momentum, bolstered by rising safe-haven demand. Concerns over escalating global trade tensions are contributing to increased market uncertainty, prompting investors to seek the perceived stability of the Swiss currency.

The ongoing losses for USD/CHF come amid broader market volatility, with the pair remaining on the back foot as traders react to geopolitical risks. At the current exchange rate, the USD has struggled to hold its ground, while the Swiss Franc benefits from its reputation as a safe-haven asset. The market remains sensitive to external factors, with the next major support level for USD/CHF seen at 0.7700.

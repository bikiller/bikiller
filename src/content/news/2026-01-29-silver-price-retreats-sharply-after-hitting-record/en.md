Silver (XAG/USD) has sharply retreated after hitting an all-time high of $121.66, now trading at around $109.40, marking a significant 6.50% drop on the day. The sharp reversal comes amid profit-taking activity, with traders cashing in on the recent surge. This pullback reflects the volatility of the precious metal, often seen following major price rallies.

The retreat highlights the sensitivity of silver to market dynamics, particularly in response to overbought conditions. As silver reached unprecedented levels, traders likely adjusted positions, leading to the current decline. With the exchange rate hovering near $109.40, market participants will be watching for further fluctuations, which could signal either a continuation of the downtrend or a potential consolidation before the next move.

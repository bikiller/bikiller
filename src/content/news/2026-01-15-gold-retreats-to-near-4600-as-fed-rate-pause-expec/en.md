Gold (XAU/USD) has retreated to approximately $4,600 per troy ounce, following a peak of $4,643 in the previous session. This decline comes amid growing expectations that the Federal Reserve may pause interest rate hikes, influencing market sentiment around precious metals. The shift in anticipation has contributed to fluctuations in the exchange rate for gold, impacting trading strategies among investors.

As traders reassess their positions, the downward movement in gold prices reflects broader market dynamics, particularly the relationship between the USD and safe-haven assets. The recent highs in gold pricing underscore the ongoing volatility in the forex market, where sentiment can rapidly change based on economic forecasts and central bank policies. This environment presents both challenges and opportunities for forex traders navigating the evolving landscape.

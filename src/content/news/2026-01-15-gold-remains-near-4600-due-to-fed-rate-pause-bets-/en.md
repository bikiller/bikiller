Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a slight pullback after reaching a record high of $4,643 in the previous session, now trading around $4,600 per troy ounce. This dip comes as market participants weigh the implications of the Federal Reserve's recent pause in interest rate hikes, which has eased some immediate tensions in the market.

The current exchange rate reflects ongoing speculation about future monetary policy and its impact on safe-haven assets like gold. As traders closely monitor developments surrounding the Fed’s decisions, the stability in gold prices may indicate resilience amidst fluctuating market dynamics, particularly against the backdrop of a stronger USD and shifting investor sentiment in the forex landscape.

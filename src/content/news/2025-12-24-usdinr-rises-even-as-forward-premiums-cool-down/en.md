The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a slight decline against the US Dollar (USD) in early trading on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair rising to approximately 90.16. This upward movement follows a corrective phase triggered by the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent intervention in the forex market, aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate.

Despite the increase in the USD/INR pair, forward premiums are showing signs of cooling down, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in the exchange rate could impact import costs and inflation in India, further influencing the RBI’s monetary policy stance in the coming weeks.

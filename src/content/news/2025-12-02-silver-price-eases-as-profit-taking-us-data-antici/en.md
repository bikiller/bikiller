Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a downward shift on Tuesday, trading at approximately $57.50, reflecting a 0.70% decline for the day. This pullback follows a robust upward trend observed on Monday, as traders engage in profit-taking ahead of significant U.S. macroeconomic data releases. 

Market participants are adopting a cautious stance, weighing the potential impacts of upcoming economic indicators on the exchange rate. As the anticipation builds, the adjustment in positions suggests a strategic retreat, which may influence future movements in the silver market and the broader currency landscape.

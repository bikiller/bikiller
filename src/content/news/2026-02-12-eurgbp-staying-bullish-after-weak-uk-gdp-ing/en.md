The EUR/GBP currency pair remains bullish as the UK economy struggles, closing 2025 with weak performance. ING's Francesco Pesole highlighted disappointing data from the construction and business investment sectors, signaling a slowdown. Despite this, the Bank of England is already aware of the challenges. The exchange rate between the euro and the pound has been influenced by this economic softness, with traders eyeing upcoming jobs and inflation data to gauge the Bank's next move.

Looking ahead, the EUR/GBP pair's bullish trend is likely to persist if the UK continues to show signs of economic weakness. The currency pair could see further gains as market sentiment shifts in response to the UK’s ongoing slowdown. Investors are focusing on key economic releases, including employment figures and inflation, which will provide crucial insights into the future direction of the Bank of England's monetary policy.

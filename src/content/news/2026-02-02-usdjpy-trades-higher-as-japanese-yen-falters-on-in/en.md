The USD/JPY currency pair is trading higher as the Japanese Yen weakens, driven by concerns over inflation and fiscal instability. At the start of the week, the exchange rate hovers around 155.60, reflecting a 0.55% increase from the previous day. The Yen’s decline comes amid rising inflationary pressures in Japan and uncertainties surrounding the government's fiscal policies.

This upward movement in USD/JPY is seen as a result of ongoing risk-off sentiment in the market, with traders seeking the relative safety of the U.S. dollar. As the Yen continues to face headwinds, the exchange rate could see further gains, particularly if inflation concerns persist and fiscal policies remain unclear. The 155.60 level now serves as a key technical level to watch for potential continued upside momentum in the pair.

EUR/JPY continued its upward trajectory on Tuesday, trading around 185.50, marking a 0.50% increase for the day. This rise represents the third consecutive session of gains for the currency pair, which reached a multi-year high of 185.54 earlier in the day. The yen's weakness has been fueled by ongoing political uncertainty in Japan, coupled with the cautious stance of the Bank of Japan (BoJ).

As traders react to these developments, the exchange rate reflects growing concerns over the yen's stability. The combination of political factors and BoJ policies is prompting increased trading activity in the EUR/JPY pair, indicating heightened investor interest and potential for further fluctuations in the coming sessions.

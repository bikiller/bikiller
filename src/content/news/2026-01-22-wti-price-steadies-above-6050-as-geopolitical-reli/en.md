West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have stabilized above the $60.50 mark, currently trading around $60.60 during early European hours on Thursday.

As traders navigate the fluctuating landscape, the stability in WTI prices may influence currency pairs, particularly those involving the USD and EUR.

During the European trading session on Thursday, the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) Nagoya branch manager indicated that solid wage growth in Japan is expected to persist throughout this year. This positive outlook aligns with ongoing trends in the labor market, potentially supporting the Japanese yen against major currency pairs such as USD/JPY. Traders may want to monitor any shifts in wage data as they could influence the exchange rate.

Additionally, the BoJ official downplayed the effects of US trade policies on Japan, suggesting that the impact on the Japanese economy and currency stability will be minimal. This statement may bolster confidence among investors, encouraging trading activity involving the yen. As the market digests these comments, fluctuations in the JPY could be anticipated, particularly in relation to the EUR/JPY and USD/JPY pairs, as traders assess the broader economic implications.

The GBP/USD currency pair is currently trading near a four-week low, hovering just below the key 1.3500 level. The exchange rate has been consolidating its losses over the past three days, with Thursday's Asian session marking the lowest point reached in this recent downturn. The pair's struggle comes amid growing market expectations that the Bank of England may cut interest rates, contributing to bearish sentiment surrounding the British pound.

This downward pressure on the pound is further fueled by concerns over the UK’s economic outlook and speculation that the BoE may ease its monetary policy. Traders are closely watching the 1.3500 support level, which could trigger additional selling if broken. As the pair oscillates within a narrow range, market participants are cautious, awaiting further clues on the BoE's next move and its potential impact on GBP/USD trading in the near term.

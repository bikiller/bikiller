The Japanese Yen (JPY) gained against the U.S. Dollar (USD) during Tuesday's Asian trading session, as it recovered from a two-day losing streak. The Yen touched a one-week low in the previous session but managed to edge higher, with the USD/JPY trading at 132.50. Market participants remain wary of potential intervention by Japan's authorities to curb further JPY depreciation, which has provided some support for the currency.

However, political uncertainty in Japan has capped the Yen's upside. The Japanese government's internal challenges and mixed economic data have kept investors cautious. As a result, the JPY's gains against the USD remain limited, with the currency pair unable to break above key resistance levels. Traders will closely monitor any developments from the Bank of Japan or government actions, which could dictate the Yen's next move.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) is expected to trade within a narrow range against the US Dollar (USD), with analysts from UOB Group suggesting a movement between 0.6655 and 0.6745. Short-term forecasts indicate a more immediate trading band between 0.6670 and 0.6710, as the currency stabilizes rather than continuing its recent decline.

Market sentiment surrounding the AUD remains cautious, influenced by broader economic indicators and the performance of the USD. As traders monitor these levels, the potential for range-bound trading could lead to strategic positioning, impacting speculative trades within the forex market. The current consolidation phase may provide opportunities for traders looking to capitalize on fluctuations within the established levels.

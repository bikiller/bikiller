West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil saw a modest increase, trading at approximately $59.30, up 0.50% for the day. This rise comes as investors remain cautiously optimistic amid ongoing efforts toward a potential peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine. The geopolitical landscape has a significant influence on oil prices, with traders closely watching developments that could stabilize the region and impact global supply.

As attention shifts to the upcoming OPEC+ meeting, the market is bracing for potential shifts in production policies that could further affect prices. The interplay between geopolitical events and OPEC decisions remains crucial for traders managing currency pairs involving USD and EUR, particularly given the oil market's role in influencing exchange rates. With sentiment fluctuating, market participants are carefully assessing the implications of both peace talks and OPEC's strategies on future WTI movements.

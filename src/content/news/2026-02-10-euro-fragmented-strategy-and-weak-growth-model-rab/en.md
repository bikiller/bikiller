Eurozone growth remains sluggish, with Rabobank’s Michael Every highlighting a persistent 1.5% growth trajectory. While German deindustrialisation pressures the region, rearmament efforts and political fragmentation add complexity to the economic landscape. These factors contribute to an overall weak growth model, which leaves the euro (EUR) vulnerable to market volatility. The EUR/USD pair continues to experience fluctuations, with resistance levels seen around 1.0700, while support rests near 1.0500.

The combination of low growth expectations and geopolitical fragmentation is weighing on the euro. Investors are cautious as the Eurozone's economic challenges contrast with the US's relatively stronger growth prospects, placing pressure on the EUR/USD exchange rate. As market participants monitor these dynamics, any signs of increased instability could trigger further downward momentum for the euro, with traders looking to support levels for potential entry points.

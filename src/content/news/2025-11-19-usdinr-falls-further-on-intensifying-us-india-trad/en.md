The Indian Rupee (INR) continued its upward momentum against the US Dollar (USD), marking its fourth consecutive day of gains. On Wednesday, the USD/INR exchange rate dipped to approximately 88.60, reflecting a robust performance by the INR. This bullish movement is largely driven by rising expectations of an imminent trade deal between the United States and India, which has bolstered investor confidence in the Indian economy.

As the market anticipates official announcements, the favorable sentiment surrounding the potential trade agreement is likely to exert further downward pressure on the USD/INR pair. Traders are closely monitoring the situation, as a successful deal could enhance bilateral trade prospects, strengthening the INR even more and potentially altering the dynamics of the currency pair in the coming sessions.

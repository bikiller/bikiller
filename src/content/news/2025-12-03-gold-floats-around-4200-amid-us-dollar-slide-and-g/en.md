Gold prices slipped approximately 0.20% on Wednesday, trading around $4,200 as mixed US economic data continued to fuel speculation regarding a potential rate cut at next week's Federal Reserve meeting. After reaching daily highs of $4,240, XAU/USD found support above the $4,200 mark, reflecting the ongoing volatility in the market linked to USD movements.

The decline in gold prices coincides with a broader slide in the US Dollar, as traders adjust their positions ahead of anticipated shifts in Fed policy. This environment of uncertainty is influencing exchange rates, with the EUR gaining ground against the USD, further impacting the dynamics of gold trading. As the market braces for the Fed's decision, gold remains a critical focus for investors navigating these evolving conditions.

The recent comments from the Federal Reserve have intensified discussions surrounding the de-dollarization trend, particularly impacting the USD. As traders assess the implications of potential shifts in monetary policy, volatility in currency pairs like EUR/USD is expected to rise, with investors closely monitoring the exchange rate fluctuations.

In energy markets, a notable pullback in tensions between the US and Iran led to a significant 5% drop in Brent crude prices.

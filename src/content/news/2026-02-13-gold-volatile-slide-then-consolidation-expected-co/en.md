Gold and silver faced a significant pullback in recent trading, with gold briefly plummeting to a low of $4,900 per ounce before stabilizing around the $5,000 mark. This sharp drop came amid market volatility, driven by fluctuating investor sentiment and global economic uncertainty. Traders watched closely as the precious metal tested key support levels, with some expecting further volatility before a period of consolidation.

Commerzbank’s Commodity Research team projects that gold will continue to experience sharp movements in the short term, with prices hovering near $5,000 per ounce. Market dynamics, including shifts in the USD and fluctuations in major currency pairs like EUR/USD, are likely to influence gold’s trading direction. The current range-bound phase may offer opportunities for traders, with technical levels playing a crucial role in price action as the market seeks stability.

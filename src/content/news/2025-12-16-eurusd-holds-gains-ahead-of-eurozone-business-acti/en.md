EUR/USD maintains its position near two-and-a-half-month highs, trading flat at 1.1750 as the market anticipates key economic indicators. The focus is shifting towards the preliminary Eurozone Manufacturing and Services Purchasing Managers Indexes (PMIs) for December, which could provide insights into the region's economic health. Investors are keen to assess how these figures might influence the currency pair's movement.

In addition to the Eurozone data, traders are also awaiting delayed US employment figures that could impact the USD's strength. The exchange rate's stability reflects a cautious optimism in the market, with participants looking for signals that could guide future trading strategies. As both the EUR and USD await these critical releases, fluctuations in the exchange rate are likely, emphasizing the importance of the upcoming economic data.

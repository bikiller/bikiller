The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) for the fourth consecutive day, hitting a nearly four-week low as it trades just below the 156.00 level. Despite a softer USD, which has shown signs of weakness, the USD/JPY currency pair continues its upward momentum. This persistent bearish trend in the Yen signals ongoing market confidence in the dollar, with traders eyeing a potential push toward the mid-156.00s.

The Yen's weakness is partly attributed to Japan's diverging monetary policy stance from the Federal Reserve, with the Bank of Japan maintaining its ultra-loose policies. Meanwhile, the USD, although experiencing some pullbacks, remains supported by the Fed's hawkish tone and strong US economic fundamentals. As the market prepares for further trading, the USD/JPY exchange rate could continue its upward trajectory unless there are shifts in US economic data or central bank policies.

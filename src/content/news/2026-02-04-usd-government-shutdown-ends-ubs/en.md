The US government shutdown formally ended after President Donald Trump signed a funding bill, removing a short-term political risk for financial markets. According to UBS, the event had little impact on trading conditions, reflecting how routine such episodes have become. The USD showed limited reaction, with currency pair movements remaining subdued as investors largely looked past the headline.

In foreign exchange markets, the muted response underscored a broader focus on macro drivers rather than political noise. Major exchange rates such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY held steady, suggesting traders saw no meaningful shift in fiscal or economic outlook. USD trading flows were dominated by expectations around growth, inflation, and monetary policy rather than shutdown-related uncertainty.

For forex participants, the episode reinforced the idea that US political disruptions now carry diminishing marginal impact on the dollar. With no lasting effect on liquidity or economic data releases, the USD remained range-bound against its peers. As a result, traders continued to prioritize global risk sentiment and central bank signals when positioning across major currency pairs.

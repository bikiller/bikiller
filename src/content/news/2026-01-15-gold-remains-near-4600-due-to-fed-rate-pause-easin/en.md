Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a mild decline on Thursday, trading around $4,600 per troy ounce after reaching a record high of $4,643 in the previous session. The recent price movement reflects a pause in Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, which has eased market tensions and influenced investor sentiment in the precious metal market.

The current trading environment showcases the ongoing dynamics between the gold market and broader economic indicators. As the USD maintains a steady exchange rate, fluctuations in gold prices may continue to attract traders looking for safe-haven assets amid geopolitical uncertainties and potential shifts in monetary policy. With gold hovering near $4,600, market participants remain vigilant for any developments that could impact the currency pair's performance.

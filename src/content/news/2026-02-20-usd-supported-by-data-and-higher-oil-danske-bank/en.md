The US Dollar (USD) is holding onto recent gains, bolstered by rising oil prices and escalating tensions between the US and Iran. With crude prices climbing, the greenback remains supported against major currencies, including the EUR/USD, which is currently trading at 1.0850. The market is factoring in potential disruptions to global oil supplies, lending further strength to the USD.

In addition, the ongoing geopolitical concerns have led to a flight to safety, reinforcing demand for the US Dollar. As a result, traders are eyeing key technical levels, with the USD/JPY pushing toward 150. The outlook for the currency pair remains bullish, but market participants are closely watching any developments in US-Iran relations that could trigger volatility.

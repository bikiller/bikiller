The US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the performance of the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is currently trading around 99.60, stabilizing after a three-day decline. This movement reflects a cautious market sentiment influenced by a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, signaling potential headwinds for the greenback.

As traders assess the implications of the Fed's policies, the DXY's struggles may impact major currency pairs, including EUR/USD, which has seen fluctuations as the euro remains resilient. Market participants are closely monitoring exchange rates, with the index's inability to hold above 100 raising concerns about the dollar's strength in the coming sessions.

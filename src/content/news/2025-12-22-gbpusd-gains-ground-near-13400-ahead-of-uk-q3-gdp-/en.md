GBP/USD is showing signs of recovery, trading around 1.3390 during the Asian session on Monday after three consecutive days of losses. The Pound Sterling is gaining ground as traders await the release of the UK’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data for the third quarter, which is expected to provide insight into the nation's economic health.

Market sentiment remains cautious ahead of the GDP announcement, with the currency pair closely monitored for any volatility. The exchange rate's movement reflects the broader concern over economic performance amid fluctuating global conditions. Investors are likely to react swiftly to the data, potentially impacting GBP/USD trading dynamics in the upcoming sessions.

The Indian Rupee (INR) is under pressure against the US Dollar (USD), trading lower at approximately 90.50. This movement comes as the market anticipates significant trade discussions between the United States and India, which could influence future trade relations and currency valuations. Traders are closely monitoring these talks, with potential implications for the USD/INR exchange rate.

As the day progresses, market sentiment will likely react to the outcomes of the trade negotiations, potentially leading to volatility in the INR. The focus on US-India relations highlights the importance of geopolitical factors in currency trading, as developments could sway investor confidence and impact the overall trading environment for the currency pair.

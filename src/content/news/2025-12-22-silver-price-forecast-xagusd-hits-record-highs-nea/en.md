Silver prices surged 2.5% during the Asian trading session on Monday, reaching a record high near $69.00 for the XAG/USD currency pair. This remarkable uptick is attributed to heightened tensions between Israel and Iran, prompting investors to seek refuge in safe-haven assets. As geopolitical concerns escalate, the appeal of silver as a protective investment grows stronger.

The renewed conflict has influenced market sentiment, leading to increased demand for silver over riskier assets. With the exchange rate for XAG/USD hitting unprecedented levels, traders are closely monitoring developments in the region. The ongoing volatility in global markets may sustain upward pressure on silver prices, highlighting its role as a key safe-haven commodity amid geopolitical uncertainties.

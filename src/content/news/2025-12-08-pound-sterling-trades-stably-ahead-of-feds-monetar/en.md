The Pound Sterling (GBP) is exhibiting stable trading patterns as the week begins, maintaining a position around 1.3320 against the US Dollar (USD). The market appears to be in a cautious hold, with traders awaiting the Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy decisions. This uncertainty may lead to a consolidation phase for the GBP as market participants evaluate potential impacts on exchange rates.

In contrast, the Euro (EUR) remains vigilant, with its movements closely tied to the trends set by the USD. As the Fed's policy stance could influence the broader market dynamics, traders are closely monitoring the GBP/USD currency pair for signals that may emerge in response to economic indicators. Overall, the stability of the Pound suggests a wait-and-see approach, reflecting the cautious sentiment prevailing in the forex market.

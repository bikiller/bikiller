The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling to attract buyers despite some interest from dip-buyers during Thursday's Asian session, where it experienced a slight downturn. The mixed signals from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy, coupled with ongoing uncertainty, are hindering bullish momentum. As a result, the USD/JPY exchange rate remains under pressure, trading around 145.20, reflecting a cautious market sentiment.

Safe-haven flows typically bolster the Yen; however, the lack of clarity regarding the BoJ's future policy directions is keeping traders wary. The EUR/JPY pair is also feeling the impact, hovering near 158.50 as investors weigh the risks associated with both currencies. With volatility expected, market participants will be closely watching for any indicators that could shift the balance in favor of the Yen.

EUR/USD traded flat on Monday, holding steady near the 1.1865 level as investors reacted to disappointing Eurozone industrial output data for December. Factory production fell in line with expectations, signaling a sharp decline that weighed on the euro. Despite the weak economic data, the currency pair showed little movement due to muted trading activity across the market.

The Euro's stability against the USD reflects a cautious market sentiment, with traders awaiting further catalysts for direction. The exchange rate remains near the 1.1865 mark, suggesting that EUR/USD is in a consolidation phase following the recent data release. While the broader economic outlook for the Eurozone faces pressure, the pair’s technical levels have kept it range-bound, limiting volatility for now.

The AUD/JPY currency pair remains largely unchanged around the 109.00 mark during the Asian trading session on Thursday. Despite the release of Australia’s January employment data, the Australian Dollar (AUD) shows little movement against the Japanese Yen (JPY). The report, while shedding light on the local job market, failed to inspire any notable shift in the exchange rate.

Traders continue to watch the 109.00 level for any signs of direction, with market sentiment largely influenced by broader economic factors rather than domestic employment data. The Australian Dollar has been struggling to make significant gains, and the JPY’s safe-haven status keeps it steady against other major currencies, including the USD and EUR.

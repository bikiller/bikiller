The AUD/USD currency pair struggled to maintain momentum at the start of the final trading week of 2025, retreating below the 0.6700 level as market participants shifted towards defensive positions. The recent bullish trend lost steam, reflecting the impact of the year-end slowdown that often characterizes this time of year. As trading volumes diminish, traders are reassessing their strategies.

The exchange rate's decline highlights the cautious sentiment among investors, particularly as they navigate through the holiday season. The Australian dollar's vulnerability against the USD signals a broader trend of risk aversion, with market players favoring safe-haven assets. This retreat could imply further challenges for the AUD in the near term, as traders remain vigilant ahead of potential geopolitical and economic developments.

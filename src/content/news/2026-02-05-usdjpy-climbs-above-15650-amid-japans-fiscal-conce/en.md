The USD/JPY pair extended its rally to around 156.85 during the early Asian session on Thursday, reaching a two-week high. The Japanese Yen weakened significantly against the US Dollar, reflecting concerns over Japan’s fiscal policy. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's expansionary spending measures have raised doubts about Japan's long-term fiscal stability, pushing the Yen lower.

The exchange rate’s climb above 156.50 highlights a growing market unease over Japan's economic health. As the USD continues to outperform the Yen, traders are closely monitoring Japan's fiscal trajectory. With global market conditions in flux, further weakness in JPY could prompt additional volatility in the currency pair.

The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing a downturn, trading below the key psychological level of 155.00. As the early Asian session unfolds, the pair attracts selling interest near 154.80, reflecting a strengthened Japanese Yen against the US Dollar. This shift is largely driven by growing speculation surrounding an upcoming interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), expected to bring rates to 0.75% during Friday's monetary policy meeting.

Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as a rate increase could bolster the yen further, impacting the USD/JPY exchange rate significantly. The potential for change in Japan's monetary policy not only enhances yen buying pressure but also poses implications for broader forex trading strategies, with traders reassessing their positions ahead of the BoJ's decision.

The EUR/USD currency pair remains steady above the 1.1500 level, buoyed by positive Eurozone business activity that suggests the European Central Bank (ECB) may be nearing the end of its easing cycle. Analysts at BBH highlight that this supportive data contributes to a prevailing pause in ECB policy, influencing market sentiment towards the euro.

Despite the firm exchange rate, market participants are still pricing in the possibility of future rate cuts by the ECB. This dynamic keeps traders on alert, as shifts in monetary policy can significantly impact both the euro and the US dollar. As trading continues, the interplay of economic indicators will be crucial in determining the direction of this key forex pair.

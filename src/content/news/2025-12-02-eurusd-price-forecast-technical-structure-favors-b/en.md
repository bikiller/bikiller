The Euro (EUR) is showing a flat performance against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the exchange rate hovering around 1.1607. This pause comes after a robust six-day winning streak, as the currency pair briefly reached over two-week highs on Monday. The steady strength of the Greenback is exerting pressure on the Euro amidst a generally calm trading environment.

Technical indicators suggest a bullish sentiment for the EUR/USD pair, particularly following a recent wedge breakout. Traders are closely monitoring the price action, as maintaining this level could signal further upside potential. The current stability in the exchange rate could lead to increased interest in the Euro, depending on upcoming economic data releases and market sentiment.

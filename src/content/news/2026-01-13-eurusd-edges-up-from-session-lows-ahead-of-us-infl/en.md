EUR/USD has shown signs of recovery after reaching session lows, currently trading at 1.1670. Earlier in the day, the currency pair dipped to 1.1655, reflecting a volatile trading environment as investors await crucial US inflation data. This rebound indicates a potential shift in market sentiment as traders adjust their positions ahead of economic indicators.

The movement of EUR/USD is closely tied to fluctuations in the USD, with the upcoming inflation report expected to influence the exchange rate significantly. As market participants gauge the implications of the data on future Federal Reserve monetary policy, the currency pair's performance will likely remain volatile. The current trading level suggests traders are cautiously optimistic, yet the situation remains fluid as they look for clarity from the US economic landscape.

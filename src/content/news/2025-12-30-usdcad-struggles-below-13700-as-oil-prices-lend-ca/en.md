The USD/CAD currency pair is experiencing downward pressure, trading around 1.3680 during Tuesday's Asian session after a brief uptick in the previous day. The exchange rate struggles to hold above the critical 1.3700 level, reflecting the Canadian Dollar's resilience, particularly as oil prices provide added support.

This movement in USD/CAD highlights the ongoing influence of commodity prices on the Canadian currency. As oil remains a significant driver for the Canadian economy, shifts in its pricing can directly impact the exchange rate, creating volatility in trading. Market participants will be closely monitoring both oil developments and broader economic indicators for further direction in this currency pair.

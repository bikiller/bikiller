The USD/CAD currency pair has rebounded to around 1.3980 during Monday's Asian trading hours, recovering some of the losses experienced recently. This upward movement comes despite positive Canadian GDP data, suggesting that investor sentiment may be shifting. The exchange rate indicates a cautious optimism as market participants weigh the implications of upcoming economic indicators.

However, potential gains for the USD/CAD may be limited by increasing speculation around a possible interest rate cut from the US Federal Reserve this month. As traders monitor these developments, the currency pair remains under pressure, highlighting the delicate balance between Canadian economic performance and US monetary policy expectations. The 1.3950 level serves as a technical benchmark that traders will be watching closely in the coming sessions.

This stability follows a session of modest gains as market participants maintain a cautious stance ahead of the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data release. 

Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate as the US CPI data could significantly impact the USD’s strength against the CAD. Any surprising figures could lead to volatility in the forex market, influencing trading strategies and positioning ahead of the data.

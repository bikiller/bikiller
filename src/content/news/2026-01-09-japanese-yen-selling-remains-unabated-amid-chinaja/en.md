The Japanese Yen (JPY) has fallen to a nearly three-week low against the US Dollar (USD), with the exchange rate showing increased vulnerability as trading continues into the European session on Friday. Concerns over a growing rift between China and Japan, coupled with doubts surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy, have contributed to the downward pressure on the Yen.

As the USD strengthens broadly, the JPY is facing challenges that could see it slide further. The current trading environment reflects broader market anxieties, with investors closely monitoring geopolitical tensions and central bank signals. This backdrop may prompt traders to reassess their positions in the JPY, potentially leading to increased volatility in currency pairs involving the Yen.

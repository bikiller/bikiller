The AUD/USD currency pair has seen a notable correction, dipping to around 0.6620 during Wednesday's European trading session. This move comes after the pair recently peaked at an almost three-month high of 0.6686, reflecting the ongoing fluctuations in the foreign exchange market.

The strengthening US Dollar has played a crucial role in this pullback, as traders turn their attention to the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data. This key economic indicator is expected to influence market sentiment, potentially impacting the exchange rate further as participants assess inflationary trends and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook.

AUD/USD remains steady around the exchange rate of 0.6640 on Monday, following a robust four-day rally that propelled the currency pair to its highest levels in two months. This consolidation reflects a cautious approach from investors as they await critical monetary policy announcements from both the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Federal Reserve (Fed).

As the trading week unfolds, market participants are closely monitoring the RBA's decision scheduled for Tuesday and the Fed's announcement on Wednesday. The outcomes of these meetings could significantly influence the AUD/USD dynamics, particularly given the recent shifts in the RBA's outlook. With the Fed's policy direction also on the horizon, volatility may increase as traders position themselves ahead of these pivotal events.

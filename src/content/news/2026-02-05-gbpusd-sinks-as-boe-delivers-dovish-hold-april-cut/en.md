The Pound Sterling sharply declined against the US Dollar after the Bank of England (BoE) opted to hold interest rates, signaling a potential path toward further easing. This decision, viewed as a "dovish hold," raised expectations that rate cuts could be on the horizon. As a result, GBP/USD plunged to 1.3529, marking a 0.90% drop in value.

Despite weaker-than-expected US jobs data failing to provide support, the Sterling's slide continued. Traders fully priced in an April rate cut from the BoE, which weighed heavily on GBP/USD, reinforcing the bearish sentiment. As the pair nears crucial technical levels, further downside pressure could materialize, leaving the outlook for the Pound increasingly uncertain.

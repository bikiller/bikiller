The EUR/USD currency pair continues to struggle, losing ground for the fourth consecutive session and trading around 1.1760 during Monday's Asian trading hours. The exchange rate is approaching significant technical support, testing the nine-day EMA near the 1.1750 level, signaling a potential shift in market sentiment.

Technical analysis on the daily chart reveals a weakening bullish bias, as the pair attempts to break below the lower boundary of the ascending channel pattern. This movement could suggest further downside potential for the euro as it faces increasing pressure against the USD, raising concerns among traders about the sustainability of any upward momentum.

The US Dollar (USD) strengthened as traders positioned themselves ahead of the holidays, bolstered by a Trump-imposed blockade on Venezuelan oil. This geopolitical factor has added momentum to the greenback's rise against major currencies. As of now, the USD has shown resilience, with the EUR/USD exchange rate reflecting a notable shift in market sentiment.

Despite the current firmness in the USD, slowing labor market trends are raising expectations that the Federal Reserve may adopt a more aggressive easing strategy by 2026.

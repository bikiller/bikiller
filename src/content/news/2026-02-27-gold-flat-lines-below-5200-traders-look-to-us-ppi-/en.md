Gold (XAU/USD) struggles to maintain momentum after a slight uptick in recent sessions, holding steady below the $5,200 level during the early part of the European trading session on Friday. Despite recent gains, geopolitical concerns continue to weigh on the market, with escalating tensions in the Middle East following a significant buildup of US naval and air forces in the region. 

Traders are now eyeing the upcoming US Producer Price Index (PPI) data for further direction. A stronger-than-expected reading could lend support to the USD, potentially pressuring gold prices lower. With the EUR/USD exchange rate also in focus, the broader market sentiment remains cautious as investors anticipate more economic signals from the US, which could provide fresh impetus for the currency pairs and precious metals markets.

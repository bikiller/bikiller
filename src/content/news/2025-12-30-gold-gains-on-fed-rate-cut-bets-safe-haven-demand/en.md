Gold prices (XAU/USD) climbed above $4,350 during Asian trading hours on Tuesday, rebounding from a significant decline. The precious metal had experienced its most substantial drop since October, plunging 4.5% in the previous session amid concerns over monetary policy shifts from the Federal Reserve.

The uptick in gold prices reflects increasing safe-haven demand as traders bet on potential rate cuts by the Fed. This shift in sentiment, coupled with fluctuations in the USD exchange rate, is likely to influence investor behavior in the coming sessions, as market participants assess the implications for the broader economic landscape and currency pairs like EUR/USD.

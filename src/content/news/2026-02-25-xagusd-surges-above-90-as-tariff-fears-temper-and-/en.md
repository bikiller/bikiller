XAG/USD surged by around 4% on Tuesday, reaching near $91 as safe-haven demand drove the rally. The move comes as fears over tariffs eased, boosting investor confidence in silver. This uptick marks a sharp recovery from the pair's dramatic plunge in late January, where prices fell from record highs above $121 to a low of around $64 in early February, a nearly 47% drop.

The rally is fueled by an ongoing supply deficit in silver, alongside the broader market's risk-off sentiment. As the exchange rate of XAG/USD continues to rise, traders are eyeing potential further gains, with resistance levels now looming near $95. The shift in market dynamics underscores the ongoing volatility in commodity markets, especially for precious metals like silver.

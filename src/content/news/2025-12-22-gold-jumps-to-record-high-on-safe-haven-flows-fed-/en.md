Gold prices surged to an all-time high near $4,300 during Asian trading hours on Monday, driven by safe-haven flows amid growing expectations of interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve. The XAU/USD currency pair gained momentum as traders reacted to indicators of softer inflation and a slowdown in job growth in the US, prompting a flight to the precious metal.

As investors seek refuge in gold amid uncertainty in the USD, the implications for the forex market are significant.

The recent movements highlight the interconnectedness of commodities and currency trading, positioning gold as a focal point in the current market landscape.

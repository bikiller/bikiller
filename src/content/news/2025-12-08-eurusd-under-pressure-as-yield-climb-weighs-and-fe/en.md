EUR/USD is feeling the pressure as it dips 0.05% to an exchange rate of 1.1637 at the start of the week. The decline is attributed to a broader strength in the US Dollar, which is affecting trading dynamics amid a backdrop of volatility. Earlier, the currency pair reached a high of 1.1672 but has since retraced as market participants prepare for the impending Federal Reserve monetary policy decision.

The rise in US Treasury yields is contributing to the dollar's strength, prompting traders to closely watch the Fed's next moves. With uncertainty surrounding interest rate changes, the EUR/USD pair is experiencing choppy trading as investors weigh potential implications on future exchange rates. As the market awaits the Fed's announcement, volatility is likely to persist, further influencing the euro's performance against the dollar.

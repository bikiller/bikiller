The USD/CAD currency pair is trading higher at approximately 1.3790 during the early European session on Friday. This upward movement follows a period of volatility caused by disappointing U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November, which initially pressured the US Dollar. As traders assess this economic indicator, the USD has begun to regain its footing against the Canadian Dollar.

Despite the recent gains, the exchange rate remains broadly sideways, struggling to break above the critical resistance level of 1.3800. With market participants closely monitoring economic developments, any further fluctuations in the USD could impact the outlook for the USD/CAD pair. The interplay between U.S. economic data and commodity prices will continue to shape trading strategies in the days ahead.

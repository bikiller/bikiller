The NZD/USD currency pair has pulled back from a six-month high, currently trading at approximately 0.6030, reflecting a decline of 0.20% on the day. This retreat comes as the US dollar experiences a rebound, driven by market anticipation ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy decision. Traders are closely monitoring this pivotal moment, which could significantly impact the exchange rate dynamics.

As the focus shifts to the Fed's actions, the market sentiment surrounding the NZD/USD could shift further. A stronger USD may pressure the New Zealand dollar, while any dovish signals from the Fed could support the kiwi. Investors are advised to stay alert to the developments, as these factors will likely dictate the short-term trading trajectory of the currency pair in the coming sessions.

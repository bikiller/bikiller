The AUD/JPY currency pair has declined to around 106.45 during the early European session on Tuesday, reflecting a shift in market sentiment. The Japanese Yen is gaining strength against the Australian Dollar as traders seek refuge in safe-haven currencies. This move comes in response to renewed tariff threats from US President Donald Trump, which have heightened concerns about global economic stability.

As traders assess the implications of these developments, attention turns to upcoming Australian employment data, which could influence future trading decisions. The current exchange rate indicates a cautious outlook for the AUD, as the market weighs potential volatility linked to geopolitical tensions and economic indicators. The interplay between safe-haven demand and economic data will be crucial in shaping the AUD/JPY's trajectory in the near term.

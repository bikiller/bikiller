The EUR/USD currency pair has seen a reversal in its upward momentum, currently trading at 1.1710 after facing resistance at the 1.1740 level. Market participants are closely monitoring this shift, as the dollar strengthens, impacting the exchange rate and overall trading sentiment.

With German inflation data in the spotlight, traders are keenly assessing how these figures might influence the European Central Bank's policy decisions. As the USD gains traction, the interplay between these economic indicators may lead to increased volatility in the forex market, affecting future movements of the EUR/USD pair.

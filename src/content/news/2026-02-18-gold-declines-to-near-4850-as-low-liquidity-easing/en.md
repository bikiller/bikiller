Gold prices (XAU/USD) saw a slight decline, trading near $4,860 during the early Asian session on Wednesday. The precious metal faced downward pressure due to low market liquidity, as much of Asia remains closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. This lack of trading activity contributed to reduced demand for gold, pushing prices lower.

The weakening of tensions in global markets also played a role in the drop, as investors turned away from safe-haven assets like gold. With the market focused on other priorities, the impact of lower demand combined with thin trading conditions resulted in the drop to around $4,860. As the holiday period continues, volatility may remain subdued until liquidity improves.

Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a period of consolidation below the $4,350 mark, with the exchange rate currently trading around $4,321. The precious metal's upward momentum is being restrained by a firm US Dollar (USD), which has maintained its strength against a backdrop of mixed economic data.

Despite a slight dip to a daily low of $4,309, gold's performance remains relatively stable as traders assess the impact of the USD's resilience. The interplay between the stronger dollar and gold's price movements highlights the ongoing challenges for bullish positions in the precious metal market. As market participants continue to monitor global economic signals, gold's trajectory will depend heavily on shifts in the currency dynamics, particularly against currencies like the EUR and JPY.

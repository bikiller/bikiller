Gold (XAU/USD) continues its downward trend, trading around $4,590 on Friday, marking a decline for the second consecutive session. The precious metal's prices have been affected by a noticeable drop in safe-haven demand, driven by easing geopolitical tensions in Iran. This shift has led investors to reassess their positions in the gold market.

As a result, the exchange rate for gold is reflecting a broader trend in the commodities market. With the easing of risks, traders are pivoting their focus towards higher-yielding assets, which could further impact gold's performance in the coming sessions. The current trading environment suggests that the allure of gold as a safe-haven asset may diminish, influencing investor strategies and overall market dynamics.

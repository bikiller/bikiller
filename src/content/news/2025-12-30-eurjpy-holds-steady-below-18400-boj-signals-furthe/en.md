The EUR/JPY currency pair is trading in a narrow range around 183.80 during early European hours on Tuesday, maintaining a steady position below the critical level of 184.00. This stability comes as market participants anticipate further interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) in 2026, which may strengthen the Japanese Yen (JPY) against the Euro (EUR).

The prospect of BoJ tightening could have significant implications for the exchange rate, potentially enhancing JPY's attractiveness amid a backdrop of rising rates. As traders monitor developments, the EUR/JPY cross remains cautious, reflecting the broader challenges in the forex market and the interplay between monetary policies influencing both currencies.

GBP/JPY continues its strong upward momentum, gaining more than 0.80% for the second consecutive day. The currency pair is currently trading at 211.94, just shy of its high for the day, 212.12. This rally comes as the Japanese yen weakens following Japanese Prime Minister Takaichi’s nomination of two “dovish” academics to the Bank of Japan's board. 

With the resistance at 211.50 cleared, GBP/JPY is now targeting the key psychological level of 212.00. The ongoing weakness in the yen and dovish signals from the BoJ are likely to support further gains for the pair. Traders will keep an eye on any developments related to the Bank of Japan's monetary policy for further direction in the exchange rate.

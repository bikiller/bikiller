The Japanese Yen (JPY) is currently showing resilience against a generally weaker US Dollar (USD) during the early European session on Wednesday. The USD/JPY exchange rate is hovering around 110.50, reflecting a cautious optimism among Yen bulls; however, the lack of bullish momentum indicates underlying hesitancy. Concerns regarding Japan's fiscal situation are tempering expectations for any aggressive monetary policy shifts by the Bank of Japan (BoJ).

As traders eye the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, sentiment around the JPY remains mixed. While the Yen benefits from the USD's weakness, uncertainty over potential BoJ rate hikes continues to loom. The EUR/JPY pair also sees moderate movement, maintaining a range around 130.00. Analysts suggest that until there’s clarity on fiscal policies and the Fed's stance, the JPY may continue to tread cautiously in the market.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) is experiencing a slight decline in the Asian session on Wednesday as traders adopt a cautious approach ahead of the Bank of Japan (BoJ) policy meeting. Investors are strategically waiting for insights from the two-day meeting, which concludes on Friday, before committing to new positions. This cautious sentiment reflects a broader uncertainty in the currency market, particularly concerning the JPY's exchange rate against major currencies like the USD and EUR.

Market analysts are closely monitoring the BoJ's forthcoming decisions, as they could significantly impact trading dynamics. The current exchange rate of JPY/USD has traders on alert, with potential bullish trends remaining intact. As the market anticipates the BoJ's stance on monetary policy, any shifts in strategy could either bolster the Yen or exacerbate its current downward trajectory, influencing overall forex market sentiment.

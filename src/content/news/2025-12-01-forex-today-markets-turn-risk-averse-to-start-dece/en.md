Markets opened December with a risk-averse sentiment as investors shifted focus amid ongoing economic uncertainties. The EUR/USD traded around 1.0500, reflecting a slight decline of 0.3%, while the USD/JPY hovered near 135.50, up 0.2%. The U.S. dollar gained traction as traders assessed the implications of recent economic data, with heightened volatility expected in the coming sessions.

Concerns over inflation and potential interest rate adjustments by central banks have weighed on market sentiment, leading to a cautious approach among traders. The GBP/USD fell to 1.2000, down 0.4%, as the UK economy faces ongoing challenges. As the week progresses, market participants will closely monitor geopolitical developments and economic indicators that could further influence exchange rates and trading strategies.

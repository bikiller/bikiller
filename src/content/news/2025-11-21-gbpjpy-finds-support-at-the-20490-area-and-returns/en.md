GBP/JPY found support in the 204.90 region, allowing the pair to bounce back to 205.40 after reaching session lows of 204.80 earlier in the day. This recovery shows the Pound is trimming its previous losses, stabilizing in the mid-range of the 205.00s as traders reassess market positions.

The recent fluctuations in the GBP/JPY currency pair highlight the ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange market. With the Pound showing resilience, traders are closely monitoring this exchange rate for further developments, particularly in relation to broader trends against major currencies like USD and EUR. The ability to hold above 205.00 may set the stage for future gains if buying interest persists.

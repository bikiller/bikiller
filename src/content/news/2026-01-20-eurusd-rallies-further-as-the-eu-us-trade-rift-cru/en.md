The EUR/USD currency pair has continued its upward trajectory, gaining for a second consecutive day on Tuesday, with the exchange rate nearing 1.1700. This rally is primarily driven by a notable weakness in the US Dollar (USD), as concerns surrounding the ongoing EU-US trade rift weigh on the greenback.

As traders react to the shifting dynamics between the European Union and the United States, the EUR has found renewed strength. Market sentiment remains cautious, and the implications of these developments could lead to further volatility in the USD, impacting future trading decisions in the forex market.

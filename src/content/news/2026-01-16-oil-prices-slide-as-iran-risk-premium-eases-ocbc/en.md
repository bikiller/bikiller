Oil prices have sharply declined after hitting a two-month high, largely influenced by easing geopolitical tensions surrounding Iran. Analysts from OCBC, Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong, attribute this pullback to reassurances from President Trump that mitigated fears of imminent disruptions to Iranian oil supply. This change in sentiment has prompted traders to reassess the risk premium previously placed on oil pricing.

As a result, the easing in oil prices has implications for currency pairs, particularly in relation to the USD and EUR. A decrease in oil prices can lead to a stronger USD as lower energy costs may alleviate inflation pressures, thereby impacting the exchange rate dynamics. Traders are now closely monitoring these developments, which could influence future forex trading strategies.

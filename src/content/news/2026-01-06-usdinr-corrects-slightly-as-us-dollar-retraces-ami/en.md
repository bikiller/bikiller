The Indian Rupee (INR) showed resilience against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, recovering from a three-day decline. The USD/INR currency pair corrected to approximately 90.35 as traders reacted to a risk-on sentiment in the market. This shift came after the US Dollar Index (DXY) plummeted sharply to a three-week low of 98.86 on Monday, indicating a retreat in demand for the greenback.

As the USD retraced, the favorable exchange rate for the INR reflected increased investor confidence. The recent movements highlight the volatility in forex trading, where shifts in market sentiment can lead to significant fluctuations in currency pairs. Traders will be closely monitoring the DXY and broader market indicators to gauge potential future direction for the USD/INR exchange rate.

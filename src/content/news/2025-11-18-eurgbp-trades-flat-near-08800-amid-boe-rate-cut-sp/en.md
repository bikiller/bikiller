EUR/GBP is trading flat around the 0.8810 mark during the early European session on Tuesday. This stability comes amidst growing speculation surrounding a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE). The recent release of weak UK Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data has intensified concerns over the British economy, which could lead to a depreciation of the Pound Sterling (GBP) against the Euro (EUR).

As traders assess the implications of the BoE's monetary policy, the exchange rate remains sensitive to economic indicators. A lower interest rate could diminish the appeal of the GBP, further impacting the EUR/GBP currency pair. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as any signs of a BoE rate cut could significantly influence trading strategies and drive the exchange rate below current levels.

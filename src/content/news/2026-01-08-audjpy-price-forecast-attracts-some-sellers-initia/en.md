The AUD/JPY currency pair experienced a downturn early Thursday, attracting sellers and trading around the 105.00 mark. This movement comes as the Japanese Yen gains strength against the Australian Dollar, reflecting a broader sentiment in the market regarding the Bank of Japan's commitment to its policy normalization strategy. 

As the exchange rate hovers above the initial support level of 102.50, traders are closely monitoring developments that could influence the pair's trajectory. The current environment underscores the ongoing volatility in forex markets, with key players assessing the potential impacts of monetary policy shifts from central banks, particularly the BoJ's stance on interest rates.

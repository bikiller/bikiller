Silver (XAG/USD) soared to new heights on Friday, reaching a fresh record high of $64.62 before consolidating above the $64.00 level. The precious metal's rally marks the fourth consecutive day of gains, driven by a weakening US Dollar, which has struggled to maintain momentum amid a calm market environment. 

As traders focus on the currency pair's upward trajectory, the strong performance of silver suggests a growing demand for safe-haven assets. The exchange rate reflects investor sentiment, with the USD losing ground against other currencies. This trend could have broader implications for the forex market, influencing trading strategies and monetary policy considerations in the coming days.

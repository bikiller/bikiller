Gold (XAU/USD) demonstrated resilience during the North American session on Friday, maintaining a strong position above the $4,200 mark. As the market prepares for the upcoming Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting next week, traders remain focused on how potential interest rate cuts could influence the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.

The anticipation surrounding the Fed's decision has kept market participants on edge, contributing to gold's steady performance. With the yellow metal nearly flat for the week, investors are closely monitoring the impact of any shifts in U.S. monetary policy, particularly as it relates to the broader forex market and the valuation of the USD against the EUR and other major currencies.

The Euro (EUR) faced downward pressure against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Thursday, with the EUR/JPY exchange rate slipping amid a strengthening Yen. The Yen's rally is largely attributed to increasing expectations surrounding a potential interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) at its monetary policy meeting scheduled for December 19. This speculation has led to a shift in market sentiment, favoring the JPY over major currencies.

As traders adjust their positions in light of these developments, the EUR/JPY pair is showing signs of volatility. Analysts suggest that if the BoJ follows through with a rate hike, it could further enhance the Yen's appeal, potentially impacting the broader market. The current trading environment underscores the importance of monitoring central bank signals, as shifts in monetary policy can have significant implications for currency valuation and exchange rates.

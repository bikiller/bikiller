USD/JPY is currently trading at 155.70, exhibiting a subdued performance as the market anticipates the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) upcoming rate decision for December. The momentum for the currency pair appears mildly bearish, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing signs of decline, indicating potential weakness in buying pressure.

As traders brace for the BoJ's policy announcement, the exchange rate reflects caution in the market. The implications of the decision could significantly influence the USD/JPY's trajectory, especially if a rate hike materializes, potentially altering the dynamics of trading for this major currency pair. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, as they could create opportunities or risks in the forex market.

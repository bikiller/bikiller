The Canadian Dollar (CAD) remained largely unchanged against major currencies, with weakness in oil prices outweighing the boost from improved risk sentiment. Despite brief market optimism, CAD/USD showed minimal movement, reflecting ongoing uncertainty. As global geopolitical tensions persist, the loonie faces continued pressure, with traders wary of potential volatility in oil markets.

Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, note that while short-term trading has been relatively stable, the broader outlook for the CAD remains influenced by global events. Any escalation in geopolitical risks could create further headwinds for the currency, particularly as oil prices, a key driver for the Canadian economy, struggle to gain momentum.

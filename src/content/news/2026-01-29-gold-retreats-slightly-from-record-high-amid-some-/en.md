Gold (XAU/USD) has retreated slightly from its recent record high as traders engage in some profit-taking. After reaching an all-time peak of $5,550 earlier in the European session, the precious metal is trading below this level, although it remains on an impressive upward trajectory, marking its ninth consecutive day of gains. 

Market analysts suggest that the bullish potential for gold remains intact despite the slight pullback. Factors contributing to the ongoing strength include a weaker USD and geopolitical uncertainties that continue to drive demand for safe-haven assets. As the trading session unfolds, investors will be closely monitoring both the exchange rate fluctuations and economic indicators that may influence gold's performance in the coming days.

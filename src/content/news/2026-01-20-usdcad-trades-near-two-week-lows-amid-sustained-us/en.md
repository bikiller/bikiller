The Canadian Dollar (CAD) continues to strengthen against the US Dollar (USD) as of Tuesday, with the USD/CAD currency pair trading around 1.3830, marking a near two-week low. This upward movement for the CAD is attributed to ongoing trade tensions between the United States and the European Union, which have put significant downward pressure on the Greenback.

As these trade concerns escalate, the exchange rate reflects a broader sentiment in the market, where traders are increasingly wary of the USD's stability. The CAD's gains highlight a shift in investor confidence, suggesting that the implications of these geopolitical factors may persist in influencing trading dynamics for both currencies in the near term.

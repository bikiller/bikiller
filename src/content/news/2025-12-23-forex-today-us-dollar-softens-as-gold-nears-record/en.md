The US Dollar Index (DXY) struggled to gain traction on Tuesday, hovering around the 98.00 level after dipping to a three-month low during Asian trading hours. This softening of the USD comes despite the release of robust US Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data, which typically bolsters the currency. The lack of demand for the DXY suggests a cautious sentiment in the market as year-end trading approaches.

Meanwhile, gold prices are on the rise, edging closer to record highs, further pressuring the greenback. As traders look for safe havens amid global uncertainties, the strengthening of precious metals often inversely affects the USD. The currency pairs involving the euro and the yen reflect this trend, with EUR/USD and USD/JPY seeing notable fluctuations as investors adjust their strategies in response to these developments.

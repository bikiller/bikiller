Rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, particularly surrounding Iran, have begun reshaping the outlook for global oil markets, according to TD Securities analysts Ryan McKay and Daniel Ghali. Oil prices have been volatile, with Brent crude hovering around $90 per barrel, driven by concerns over potential disruptions in supply. The uncertainty has sparked fluctuations in energy-related currency pairs, with the USD/CAD and EUR/USD seeing increased volatility as investors hedge against oil price movements.

As these geopolitical risks intensify, oil price swings are expected to impact broader forex trading dynamics. The U.S. dollar, traditionally a safe-haven asset, has been strengthening in response to the market's flight to safety, driving the USD/JPY and USD/CHF pairs higher. Meanwhile, oil-dependent currencies like the Canadian dollar are under pressure, as fluctuations in crude prices continue to influence trading. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, aware that further escalation could amplify the risks, potentially sending oil prices past critical technical levels.

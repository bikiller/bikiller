The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) is expected to maintain its Official Cash Rate (OCR) at 2.25%, but traders anticipate the central bank will bring forward its projected interest rate hikes. Brown Brothers Harriman’s Elias Haddad highlights that with inflation still elevated and the labor market showing signs of improvement, the RBNZ is likely to adjust its projections to signal a tighter policy stance. This shift is expected to support the NZD in the near term.

The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) is likely to find further support from the hawkish tone of the RBNZ, as it contrasts with the dovish outlook of other central banks. As NZD/USD trading remains sensitive to the central bank’s actions, a shift in expectations could influence the exchange rate. Traders will be watching for updates to the RBNZ’s forward guidance, which could boost the NZD further if rate hikes are anticipated sooner than previously expected.

EUR/USD has remained in a narrow range as markets absorb the impact of the US Supreme Court ruling on tariffs. The decision, which affects trade policies, has led to the introduction of new replacement levies, keeping traders on edge. This uncertainty has resulted in sideways movement for the currency pair, with the exchange rate fluctuating between key technical levels.

Currently, the EUR/USD pair is trading with little momentum, hovering around 1.0700. Market participants are watching closely for further developments on tariffs and any shifts in US economic policy. With the near-term outlook uncertain, analysts expect the pair to continue its consolidation until clearer direction emerges from ongoing trade talks and economic data.

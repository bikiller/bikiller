Gold (XAU/USD) soared to new record highs near $5,300 on Wednesday, marking the continuation of an impressive rally that has persisted for eight consecutive days. The precious metal's ascent has been largely driven by heightened safe-haven demand amid ongoing market uncertainties and a softer US Dollar (USD), prompting traders to seek refuge in gold as a stable asset.

As market participants await the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, the exchange rate dynamics are creating a favorable environment for gold. The decline in the USD has not only bolstered gold prices but has also influenced trading across other currency pairs, including EUR/USD, as investors reassess their strategies in light of potential shifts in monetary policy. This persistent bullish momentum in gold highlights its appeal as an inflation hedge and a go-to asset in volatile times.

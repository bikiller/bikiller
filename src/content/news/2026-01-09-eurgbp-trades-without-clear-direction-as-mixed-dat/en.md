EUR/GBP is trading around 0.8670 on Friday, showing little movement from the previous day. The currency pair encountered resistance at the 0.8690 level on Thursday, failing to gain traction above this technical threshold. Mixed economic data has contributed to the uncertain market outlook, leaving traders cautious.

The lack of direction in the exchange rate can be attributed to conflicting signals from both the Eurozone and the UK, impacting investor sentiment. As traders assess the implications of recent data releases, the EUR/GBP pair remains in a tight range, reflecting a broader hesitation in the forex market as investors weigh potential shifts in monetary policy from both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England.

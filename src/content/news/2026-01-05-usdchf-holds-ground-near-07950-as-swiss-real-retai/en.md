The USD/CHF currency pair remains steady around the exchange rate of 0.7950 as Swiss Real Retail Sales data disappoints. November sales rose by 2.3% year-over-year, notably below the anticipated 2.9%. However, this figure did reflect an improvement over the previously reported increase of 2.2%, which was revised down from 2.7%.

This miss in retail sales expectations has implications for the Swiss economy, potentially impacting future monetary policy decisions. Traders are likely to monitor these developments closely as they assess the resilience of the Swiss franc against the dollar amidst ongoing market fluctuations. The current stability in USD/CHF highlights the dollar's strength in this trading environment, even as Swiss economic data falls short.

USD/JPY is trading around 156.40 on Tuesday, reflecting a decline of 0.40% for the day. This movement comes despite the US Dollar's strength, bolstered by several better-than-expected economic indicators from the United States. The robust data had initially suggested a potential uptrend for the USD, yet the exchange rate has faced downward pressure.

The renewed strength of the Japanese Yen is primarily responsible for this shift in the currency pair. As traders react to the Yen's resilience, the bullish sentiment surrounding the USD seems to be waning. This dynamic highlights the complex interplay between economic data and forex market sentiment, underscoring the importance of ongoing developments in both the US and Japanese economies.

AUD/USD is hovering near three-year highs after a decisive breakout above the key 0.7000 psychological level, marking its first move beyond that threshold since February 2023. The currency pair’s exchange rate surge reflects broad US Dollar weakness, with traders selling USD across major forex markets as risk sentiment improves and demand shifts toward higher-yielding currencies.

Support for the Australian Dollar has also been boosted by the Reserve Bank of Australia’s unexpected policy move. At its February meeting, the RBA delivered a surprise 25 basis point rate hike, lifting the cash rate to 3.85%. This tightening stance has strengthened AUD buying interest, widening yield differentials against the USD and reinforcing bullish momentum in AUD/USD trading.

The break above 0.7000 carries important technical implications, potentially opening the door for further upside if buyers maintain control. Market participants will now watch upcoming US and EUR-linked economic data, alongside Federal Reserve expectations, for clues on whether US Dollar weakness will persist and keep AUD/USD supported near multi-year peaks.

NZD/USD is trading around 0.6000 on Friday, showing a modest gain of 0.19% on the day. The New Zealand Dollar is benefiting from a pullback in the US Dollar as traders adopt a cautious approach ahead of upcoming US economic data. The currency pair's movement reflects a broader weakness in the USD, which is awaiting fresh signals on the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy stance.

Support for NZD/USD is also driven by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's optimistic growth outlook, which has helped buoy the Kiwi despite broader market uncertainty. As the US Dollar faces downward pressure, the NZD maintains a stable foothold at the key 0.6000 level. Market participants remain focused on upcoming data that could shape the Fed's next steps and further influence the exchange rate.

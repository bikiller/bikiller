USD/CHF trades sideways near the 0.7750 exchange rate on Wednesday, with the currency pair showing little net change during European trading. Price action remains compressed in a narrow range as the USD struggles to build momentum after disappointing US labor data and a batch of mixed macroeconomic releases. The lack of a clear catalyst has kept short-term trading subdued.

The softer tone in US data has tempered expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve easing, leaving the USD without strong directional support against major peers, including the Swiss Franc and the EUR. As a result, the USD/CHF pair continues to oscillate without conviction, reflecting broader uncertainty across forex markets as traders reassess the outlook for US growth and monetary policy.

On the Swiss side, the Swiss National Bank remains vigilant, reinforcing the Franc’s role as a defensive currency. While no immediate policy signals emerged, the SNB’s cautious stance limits downside risks for CHF crosses. For now, the USD/CHF exchange rate is likely to remain range-bound around 0.7750, with traders awaiting clearer signals from upcoming US data to determine the next directional move.

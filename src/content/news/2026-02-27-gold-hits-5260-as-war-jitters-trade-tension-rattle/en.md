Gold surged past $5,260 on Friday, driven by heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran, alongside a hot inflation report. The precious metal's rally, climbing over 1.20%, was a response to growing geopolitical uncertainty and fears of escalating conflict. The U.S. dollar (USD) saw some volatility as risk sentiment took a hit, while traders flocked to gold as a safe-haven asset.

The inflation data, signaling persistent price pressures in the U.S., contributed to the spike, influencing both the U.S. Dollar Index and major currency pairs. In the forex market, the EUR/USD exchange rate experienced a dip, as the dollar firmed amid risk-off sentiment. As geopolitical risks remain high, gold's rise could continue to pressure the USD, with investors closely monitoring any further escalation in U.S.-Iran relations.

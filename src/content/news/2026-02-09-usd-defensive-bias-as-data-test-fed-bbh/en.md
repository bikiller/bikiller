The US Dollar is expected to trade on the defensive this week as market participants respond to signs of labor market softness and easing inflation. Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH) highlights that these economic indicators are influencing Fed funds futures, which are pricing in a 50 basis point cut in interest rates by year-end. This sentiment may lead to further downward pressure on the USD against major currency pairs.

As traders adjust their positions, the USD/EUR exchange rate could come under increased scrutiny. A weaker dollar would likely bolster the Euro, potentially pushing the currency pair higher. Analysts are closely monitoring these developments, as they could have significant implications for trading strategies in the forex market moving forward. As economic data continues to unfold, the outlook for the dollar remains cautiously bearish.

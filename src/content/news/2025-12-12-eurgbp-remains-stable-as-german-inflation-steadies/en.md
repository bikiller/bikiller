EUR/GBP is trading in a narrow range around 0.8760, reflecting a lack of clear direction as market participants assess mixed economic signals from the Eurozone and the UK. German inflation figures have stabilized, providing some support for the euro, while the UK faces weakening GDP data that casts doubt on the strength of the pound.

The contrasting economic landscapes have left the currency pair relatively stable, with traders weighing the implications of these developments. The current exchange rate suggests that sentiment remains cautious, as investors look for further signs of economic recovery or deterioration before committing to significant positions in this trading pair.

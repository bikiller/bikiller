The Japanese Yen (JPY) is showing strength as it maintains a bid tone during the early European trading session. This movement is supported by a prevailing bearish sentiment surrounding the US Dollar (USD), which has kept the USD/JPY pair trading below the critical psychological level of 155.00. Traders are closely monitoring this behavior ahead of the upcoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) decision on Friday.

The ongoing pressure on the USD, coupled with the Yen's resilience, suggests potential for further appreciation. As the market awaits insights from the BoJ, the exchange rate dynamics may shift significantly, influencing not only the USD/JPY pair but also broader currency movements against the Euro (EUR) and other major currencies. The upcoming monetary policy announcement could serve as a pivotal moment for traders looking to capitalize on volatility in the forex market.

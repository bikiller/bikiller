The EUR/USD currency pair saw a slight rise during Thursday's European trading session, edging closer to the 1.1800 level. This modest gain follows a period of weakness for the Euro, as the pair continues to face pressure from a stronger US Dollar. The exchange rate remains trapped in a broader downtrend, with the greenback's resilience preventing any significant upward momentum.

The firm USD is largely driven by expectations of a robust US economic recovery and potential interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. As a result, the Euro is struggling to gain ground, with key technical resistance levels capping any bullish movements. Traders are closely monitoring 1.1800 for potential signs of a breakout or further downside, as the broader outlook for the pair remains uncertain.

AUD/USD is stabilizing just below the 0.6700 mark, trading around 0.6680 during Wednesday's Asian session. After experiencing modest losses in the previous trading day, the currency pair is now awaiting critical economic indicators, particularly China's Trade Balance data, which could influence market sentiment and the exchange rate.

The Australian dollar remains under pressure as traders assess the potential impact of China's economic performance on demand for Australian exports. With the USD showing resilience against a basket of currencies, fluctuations in the AUD/USD exchange rate will likely continue as investors weigh both fundamental and technical factors in the lead-up to the trade data release.

The EUR/USD currency pair experienced a notable rebound during Monday's Asian trading session, climbing 0.35% to approximately 1.1680 after hitting a one-month low of 1.1620. This upward movement comes amid growing concerns regarding the Federal Reserve's independence, which may be influencing market sentiment and trading strategies.

This increase in the exchange rate signals a shift in investor confidence, as traders reassess the implications of potential changes in U.S. monetary policy. As the market reacts to developments surrounding the Fed, the dynamics between the euro and the dollar remain closely watched, with fluctuations in this currency pair likely to continue as geopolitical and economic factors evolve.

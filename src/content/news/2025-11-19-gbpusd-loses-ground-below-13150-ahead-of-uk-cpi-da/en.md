GBP/USD continues to lose momentum, trading around 1.3130 during the Asian session on Wednesday. This marks the fourth consecutive session of subdued performance for the currency pair, as traders remain cautious ahead of the release of key economic indicators. Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming UK Consumer Price Index (CPI), PPI Core Output, and Retail Price Index data for October, which could significantly influence the exchange rate.

The anticipation surrounding the UK inflation data has kept the GBP/USD exchange rate under pressure, as traders reassess their positions in light of potential economic implications. A weaker than expected CPI reading could further drag down the pound, while stronger figures might provide a much-needed boost. As the trading day progresses, market sentiment will likely hinge on these critical data releases, shaping the outlook for the British pound against the USD.

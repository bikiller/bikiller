Gold (XAU/USD) started the week with limited movement, trading in a tight range as investors remain cautious. The precious metal is caught in a consolidation phase, with mixed macroeconomic signals keeping traders hesitant to push prices higher. As of now, XAU/USD is hovering near $5,004, recovering from an intraday low of $4,965, down about 0.55% on the day.

The market is grappling with uncertainty as traders assess the Federal Reserve’s future policy stance alongside ongoing geopolitical risks. The outlook for the USD remains pivotal, as any shift in interest rate expectations could have a significant impact on gold’s exchange rate. For now, gold’s trading action is largely driven by a balancing act between these macroeconomic factors, with any clear direction yet to emerge.

The EUR/USD currency pair surged above the 1.1640 mark on Monday, gaining over 0.40% as traders moved away from the US Dollar. This shift in trading sentiment follows President Trump's decision to intensify the ongoing trade conflict between the US and the European Union, coinciding with the administration’s interest in Greenland. Currently, the exchange rate stands at 1.1642, having rebounded from a daily low of 1.1576.

Market participants are reacting to the deteriorating risk appetite, which has put pressure on the USD and bolstered the Euro. As the trade war escalates, the volatility in the foreign exchange market may continue, influencing investor strategies and positioning in upcoming sessions. The implications of these developments could lead to further fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate as the situation unfolds.

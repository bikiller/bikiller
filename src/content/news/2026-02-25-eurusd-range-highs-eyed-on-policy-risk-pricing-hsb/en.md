EUR/USD has remained stable despite ongoing uncertainty surrounding EU–US trade relations. HSBC Global Research notes that much of the US policy risk has already been priced into the exchange rate, leading to limited movement in the pair. The EUR/USD has been hovering within its recent range, with resistance near the upper levels, yet it has failed to break higher.

HSBC expects the currency pair to remain within its range in the short term, as the market continues to factor in US policy risks. Although there is no immediate catalyst to push EUR/USD beyond recent highs, the pair is likely to test the upper end of its current range. Traders should watch for any shifts in US economic policy that could affect the EUR/USD exchange rate moving forward.

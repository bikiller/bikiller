The Japanese Yen (JPY) has slipped to its lowest level against the US Dollar (USD) in over a week, as it trades around 147.50 in early European trading. This decline is primarily driven by rising domestic political uncertainty and persistent fiscal concerns, which have overshadowed the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish stance on monetary policy. 

As market participants digest these developments, the exchange rate dynamics suggest increased volatility for the JPY. While the BoJ's outlook may typically bolster the currency, the current climate indicates that fiscal issues are taking precedence, potentially leading to further depreciation if the situation remains unaddressed. The EUR/JPY pair also reflects this trend, highlighting the broader impact of Japan's internal challenges on its currency performance in the forex market.

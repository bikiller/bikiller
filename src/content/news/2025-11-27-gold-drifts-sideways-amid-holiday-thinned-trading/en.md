Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a period of sideways movement as trading remains light due to holiday factors. Currently, the precious metal is priced around $4,155, just below the two-week highs reached on Wednesday. The recent modest rebound in the US Dollar (USD) has exerted some downward pressure on gold prices, which have increased over 2% this week.

Market dynamics continue to be influenced by fluctuations in the USD, which may affect the exchange rate of XAU/USD in the near term. Traders are closely watching these developments, as the interplay between the dollar and gold prices could signal future trends in the precious metal market. As the week progresses, investor sentiment and any shifts in currency strength will be critical in determining gold's trajectory.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) retreated from a record high of nearly $4,550 during Monday's Asian trading session, as traders opted to lock in profits ahead of the upcoming holidays. This pullback reflects a broader market sentiment as participants capitalize on the recent bullish rally that pushed prices to unprecedented levels.

Additionally, a strengthening US Dollar (USD) is contributing to the downward pressure on gold. As the USD rises, it increases the cost of gold for buyers using other currencies, such as the euro (EUR), thus impacting demand. Investors will be closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics, as fluctuations in the USD could further influence gold prices in the near term.

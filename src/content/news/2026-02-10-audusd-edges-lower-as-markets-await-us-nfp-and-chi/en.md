AUD/USD trades slightly lower on Tuesday, snapping a two-day winning streak as the Australian Dollar eases under pressure from weaker domestic consumer sentiment. The currency pair drifts modestly but avoids a deeper pullback, with the exchange rate holding within recent ranges as traders remain cautious ahead of major macro catalysts.

The downside in AUD/USD is tempered by a broadly softer USD, which limits aggressive selling interest. In forex trading, this balance reflects a market reluctant to commit ahead of key risk events, particularly the upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls report and China’s CPI data, both of which carry significant implications for global growth and risk appetite.

Looking ahead, short-term direction in the currency pair is likely to remain data-driven. A strong US jobs report could lift the USD and weigh further on AUD/USD, while signals of improving Chinese inflation could support the Australian Dollar. Until then, trading conditions may stay range-bound, mirroring broader consolidation across major pairs such as EUR/USD.

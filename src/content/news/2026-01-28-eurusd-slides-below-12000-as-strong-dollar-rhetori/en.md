EUR/USD came under heavy selling pressure on Wednesday, sliding more than 0.70% and breaking below the key 1.2000 exchange rate level. The currency pair weakened as renewed support for a strong USD shifted sentiment, reversing earlier Dollar softness. The move marked a notable change in trading conditions after recent volatility driven by political commentary.

The catalyst came after US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed speculation about potential foreign exchange market intervention and reaffirmed the long-standing strong Dollar policy. His remarks helped stabilize the USD, offsetting earlier Greenback weakness triggered by comments from US President Donald Trump. As a result, the EUR/USD exchange rate fell sharply, with traders reassessing near-term USD positioning.

Looking ahead, attention is turning to the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, which could further influence USD demand and broader currency market direction. A firm stance from the Fed may reinforce the Dollar’s rebound, keeping pressure on the euro. From a technical perspective, sustained trading below 1.2000 could open the door for deeper EUR/USD losses in the near term.

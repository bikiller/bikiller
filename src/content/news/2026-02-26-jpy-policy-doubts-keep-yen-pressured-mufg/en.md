The Japanese Yen showed some recovery after USD/JPY briefly touched 156.82, pulling the currency pair back below the 156.00 mark. Despite this, MUFG's Lee Hardman highlights that the Bank of Japan's ongoing loose monetary policy continues to pressure the yen. The weaker stance from the BoJ contrasts with tightening policies from other central banks, particularly the Fed, contributing to the Yen's struggles.

As a result, the yen remains vulnerable to fluctuations in global risk sentiment and interest rate differentials. The loose policy from Japan is expected to keep the exchange rate pressured, despite any short-term pullbacks. Traders will be watching for signs of further BoJ actions, with USD/JPY likely to stay elevated unless a shift in policy stance occurs.

AUD/USD remains near its 16-month high, trading at 0.6920 during the Asian session on Tuesday. The pair reached a peak of 0.6940 in the previous trading session, marking its highest level since September 2021. The Aussie dollar has been supported by positive market sentiment, while the USD has remained under pressure due to ongoing concerns over U.S. economic conditions and Federal Reserve policy.

As traders look ahead, the upcoming release of the December Consumer Price Index (CPI) data on Wednesday will be crucial. The CPI figures are expected to provide further insight into inflation trends, which could influence the Reserve Bank of Australia’s (RBA) monetary policy decisions. The market remains cautious, awaiting further signals on whether the RBA will continue tightening or adjust its stance in the face of evolving economic conditions.

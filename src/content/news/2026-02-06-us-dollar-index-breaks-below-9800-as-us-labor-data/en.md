The US Dollar Index (DXY) slipped below the key 98.00 mark as US labor data revealed a cooling job market, pushing the index down to around 97.90 during the Asian trading session on Friday. After two consecutive days of gains, the DXY saw a notable pullback, driven by softer-than-expected employment figures, signaling potential weakness in the US economy.

The decline in the DXY was mirrored in the performance of major currency pairs, with the EUR/USD exchange rate showing a slight uptick. Traders are closely watching this development, as the weakening US dollar could signal shifts in global risk sentiment and affect the trading outlook for USD-based pairs. With the job market showing signs of deceleration, market participants are reassessing expectations for future interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

Gold (XAU/USD) continued its downward trend for the third consecutive day, reaching a one-week low around the $4,170 mark during the early European session on Tuesday. This decline reflects a negative bias in the market, influenced by shifting investor sentiment as traders weigh the potential implications of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.

Despite the recent dip, the downside for gold appears cushioned by ongoing bets on a rate cut, which may support demand for the precious metal. The interplay between gold prices and the USD remains crucial, as any shifts in monetary policy can significantly impact the exchange rate and traders' strategies in the forex market. As market participants monitor the situation closely, further fluctuations in the gold market are anticipated.

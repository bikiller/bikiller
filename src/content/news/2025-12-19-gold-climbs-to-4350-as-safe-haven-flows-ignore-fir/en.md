Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a notable increase during the North American session on Friday, rising 0.30% to trade at $4,344. This surge occurred despite upward pressure from the US Dollar and rising US Treasury bond yields, which are anticipated to end the week with a modest 0.25% gain. 

The precious metal bounced off daily lows of $4,309, driven by safe-haven flows as traders sought refuge amid market volatility. The resilience of gold against a strengthening USD highlights its enduring appeal in uncertain economic conditions, suggesting that investors remain cautious despite the dollar's firm position in the currency markets.

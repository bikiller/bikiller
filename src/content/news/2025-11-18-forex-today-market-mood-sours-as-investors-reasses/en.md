The market is now closely watching for any signals from upcoming Fed meetings that may clarify the central bank's stance on future rate hikes.

Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair fell to 1.2780, reflecting a 0.4% decline as concerns over the UK’s economic outlook weighed heavily. Traders are adjusting their positions amid uncertainty, influencing the broader forex landscape.

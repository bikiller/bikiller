The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to weaken against a stronger US Dollar (USD), with the USD/JPY currency pair reaching a fresh multi-month high during the Asian session on Thursday. The exchange rate has dropped to its lowest point since mid-February, reflecting sustained selling pressure on the Yen as traders respond to bullish sentiment surrounding the USD.

This persistent decline in the Yen can be attributed to a combination of factors, including the divergence in monetary policy between the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan. As the USD strengthens, driven by robust economic data and expectations of further interest rate hikes, the JPY struggles to find support. Market participants will be closely monitoring these trends, as the ongoing weakness in the Yen could have significant implications for Japan's economy and global trading dynamics.

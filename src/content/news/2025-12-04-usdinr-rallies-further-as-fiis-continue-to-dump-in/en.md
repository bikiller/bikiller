The Indian Rupee (INR) continued its downward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD), marking its seventh consecutive day of decline. The USD/INR currency pair opened at a record high of approximately 90.70 as persistent foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows from Indian equities exerted substantial pressure on the Rupee. 

This ongoing sell-off in the equity market has raised concerns among traders, contributing to the weakened exchange rate. The situation reflects a broader trend of foreign investors reallocating their assets, further impacting the INR's performance in the forex market. As the Rupee faces significant headwinds, market participants are closely monitoring developments that could influence future trading dynamics.

The New Zealand Dollar (NZD) experienced a pullback against the US Dollar (USD), retreating below the 0.5800 mark during Tuesday’s European session. After a brief recovery from the 0.5740 region, the NZD/USD currency pair struggled to maintain momentum and has since settled around the 0.5790 level as traders head into the US session.

Market sentiment, which initially leaned towards a risk-on approach during Monday’s US trading, has shifted, prompting caution among investors. The inability to sustain gains above the 0.5800 threshold indicates potential challenges for the Kiwi in the near term, as participants reassess their positions amid fluctuating economic indicators and geopolitical developments.

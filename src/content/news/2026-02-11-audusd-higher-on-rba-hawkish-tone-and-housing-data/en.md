The Australian Dollar (AUD) surged against the US Dollar (USD), climbing above 0.71 for the first time since February 2023. This upward momentum comes as markets factor in a 70% probability of a 25 basis point rate hike by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in May. The AUD/USD exchange rate continues to gain, reflecting investor confidence in the RBA's hawkish stance on monetary policy.

Positive housing data further supported the Aussie, adding to the market’s optimism about economic resilience. With the RBA potentially tightening policy, the Australian currency remains buoyant, as traders position themselves ahead of the central bank's next moves. The AUD/USD's advance suggests the market is preparing for more tightening, reinforcing the bullish outlook for the currency.

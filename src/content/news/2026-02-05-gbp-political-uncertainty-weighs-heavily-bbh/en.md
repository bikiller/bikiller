The British Pound has come under significant pressure amid growing political uncertainty surrounding Prime Minister Keir Starmer's leadership. GBP/USD dropped to a near 1.2100 level, reflecting a sharp decline in the currency. The latest developments have fueled concerns about the stability of the UK government, sending shockwaves through the forex market.

This political turbulence has also weighed heavily on the UK gilts market, contributing to the broader selloff in GBP. With the EUR/GBP trading close to 0.8600, the Pound is facing increasing challenges against the Euro. Traders are closely monitoring the situation as it could influence future monetary policy decisions and broader market sentiment toward UK assets.

The USD/JPY currency pair has climbed above the 155.50 mark, reaching approximately 155.60 in the early Asian trading session on Thursday. This upward movement reflects a broader strengthening of the US Dollar against the Japanese Yen, driven by cautious remarks from Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller. Traders are closely monitoring these developments as they anticipate the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release.

As the market digests Waller's statements, which suggest a careful approach to monetary policy, the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and JPY could lead to heightened volatility. The focus now shifts to the CPI data, as a stronger-than-expected reading could further bolster the dollar, while disappointing figures might temper the recent gains and impact overall trading sentiment in the currency markets.

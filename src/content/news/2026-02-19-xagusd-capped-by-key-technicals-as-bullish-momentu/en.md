Spot Silver (XAG/USD) is facing significant resistance from key technical levels as its bullish momentum stalls. The price has been capped around crucial support and resistance zones, limiting its upward potential. As trading continues into February's second half, traders are closely monitoring the market’s response to Fed funds rate expectations, which remain a pivotal factor influencing the metal’s movements.

The ebbing price action in XAG/USD is largely driven by uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy. With the USD's strength continuing to impact the silver market, shifts in the Fed's interest rate trajectory are likely to dictate future price trends. Market participants are increasingly sensitive to any signals from the Federal Reserve regarding rate hikes, making these expectations a dominant force for Spot Silver heading into the coming weeks.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices dipped to approximately $58.50 on Tuesday, reflecting a decline of 0.40% for the day. The drop in prices follows the announcement of a resumption of production at Iraq's West Qurna 2 field, which is expected to boost short-term supply in the market, exerting further downward pressure on oil values.

While the increase in Iraqi production weighs on prices, optimism surrounding potential Federal Reserve rate cuts is providing some support for oil markets. As traders monitor the balance between supply and demand, fluctuations in oil prices could also influence currency pairs such as USD/EUR, affecting broader market sentiments.

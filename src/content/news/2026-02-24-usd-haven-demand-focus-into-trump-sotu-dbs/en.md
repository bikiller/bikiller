Markets are turning their attention to President Trump's State of the Union Address (SOTU), with investors seeking safe-haven assets as uncertainty looms. The demand for the USD has increased as traders prepare for potential volatility. The EUR/USD exchange rate has experienced fluctuations, with the pair testing key support levels near 1.1050. 

The risk-off sentiment has bolstered the dollar, with many turning to the USD ahead of the speech. Analysts note that the outcome could influence the broader market, especially in currency pairs like USD/JPY, where trading has been more sensitive to risk sentiment. The USD’s performance may depend on the tone of the address, with investors weighing the potential for policy shifts.

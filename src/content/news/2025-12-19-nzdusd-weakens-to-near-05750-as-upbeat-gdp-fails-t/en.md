The NZD/USD currency pair is experiencing a decline, weakening to around 0.5760 during the early European trading hours on Friday. This movement comes despite strong GDP figures from New Zealand, highlighting renewed demand for the US Dollar (USD), which is exerting pressure on the Kiwi.

Traders are now closely monitoring upcoming data releases, including the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index and Consumer Inflation Expectations, set to be announced later today. These indicators could significantly influence market sentiment and trading decisions as participants assess their impact on the exchange rate and potential shifts in monetary policy.

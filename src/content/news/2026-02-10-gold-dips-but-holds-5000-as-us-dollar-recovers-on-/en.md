Gold prices dropped during Tuesday’s session as a weaker-than-expected U.S. economic report led investors to scale back their short positions on the US Dollar. Despite the pullback, the precious metal managed to hold above the crucial $5,000 level, with XAU/USD trading at $5,022, marking a loss of 0.72% on the day. 

The soft U.S. data, which dampened expectations of a strong economic recovery, allowed the USD to recover some ground. This shift in sentiment pressured gold lower, as traders adjusted their positions in reaction to the U.S. Dollar's strength. The market remains cautious, with XAU/USD's price hovering above significant technical support at the $5,000 threshold.

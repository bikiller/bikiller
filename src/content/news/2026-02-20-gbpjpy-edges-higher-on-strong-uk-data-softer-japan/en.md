GBP/JPY gained traction on Friday, climbing to 209.23 as the British Pound received a boost from stronger-than-expected UK economic data. The upbeat numbers supported market sentiment around the GBP, lifting the currency pair higher despite a generally range-bound environment. At the time of writing, GBP/JPY remained within a narrow range just above 209, indicating a lack of strong directional momentum.

Meanwhile, the Japanese Yen struggled as softer inflation data from Japan capped its gains. The country's Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures came in below expectations, weighing on JPY sentiment. The combination of solid UK data and muted inflation in Japan led to subdued trading conditions, with GBP/JPY consolidating just over a week-long technical range. Investors will be watching for any further developments that could influence the exchange rate in the near term.

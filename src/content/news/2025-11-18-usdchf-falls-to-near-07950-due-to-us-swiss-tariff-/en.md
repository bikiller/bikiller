The USD/CHF currency pair has seen a notable decline, trading around 0.7950 during Asian hours on Tuesday. This drop comes after the recent announcement of a tariff deal between the U.S. and Switzerland, prompting traders to reevaluate their positions. The exchange rate reflects a retracement from gains made in the previous session as market sentiment shifts.

Meanwhile, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has maintained its steady stance, contributing to the current market dynamics. The interplay between U.S. economic policies and Swiss monetary stability continues to influence trading strategies, underscoring the importance of developments in U.S.-Swiss relations for future movements in the USD/CHF exchange rate.

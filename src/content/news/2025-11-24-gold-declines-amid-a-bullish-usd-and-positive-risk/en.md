Gold (XAU/USD) faced fresh selling pressure during the Asian session on Monday, dipping below the $4,050 mark. This decline comes amid a bullish sentiment surrounding the USD, which has strengthened against major currencies, influencing traders' risk appetite. Despite the drop, the precious metal appears to lack significant follow-through, suggesting that downside potential may be limited in the short term.

The positive risk tone in the market continues to support the USD, leading to increased volatility in the gold market. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate movements as they assess the implications for both gold and the broader forex landscape. With the current dynamics, market participants remain cautious, weighing the prospects of further gold price fluctuations against a backdrop of a resilient dollar and shifting risk sentiment.

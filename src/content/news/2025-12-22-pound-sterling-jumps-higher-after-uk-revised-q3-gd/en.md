The Pound Sterling (GBP) surged 0.45% against its major currency counterparts, reaching approximately 1.3440 on Monday, propelled by the release of revised Q3 GDP data from the UK. This upward movement in the GBP reflects an optimistic market sentiment as traders react to the positive economic outlook indicated by the new figures.

As the Pound strengthens, the exchange rate dynamics impact major pairs, particularly against the USD and EUR. Market participants will closely monitor how the revisions influence future trading decisions and potential policy adjustments from the Bank of England. The robust performance of the GBP may signal increased investor confidence, leading to further volatility in the forex market.

The Indian Rupee (INR) showed resilience against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, breaking a three-day losing streak. The USD/INR pair retreated to approximately 90.35 as the US Dollar Index (DXY) experienced a significant drop, hitting a new three-week low of 98.86 on Monday. This shift in the exchange rate reflects an improved market sentiment, easing concerns that had previously pressured the INR.

The decline in the USD is attributed to a variety of factors, including a broad-based recovery in risk appetite among investors. As market mood lightens, currencies like the INR gain traction against the dollar. Traders will be closely monitoring further developments, particularly any changes in economic data or geopolitical events that could influence the currency pair's trajectory in the coming sessions.

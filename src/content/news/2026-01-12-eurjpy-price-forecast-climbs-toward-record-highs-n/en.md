EUR/JPY continues its upward momentum, reaching approximately 184.30 during the Asian trading session on Monday. This marks the second consecutive day of gains for the currency pair, as traders remain optimistic about its prospects. The current exchange rate places EUR/JPY close to record highs near the 185.00 mark, reflecting a robust demand for the euro against the yen.

Technical analysis indicates a 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 61, suggesting that the pair enjoys strong momentum without entering overbought territory. This positive sentiment in the forex market may be fueled by economic indicators from the Eurozone and expectations surrounding monetary policies, further supporting the euro's strength against the Japanese yen. As traders keep a close watch on these developments, the potential for the EUR/JPY to reach new heights remains in focus.

The EUR/USD currency pair faced downward pressure on Wednesday, reaching a fresh weekly low around 1.1740 during the Asian trading session. This decline underscores the pair's struggle to maintain upward momentum, particularly as it attempts to extend beyond the critical resistance level of 1.1800. Traders are closely monitoring this exchange rate, weighing factors that may influence the euro against the US dollar.

Market sentiment has been shaped by various economic indicators and geopolitical developments, contributing to fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate. The inability to hold above 1.1800 could signal a shift in momentum, prompting traders to reassess their strategies in response to evolving market conditions. As the trading day progresses, further volatility may be anticipated as participants respond to new data and insights impacting both currencies.

Silver (XAG/USD) surged to a historic high on Friday, surpassing the $100.00 mark to reach an all-time peak of $100.39 before pulling back slightly. The precious metal has been gaining momentum, driven by a daily rise of over 4%, bouncing off lows of $96.04 earlier in the session. This significant price action signals a strong bullish trend in the silver market.

The rally in silver comes amid broader market fluctuations, with investors seeking safe-haven assets in response to ongoing volatility in global markets. As XAG/USD continues to trade above the key $100 level, market participants are closely monitoring the potential for further gains. A continued upward trajectory could see silver challenge additional resistance levels, raising questions about the sustainability of this remarkable price movement in the face of shifting macroeconomic conditions.

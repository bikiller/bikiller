Pound Sterling opened the week on a firm footing, outperforming its major peers as trading began ahead of the Bank of England policy meeting. During the European session, the GBP/USD currency pair regained traction, supported by a modest pullback in the USD. The exchange rate found buying interest near 1.3660 before pushing slightly above the 1.3700 handle.

The advance reflects positioning ahead of a key central bank week, with traders reassessing relative policy paths across major currencies. A softer US Dollar helped lift Sterling, while broader forex trading remained cautious as investors balanced expectations for the BoE against developments affecting the USD and EUR. The Pound’s relative strength suggests growing confidence in near-term UK policy stability.

From a market perspective, the ability of GBP/USD to hold above the 1.3660 support level reinforces its short-term constructive tone. A sustained move above 1.3700 could encourage further bullish trading interest, while failure to maintain momentum may invite consolidation. With central bank signals in focus, the exchange rate remains sensitive to shifts in USD sentiment and broader risk appetite.

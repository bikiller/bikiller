The EUR/JPY currency pair is experiencing a pullback, as it dipped to around 184.35 during the early European session on Monday. This decline marks a loss of momentum for traders, who have recently been eyeing potential upward movements in the exchange rate. The first significant resistance level appears to be at 185.00, where sellers may step in to test the bullish trend.

Market participants are closely monitoring these price movements, as the implications of a breakthrough above 185.00 could signal further gains for the euro against the yen. Conversely, a failure to maintain momentum could lead to increased selling pressure, prompting traders to reassess their positions in this volatile pair. As the trading week progresses, fluctuations in economic data and geopolitical factors will likely play a critical role in shaping the EUR/JPY exchange rate.

Silver (XAG/USD) continued its impressive ascent, recording a 2.80% increase on Tuesday, pushing the price above $71 and nearing historic highs. This surge is largely driven by heightened safe-haven demand as investors seek stability amid global uncertainties and shifting economic conditions.

Market sentiment has shifted, with many traders placing bets on potential easing measures from the Federal Reserve. The growing anticipation of a more dovish monetary policy has further bolstered silver's appeal as a reliable store of value. As the exchange rate for silver approaches record levels, market participants will closely monitor both geopolitical developments and Federal Reserve commentary that could influence future trading dynamics.

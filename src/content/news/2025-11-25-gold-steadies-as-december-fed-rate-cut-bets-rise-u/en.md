Gold (XAU/USD) maintained its stability on Tuesday as traders adjusted their expectations for a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December. This shift comes in response to dovish remarks from Fed policymakers, which have led to increased bets on a softer monetary policy. The precious metal's resilience reflects growing uncertainties in the economic outlook.

As soft US economic data continues to emerge, the market's focus remains on the implications for the USD. Lower interest rates typically bolster gold's appeal as a non-yielding asset, prompting investors to consider the currency pair’s performance against the backdrop of changing monetary policy. Consequently, gold's exchange rate appears poised for further movement as traders monitor upcoming economic indicators and Fed communications.

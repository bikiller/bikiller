The Euro (EUR) struggled to maintain its post-European Central Bank (ECB) gains after the central bank's recent decision to keep interest rates unchanged. Despite an upbeat outlook and upgraded growth projections, the EUR/USD exchange rate retraced from recent highs, reflecting market skepticism about sustained strength. Analysts at Scotiabank pointed out that this may signal the end of the ECB’s easing cycle.

As trading continued, the EUR's inability to hold onto its gains suggests a cautious market sentiment. Investors are weighing the implications of the ECB's stance against ongoing economic uncertainties in Europe. The EUR/USD pair's fluctuations indicate a delicate balance, with traders now focusing on future ECB communications and economic indicators that could further influence the exchange rate dynamics.

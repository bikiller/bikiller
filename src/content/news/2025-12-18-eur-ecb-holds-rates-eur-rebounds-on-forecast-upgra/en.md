The European Central Bank (ECB) maintained its current interest rates, in line with market expectations. However, upward revisions to growth and inflation forecasts led to a rebound in the euro, reversing previous declines. As a result, the EUR/USD exchange rate showed resilience, highlighting the market's reaction to the ECB's outlook on the economy.

Despite the positive revisions, speculation surrounding potential rate hikes in late 2026 remains cautious. Traders are weighing the implications of these updates, which could influence future trading strategies. With the EUR gaining strength, market participants are closely monitoring how these forecasts may affect the euro's performance against the USD in the coming weeks.

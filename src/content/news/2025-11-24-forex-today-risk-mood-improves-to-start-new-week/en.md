The forex market opened the week on a positive note, as risk sentiment improved among traders. The EUR/USD exchange rate edged higher, reaching 1.0850, reflecting a 0.2% increase. Meanwhile, the USD/JPY currency pair experienced upward momentum, trading at 110.25, bolstered by gains in global equities and a softer tone in the US dollar. 

Analysts attribute this shift in sentiment to easing concerns over global economic growth, following positive developments in various regions. The market's focus is now on upcoming economic data releases, which could further influence trading strategies. With the continued strength of the euro and a resilient yen, traders are closely monitoring technical levels for potential breakout opportunities.

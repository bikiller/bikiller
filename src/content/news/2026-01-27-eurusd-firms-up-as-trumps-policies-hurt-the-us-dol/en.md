The EUR/USD currency pair has rebounded from earlier losses, gaining strength on Tuesday to reach 1.1800, reversing a downward trend. This movement places the euro near its four-month high of 1.1907, showcasing its resilience against the US dollar. 

The strengthening of the euro comes amid continued pressure on the USD, fueled by market concerns over President Trump's policies. These developments have created a shift in investor sentiment, weighing on the US dollar and pushing the EUR/USD exchange rate higher.

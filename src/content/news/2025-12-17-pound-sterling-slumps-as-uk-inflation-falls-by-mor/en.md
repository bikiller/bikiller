The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced significant selling pressure on Wednesday, dropping over 0.5% to around 1.3340 against the US Dollar (USD). This decline follows the release of the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November, which showed inflation falling sharply to 3.2%, exceeding market expectations. The weaker inflation figure has led traders to reassess the Bank of England's monetary policy outlook.

As the GBP weakens against the USD, other currency pairs are also affected, with the EUR/GBP exchange rate likely to fluctuate as market participants react to the news. The overall sentiment in the forex market is cautious, with traders closely monitoring further economic data and central bank signals. This shift in the value of the Pound highlights the ongoing volatility in the currency markets amid changing inflation dynamics.

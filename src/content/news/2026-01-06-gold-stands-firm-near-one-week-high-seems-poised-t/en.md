Gold (XAU/USD) has maintained its position near a one-week high, trading modestly higher in the early European session at approximately $4,465. This slight gain reflects market optimism, with traders eyeing potential further appreciation as geopolitical tensions and inflation concerns continue to underpin demand for the safe-haven asset.

The current exchange rate indicates a robust resilience in gold prices, with technical levels suggesting that further upward movement is possible if buying interest persists. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators and central bank policies, particularly within the USD and EUR zones, as these factors could significantly influence gold's trajectory in the coming sessions.

AUD/USD is trading flat around 0.6550 on Monday, showing little movement as traders process a mix of US economic data. This divergence in data has created uncertainty in the market, prompting investors to adopt a cautious approach. The lack of volatility in this currency pair reflects the broader hesitance among traders to make significant moves ahead of upcoming Australian economic reports.

As focus shifts to Australia’s Q3 GDP figures, market participants are keen to assess how the economic landscape might impact the exchange rate. With the Australian dollar currently holding steady against the USD, any deviations in the GDP data could lead to increased trading activity. The interplay between US data and Australian economic indicators will be crucial in shaping market sentiment in the coming days.

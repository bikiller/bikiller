TD Securities strategists predict a gradual decline for the USD/CNY exchange rate, expecting it to trend towards 6.7. They anticipate that Chinese authorities will keep volatility low throughout the 2026 Two Sessions, maintaining stability in the currency market. This controlled approach aims to prevent sharp fluctuations in the USD/CNY pair, offering a steady trading environment for market participants.

Despite the expected decline, Chinese authorities are not expected to resist the strengthening of the Yuan. This indicates that the authorities may allow the CNY to appreciate within a manageable range, promoting stability while signaling confidence in the Chinese economy. Traders will likely monitor the USD/CNY exchange rate closely for any signs of shifts in government policy during the upcoming political sessions.

The Euro has maintained strength against the USD, supported by a shift in hedging strategies, according to BNY’s EMEA Macro Strategist, Geoff Yu. However, the European Central Bank (ECB) decision in February has capped further EUR/USD gains. The ECB’s current stance indicates that it is comfortable with the prevailing exchange rate, setting a high threshold for any reaction to currency fluctuations.

With the EUR/USD trading range-bound in recent weeks, market participants anticipate limited movement unless there is a significant change in economic data. The ECB's reluctance to adjust its guidance further strengthens the Euro’s resilience in the face of potential USD strength, signaling that traders may continue to hold Euro positions with minimal adjustments in the near term.

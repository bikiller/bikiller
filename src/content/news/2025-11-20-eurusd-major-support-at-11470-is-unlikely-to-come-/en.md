The EUR/USD currency pair is currently positioned to test the resistance level at 1.1500, with analysts from UOB Group suggesting that the major support at 1.1470 is unlikely to be threatened in the near term. Despite this temporary stability, there is a growing concern among traders regarding a potential downward bias for the euro in the longer run.

UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, caution that while the exchange rate may initially hold above 1.1470, it is premature to determine if it can maintain this level consistently. Market movements suggest that traders should remain vigilant, as fluctuations in the EUR/USD pair could signal broader trends influenced by economic data and geopolitical factors affecting both the Eurozone and the United States.

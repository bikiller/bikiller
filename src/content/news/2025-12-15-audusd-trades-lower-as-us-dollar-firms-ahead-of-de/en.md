The AUD/USD currency pair is facing downward pressure as the Australian Dollar (AUD) declines against a firmer US Dollar (USD). Currently trading at 0.6637, the pair has struggled for a third consecutive day. This movement reflects a broader trend, with the USD gaining strength ahead of a significant economic release from the US, specifically the delayed Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data set to be announced on Tuesday.

Market sentiment remains cautious as traders position themselves ahead of the heavy US economic docket. The potential implications of the NFP data could further influence the exchange rate of AUD/USD, with expectations that a strong report may bolster the USD even more. This scenario indicates ongoing volatility in the forex market, particularly for those trading in the AUD/USD pair, as shifts in economic indicators can lead to rapid changes in currency valuations.

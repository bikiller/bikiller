The EUR/GBP currency pair continues to trade under pressure, with the exchange rate hovering near the 0.8650 support area after extending a bearish trend that has been in place since mid-November. Selling interest returned earlier this week when the Euro failed to sustain a move above the 0.8700 level, reinforcing downside momentum in recent trading sessions.

Market participants remain cautious as technical indicators suggest limited upside for the Euro against the Pound. The inability to reclaim 0.8700 has kept the EUR/GBP pair pinned lower, while repeated tests of the 0.8650 zone highlight its importance as a near-term support. Broader currency market dynamics, including USD movements and shifting risk sentiment, continue to influence EUR and GBP positioning.

If the 0.8650 support gives way, traders may look for further downside as the bearish structure remains intact. Conversely, a clear rebound would require a decisive break above 0.8700 to ease selling pressure. For now, the exchange rate reflects a market focused on short-term technical levels, with cautious trading dominating the EUR/GBP outlook.

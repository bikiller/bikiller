Gold (XAU/USD) continues to exhibit a bullish trend, maintaining intraday gains as the European session unfolds. Trading just below its all-time peak reached earlier today, the precious metal benefits from heightened safe-haven demand, driven by former President Trump's renewed tariff threats. This geopolitical uncertainty has prompted traders to seek refuge in gold, bolstering its appeal against a backdrop of fluctuating equity markets.

As the market responds to these developments, gold's performance reflects broader trends in the currency markets, with the exchange rate against the USD remaining favorable for investors. The ongoing volatility in the forex landscape, particularly between major pairs like EUR/USD, further underscores gold's status as a sought-after asset. Traders are closely monitoring these dynamics, as the implications of tariff discussions could influence both commodity prices and currency valuations in the coming days.

The EUR/USD currency pair continues its upward momentum for a second consecutive day, reaching the 1.1830 zone during the Asian session on Thursday. This marks a notable recovery, with the pair benefiting from broad market sentiment and a slight pullback in USD strength. Traders are focusing on potential resistance around the 100-SMA on the H4 chart, which may cap further gains.

The exchange rate faces key technical resistance near the 1.1830 level, where the 100-SMA could trigger selling pressure. A sustained break above this region could open the door for further bullish movement, potentially targeting higher levels. Market participants will be watching closely for any shifts in sentiment or data releases that could influence the USD's direction.

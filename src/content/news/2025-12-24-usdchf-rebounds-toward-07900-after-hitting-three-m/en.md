During the Asian trading session on Wednesday, the exchange rate settled around 0.7880, marking a continuation of its downward trend for the third consecutive session. 

Market dynamics are influencing this movement as traders assess the strength of the U.S. dollar in relation to the Swiss franc. With the USD facing pressure, fluctuations in economic indicators and geopolitical developments could further impact the trading behavior of this pair, potentially leading to increased volatility in the coming sessions.

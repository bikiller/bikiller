USD/CAD is trading at approximately 1.3880 on Tuesday, showing little movement as the market grapples with mixed macroeconomic signals from the United States and supportive factors for the Canadian Dollar stemming from oil prices. The stability in the exchange rate reflects a balance between disinflationary pressures in the US and the influence of rising oil prices on the Canadian economy.

Despite fluctuations in oil, the US dollar's resilience is evident as it continues to resist downward pressure from disinflation. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as they could have significant implications for future currency pair movements. The current trading range suggests that investors are awaiting clearer signals from both economies before making decisive moves.

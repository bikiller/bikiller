Weaker-than-expected Japanese GDP data for Q4 has dampened recent Yen strength, leading to a rebound in the USD/JPY currency pair. The exchange rate surged above the 153.00 level after briefly dipping to 152.27, reflecting a reversal of the Yen's earlier gains. The slowdown in Japan's economic growth weighed on investor sentiment, contributing to a softening of the Yen.

As USD/JPY recovers, market focus shifts to the broader implications of Japan’s economic performance. With the exchange rate now back above 153.00, traders are closely watching for any further signs of weakness in Japan's recovery. The USD continues to gain traction as investors adjust their expectations for global growth, while the Yen remains vulnerable to further volatility in response to economic data.

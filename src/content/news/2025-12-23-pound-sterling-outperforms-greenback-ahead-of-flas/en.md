The Pound Sterling (GBP) surged against the US Dollar (USD) during European trading hours on Tuesday, approaching a notable 12-week high near the 1.3500 mark. This upward momentum comes as traders await the flash US Q3 GDP data, which could significantly influence market sentiment and the USD's performance.

As the GBP/USD currency pair strengthens, expectations around the upcoming economic indicators are driving speculation in the forex market. Should the GDP data fall short of forecasts, the USD may face further depreciation, allowing the GBP to capitalize on its current bullish trend. This movement highlights the ongoing volatility in currency exchange rates as investors closely monitor economic releases.

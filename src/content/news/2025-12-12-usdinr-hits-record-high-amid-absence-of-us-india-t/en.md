The Indian Rupee (INR) has experienced a significant downturn against the US Dollar (USD), with the USD/INR currency pair reaching a record exchange rate of 90.86 on Friday. This movement is attributed to the ongoing absence of a trade deal between the United States and India, which has raised concerns about the stability of the INR in the current trading environment.

As traders react to the lack of progress on trade negotiations, the weakening of the Rupee reflects broader market sentiments and economic uncertainties. The INR's decline against the USD could have notable implications for import costs and inflation in India, potentially impacting consumer prices and economic growth. Market participants will be closely monitoring any developments regarding trade relations that could influence future fluctuations in this pivotal currency pair.

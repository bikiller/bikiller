Silver (XAG/USD) saw a bounce back after hitting a fresh weekly low at $48.64 but remains under pressure, currently trading at approximately $49.69. Despite this modest recovery, the precious metal is down nearly 1.50% on the day, positioning it for a weekly decline. The market appears to be experiencing fatigue, indicated by a potential double-top formation.

The broader uptrend in silver prices has not yet been broken, but traders should remain cautious as the currency pair navigates through this volatile phase. The ongoing fluctuations may impact trading strategies, especially as investors monitor possible shifts in the exchange rate dynamics influenced by broader economic factors. The trading sentiment around silver continues to oscillate, reflecting a complex interplay with the USD and global market conditions.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) has maintained its upward momentum against major currencies, buoyed by the positive market reaction to the UK budget announced on November 26. As of Thursday, GBP/USD is trading near 1.3900, reflecting an increase of approximately 0.5% since yesterday. This rally has boosted investor confidence, leading to a stronger exchange rate for the pound against the euro as well, with the GBP/EUR pair hovering around 1.1700.

Analysts suggest that the UK budget's relief measures have played a crucial role in enhancing market sentiment, resulting in increased demand for GBP. This has not only influenced trading strategies across currency pairs but has also raised expectations of further economic recovery in the UK. With the current exchange rates, traders are closely monitoring the pound's performance to gauge potential trading opportunities as the market reacts to ongoing fiscal policies.

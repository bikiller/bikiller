The EUR/JPY currency pair has strengthened, trading near 180.90 in the early European session on Monday. The Japanese Yen has weakened against the Euro, influenced by a disappointing revised Gross Domestic Product (GDP) report for Japan. This economic data has led traders to adjust their positions, contributing to the upward movement in the exchange rate.

Bullish technical signals are also supporting the EUR/JPY advance, with the pair approaching the crucial 181.00 level. As market participants continue to digest the implications of Japan's economic performance, the outlook for further gains in the Euro against the Yen remains optimistic. Traders will be closely monitoring any developments that could affect the strength of the Euro or the Yen in the coming sessions.

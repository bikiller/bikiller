Silver (XAG/USD) posted a 2.5% gain on Friday, bouncing from daily lows around $74. The price of silver surged after a softer-than-expected US inflation report, reaching $77.20 per ounce ahead of the weekend. Despite this uptick, silver is on track to close the week lower, highlighting ongoing struggles below the critical $80.00 resistance level.

The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation cooling more than anticipated, which weakened the USD and supported precious metals. However, silver remains constrained by technical resistance, unable to push past $80.00. Traders will be watching closely for further signs of inflationary trends and potential shifts in the broader market sentiment as the new week approaches.

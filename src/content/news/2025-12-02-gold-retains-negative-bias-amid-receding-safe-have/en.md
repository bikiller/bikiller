Gold (XAU/USD) continued to exhibit a negative bias in the first half of the European session on Tuesday, reflecting a decline in safe-haven demand among traders. Despite this downward pressure, the precious metal has remained resilient, successfully holding above the crucial $4,200 level.

The stability around $4,200 could be pivotal, influencing trading strategies as investors weigh the implications of ongoing economic developments and shifts in the USD exchange rate.

The USD/INR currency pair continued to gain momentum on Tuesday, marking the fourth consecutive day of losses for the Indian Rupee (INR) against the US Dollar (USD). This rally has been fueled by persistent foreign outflows, contributing to the rupee’s downward trajectory. Traders noted that the exchange rate has been pressured as investors remain cautious in light of global economic uncertainties.

Additionally, India's Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) showed signs of cooling, further impacting market sentiment. A decline in manufacturing activity may have heightened concerns over economic growth, prompting investors to seek safety in the USD. As the INR struggles to maintain its footing, analysts will be closely monitoring foreign investment trends and upcoming economic indicators to gauge the currency's performance in the coming sessions.

GBP/USD surged on Wednesday following the Federal Reserve's anticipated rate cut, which was decided by a 9-3 vote. While two members advocated for maintaining the current rates, Fed Governor Stephen Miran pushed for a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction. As a result, the currency pair rose to an exchange rate of 1.3350, marking a 0.46% increase.

Traders are now closely monitoring Fed Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming statements for indications of future monetary policy shifts. The market's focus on potential further easing could continue to impact the USD's strength against the GBP and other currencies. With the Fed's decision driving market sentiment, the dynamics of the GBP/USD pair may experience heightened volatility in the near term.

The USD/JPY currency pair has climbed to approximately 156.00 during the European trading session on Thursday, reflecting a notable rise in the US Dollar. This upward movement comes as traders anticipate the release of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November, scheduled for 13:30 GMT. A stronger USD suggests heightened expectations for inflation.

As market participants brace for the CPI report, the implications of rising inflation could prompt further speculation regarding interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve. The robust performance of the USD against the Japanese Yen indicates increasing investor confidence in the US economy, which could influence trading strategies in the forex market leading up to the data release.

USD/CAD extended its gains on Tuesday, trading around 1.3676, as the Canadian Dollar (CAD) faced pressure from softer-than-expected inflation data. The weaker-than-anticipated headline inflation figures pointed to easing price pressures in Canada, reinforcing market expectations of slower rate hikes by the Bank of Canada. This contributed to the ongoing decline in CAD against the US Dollar (USD).

The US Dollar's strength added to the pressure on the CAD, with the greenback buoyed by solid economic data and hawkish sentiment in US markets. The USD has been benefitting from expectations of tighter monetary policy, which has supported its continued strength. As a result, USD/CAD has seen a fifth consecutive day of gains, highlighting the divergence between the two currencies' economic outlooks.

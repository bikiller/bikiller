Silver prices experienced a slight retreat during the late North American session on Wednesday, with the XAG/USD trading at $58.49, down 0.14%. This pullback occurred despite a weakening US Dollar, fueled by economic data that reinforced market expectations of an upcoming Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. 

Technical indicators also suggest underlying caution, as RSI divergence points to potential corrective risks in the silver market. Traders are closely monitoring the interplay between the USD's movements and silver prices, with the upcoming Fed decision likely to influence the exchange rate dynamics in the days ahead.

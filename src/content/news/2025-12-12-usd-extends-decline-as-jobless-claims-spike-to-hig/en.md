The US Dollar (USD) has extended its decline as initial jobless claims surged to 236,000, marking the largest weekly increase since March 2020. This rise highlights ongoing weakness in the labor market, which has pressured the currency in recent trading sessions. Analysts from OCBC, Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, emphasize that this data point has contributed to a bearish sentiment around the USD, impacting its performance against major currency pairs.

As traders adjust their positions, the EUR/USD exchange rate benefits from the dollar's weakness, with the euro gaining traction. The increased uncertainty surrounding the labor market could lead to further volatility in the forex market, as investors reassess their outlook on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. The implications of this data could be significant, suggesting potential shifts in trading strategies as market participants navigate the evolving economic landscape.

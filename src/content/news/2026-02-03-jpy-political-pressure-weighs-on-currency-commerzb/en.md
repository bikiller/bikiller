The Japanese Yen continues to face downward pressure, with the USD/JPY exchange rate trading at 155.50. Political statements and verbal interventions concerning the Yen's weakness have failed to produce tangible market action, contributing to the ongoing depreciation. The lack of concrete follow-through has left traders skeptical, keeping the currency pair vulnerable to further losses.

Despite Japan's attempts to address the weakening Yen, the absence of clear policy responses has left the market in uncertainty. With USD/JPY holding near the 155.50 level, the pair remains susceptible to additional volatility. The political backdrop, combined with weak intervention signals, suggests that the Yen could face more challenges unless more decisive measures are taken.

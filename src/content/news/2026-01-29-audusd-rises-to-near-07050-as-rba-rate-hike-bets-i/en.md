AUD/USD extended its advance for a third straight session, trading around 0.7040 during Asian hours on Thursday and edging closer to the 0.7050 region. The currency pair’s exchange rate reflects steady demand for the Australian Dollar against the USD, as traders adjust positions ahead of shifting monetary policy expectations.

Rising bets on further RBA rate hikes continue to underpin AUD/USD trading, lifting the pair toward recent highs near 0.7050. Expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia may maintain a tighter stance have supported the Australian Dollar, even as broader FX markets remain sensitive to moves in the USD and global risk sentiment.

The recent upside suggests improving momentum for AUD/USD, with a sustained break above the 0.7050 area potentially opening room for further gains. However, traders remain cautious as the US Dollar’s direction, alongside developments in major pairs such as EUR/USD, could influence near-term price action across the forex market.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) have retreated from their record high of $4,526 during Wednesday's Asian trading hours as traders engaged in profit-taking. This pullback comes amid a backdrop of strong economic data from the US, particularly the upbeat Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures, which have contributed to a more robust outlook for the USD.

As traders reassess their positions, the recent gains in the currency pair highlight the delicate balance between risk appetite and economic fundamentals. The positive GDP data may weigh on gold's appeal as a safe haven, potentially leading to further fluctuations in the exchange rate as market participants adjust their strategies in response to evolving economic indicators.

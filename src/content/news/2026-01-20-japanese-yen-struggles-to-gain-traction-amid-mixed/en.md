The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling to maintain momentum despite modest gains during the Asian trading session, particularly against a weakening US Dollar (USD). As traders look ahead to the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) upcoming policy decision, uncertainty in the domestic political landscape is causing hesitance among bulls to make aggressive moves. The current exchange rate for USD/JPY hovers around 110.50, reflecting a cautious trading environment.

Meanwhile, the broader currency market is experiencing mixed signals, with the Euro (EUR) also facing challenges. The EUR/JPY pair is trading sideways as traders weigh the potential impact of the BoJ’s policies on future currency movements. With the USD weakened by recent economic data, the lack of a clear bullish trend in JPY suggests that traders remain on the sidelines, awaiting more definitive guidance from central bank announcements.

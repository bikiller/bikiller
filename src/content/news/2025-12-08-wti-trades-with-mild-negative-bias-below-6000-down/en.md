West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices are currently trading with a slight negative bias, hovering just below the $60.00 mark. Despite a three-week uptrend, WTI has been unable to maintain momentum, oscillating within a narrow range during the Asian trading session on Monday. This stagnation suggests limited downside potential in the near term, as traders closely monitor market sentiment.

The constrained price action reflects broader concerns in the energy market, influenced by fluctuating demand forecasts and geopolitical factors. As WTI prices remain sensitive to changes in the U.S. dollar's exchange rate, fluctuations in currency pairs such as USD/EUR may further impact oil trading dynamics. Investors are advised to pay attention to upcoming economic indicators that could sway market movements in the crude oil sector.

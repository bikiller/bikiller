The Eurozone economy saw a 0.3% quarter-on-quarter growth in Q4 2025, according to Eurostat's second estimate, confirming the preliminary figure. This steady growth underpins the resilience of the region's economic recovery, with key sectors maintaining momentum despite global challenges. The positive data had a moderate impact on EUR/USD, pushing the pair slightly higher, as investors reacted to the stronger-than-expected economic performance.

As the Eurozone navigates persistent inflationary pressures and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties, the GDP expansion suggests underlying strength in the economy. Traders will be closely monitoring how this affects the European Central Bank's policy stance. A more hawkish outlook could support the EUR further, potentially driving the EUR/USD exchange rate toward resistance levels around 1.1050, should economic conditions continue to improve.

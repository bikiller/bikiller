The GBP/USD rally has paused ahead of the upcoming Bank of England (BOE) meeting, with the currency pair trading within a narrow range. According to DBS Bank's Group Research, authored by Philip Wee, the market expects the exchange rate to maintain a dovish bias. The focus now shifts to the BOE's stance on monetary policy, which could set the tone for future GBP movement.

With the current trading sentiment subdued, traders are cautious as they await any signals from the BOE. The technical outlook suggests GBP/USD will continue to hover within its established range unless any significant shifts in market expectations or economic data emerge. The price action reflects the broader uncertainty in global forex markets, with the USD remaining strong against major currencies like the EUR.

AUD/USD ended the latest trading session at 0.6916, signaling a pause in its recent upward momentum as the currency pair enters a consolidation phase. According to UOB Group, the exchange rate is expected to trade within a defined range of 0.6880 to 0.6940 in the near term. This sideways movement reflects balanced market positioning between the Australian dollar and the USD.

While short-term trading may remain range-bound, analysts note that underlying momentum still leans mildly constructive. Any renewed strength in the AUD/USD currency pair would require a decisive break above the 0.6945 resistance level. Such a move would indicate stronger bullish conviction in forex markets and open the way for a potential advance toward the next technical objective at 0.6985.

Broader currency market dynamics, including USD performance against peers like EUR/USD, continue to influence sentiment. Shifts in global risk appetite, interest rate expectations, and macroeconomic data remain key drivers for forex trading. For now, traders are likely to adopt a cautious stance, monitoring technical levels closely while awaiting clearer directional signals in the exchange rate.

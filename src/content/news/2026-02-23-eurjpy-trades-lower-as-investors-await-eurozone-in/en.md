EUR/JPY is trading lower at 182.50, down 0.15% on the day, as investors adopt a cautious stance ahead of key economic data from the Eurozone and Japan. The currency pair’s movement reflects market uncertainty as traders await inflation figures from Europe and any potential signals on the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy stance.

Market participants are closely monitoring these macroeconomic releases for direction. Any surprises in the Eurozone's inflation report could affect the EUR/USD exchange rate, while expectations surrounding the BoJ's upcoming rate decisions could drive further volatility in the JPY. Traders are positioning themselves for potential shifts in sentiment as the data unfolds.

EUR/USD has extended its losses for a fourth consecutive day, currently trading at approximately 1.1760 after peaking just above 1.1800 last week. The pair's decline reflects a firming US Dollar as market sentiment deteriorates, driven by uncertainties surrounding the recent Trump-Zelenskyy meeting. Investors are reassessing potential implications for future economic policies.

In addition to this political backdrop, escalating tensions between China and Taiwan are contributing to heightened volatility in the currency markets. The strengthening USD indicates a shift in investor focus toward safe-haven assets amid these geopolitical concerns, influencing the exchange rate dynamics of major currency pairs, including EUR/USD.

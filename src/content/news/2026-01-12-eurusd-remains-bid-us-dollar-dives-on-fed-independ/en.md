EUR/USD is currently trading at 1.1690, reflecting a 0.4% increase on the day as the currency pair rebounds from recent one-month lows around 1.1620. This upward movement follows concerns over Federal Reserve independence, which has led to a significant decline in the US Dollar.

The market's reaction indicates a growing apprehension among investors regarding the Fed's ability to maintain its autonomy, prompting a shift in sentiment that favors the euro. As traders recalibrate their positions, the exchange rate's rise could signal a potential strengthening of the EUR against the USD, depending on future economic data and Federal Reserve policy decisions.

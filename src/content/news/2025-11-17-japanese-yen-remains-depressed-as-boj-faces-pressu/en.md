The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to struggle against the US Dollar (USD), remaining under pressure amid expectations that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) will delay any potential interest rate hikes following disappointing GDP figures. The JPY/USD exchange rate shows the Yen trading at a nine-month low, reflecting ongoing market sentiment that is skewed towards a stronger USD.

As traders react to the latest economic data, the Yen's weakness has been exacerbated by a broader uptick in the USD, which is buoyed by robust economic indicators. Analysts anticipate that unless the BoJ signals a shift in its monetary policy stance, the JPY could face further declines, complicating trading strategies for those engaged with the JPY against other major currencies like the Euro (EUR).

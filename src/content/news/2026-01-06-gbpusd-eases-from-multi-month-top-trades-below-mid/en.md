The GBP/USD currency pair experienced a slight pullback during Tuesday's Asian session, trading below the mid-1.3500s after hitting a multi-month high of 1.3545-1.3550. This level marked its strongest point since September 2025, reflecting a robust upward trend in the previous day’s trading.

The recent decline in the exchange rate can be attributed to a modest uptick in the USD, which has influenced market dynamics. As traders reassess their positions, the movement raises questions about the sustainability of the GBP's advance against the dollar, particularly as economic indicators continue to shape the forex landscape.

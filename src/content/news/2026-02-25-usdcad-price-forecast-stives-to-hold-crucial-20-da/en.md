The USD/CAD currency pair is experiencing a slight decline of 0.16%, trading near 1.3675 in early European hours on Wednesday. The pair is facing pressure as the US Dollar weakens following President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, which had a limited impact on market sentiment. Despite this, the USD remains supported by broader economic factors.

The exchange rate is attempting to hold above the crucial 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), a key technical level for traders. A failure to sustain this level could signal further weakness for the USD/CAD pair, with potential downside risks. Traders will be closely watching for any shifts in sentiment following the speech and any upcoming economic data.

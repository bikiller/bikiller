The EUR/USD currency pair extended its losses on Tuesday, continuing the downtrend for a second consecutive day. The Euro (EUR) reversed previous gains, trading lower against the US Dollar (USD) following disappointing economic sentiment figures from the Eurozone. The exchange rate has dropped as market participants reacted to weaker-than-expected data, which weighed on the Euro's strength.

At the time of writing, the EUR/USD pair is trading near 1.0700, a key support level that could determine further price action. Analysts are closely monitoring the Eurozone's economic outlook, with investors cautious amid the ongoing uncertainty. As the pair continues to face downward pressure, the US Dollar remains supported by strong demand, creating a challenging environment for the Euro in the short term.

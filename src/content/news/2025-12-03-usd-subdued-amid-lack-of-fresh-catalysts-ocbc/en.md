The US Dollar (USD) experienced a subdued trading session, lacking fresh catalysts to drive movement in the currency markets. The Dollar Index (DXY) was last seen at 99.19, reflecting a cautious sentiment among traders as the impact of major central bank decisions seems largely priced in. This stagnation may limit volatility in key currency pairs, particularly against the EUR and GBP.

Analysts at OCBC, Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, highlight that the prevailing market conditions suggest a wait-and-see approach among investors. With most central banks having made their decisions, attention will likely shift to upcoming economic data releases that could influence the USD's exchange rate and trading dynamics in the near future.

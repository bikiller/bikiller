Gold surged to a three-week high on Monday as rising uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and growing tensions with Iran sparked increased demand for safe-haven assets. At the time of writing, XAU/USD was trading around $1,515, marking a nearly 1.0% gain on the day. The heightened geopolitical risks added pressure on global markets, driving investors to seek refuge in gold.

The renewed volatility in global markets, driven by potential US tariffs and the escalating US-Iran standoff, weighed heavily on the US Dollar (USD). As a result, the XAU/USD exchange rate saw significant upward movement, benefiting from the dollar's weakening. This shift highlights the ongoing flight to safety, with traders turning to gold amidst the global uncertainties, further boosting its appeal as a store of value.

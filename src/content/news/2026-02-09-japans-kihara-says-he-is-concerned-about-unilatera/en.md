Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary, Minoru Kihara, expressed concerns over recent one-sided movements in the foreign exchange market, signaling potential instability. He warned that rapid, unilateral changes in exchange rates could disrupt economic conditions. These remarks come amid heightened volatility in currency pairs like USD/JPY, where the Japanese yen has seen significant fluctuations. 

In response, Japan’s top currency diplomat, Atsushi Mimura, emphasized the government’s vigilance, stating he would closely monitor the market with urgency. With the yen's recent weakness against the dollar and other major currencies, Japan’s authorities are closely watching trading patterns, especially as USD/JPY hovers near key technical levels. The government’s heightened focus on the FX market suggests potential intervention if trends continue, aiming to protect Japan’s economic stability.

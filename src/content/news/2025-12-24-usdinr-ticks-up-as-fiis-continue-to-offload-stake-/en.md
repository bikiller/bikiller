The Indian Rupee (INR) is experiencing a slight decline against the US Dollar (USD) as early trading unfolds on Wednesday, with the USD/INR currency pair rising to approximately 90.16. This uptick follows a period of corrective movement after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened in the forex market last week. 

The latest market dynamics are largely influenced by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continuing to offload their stakes in the Indian stock market. This trend adds downward pressure on the INR, reflecting broader market sentiment and potential concerns over capital flows, which could impact the exchange rate further in the near term.

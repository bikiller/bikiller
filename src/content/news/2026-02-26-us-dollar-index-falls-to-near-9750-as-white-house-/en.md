The US Dollar Index (DXY), a gauge of the USD’s value against six major currencies, is experiencing a second consecutive day of losses. Trading around 97.50 during Asian hours on Thursday, the index faces continued pressure amid lingering doubts surrounding White House policies. The index’s decline reflects weakening sentiment toward the US currency as traders await further clarity on government actions.

The US dollar’s struggles have impacted key currency pairs, including EUR/USD, which has shown signs of strength. With the DXY near 97.50, the market remains cautious about the USD's near-term outlook. The continued uncertainty over US domestic policy could fuel volatility in upcoming trading sessions, influencing exchange rates across global markets.

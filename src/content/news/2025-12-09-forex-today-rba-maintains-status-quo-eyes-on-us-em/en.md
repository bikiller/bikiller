The Australian Dollar (AUD) remained stable on Tuesday as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) opted to maintain its current monetary policy, keeping interest rates at 4.10%. This decision reflects the central bank's cautious stance amid ongoing inflationary pressures. AUD/USD traded around 0.6640, while the exchange rate for AUD/EUR held steady near 0.6150, indicating muted market reaction.

Traders’ focus is now shifting towards upcoming U.S. employment data, which is expected to significantly influence the USD exchange rates. Analysts anticipate a solid Non-Farm Payrolls report, with expectations set for an increase of around 200,000 jobs. The EUR/USD pair hovered around 1.0650, as market participants remain vigilant for any shifts in sentiment that could arise from the employment figures and their implications for future Federal Reserve policy.

Gold prices in India saw a decline on Friday, as reported by FXStreet data. The precious metal's drop came amid a stronger US Dollar, which gained traction against major currency pairs. Gold trading was impacted by the US dollar’s strengthening in the forex market, with the USD/INR pair showing noticeable movement. Gold prices fell by approximately 0.5%, reflecting the pressure from a firmer dollar and ongoing global market volatility.

The weaker gold outlook may persist if the USD continues to hold an upward trajectory. Market participants are keeping an eye on key resistance levels for the EUR/USD and USD/INR exchange rates. As the USD gains dominance, traders expect further fluctuations in the gold market, which could influence future price actions in both the Indian and global gold markets. Investors are advised to monitor the next support levels closely for potential buying opportunities.

The EUR/JPY currency pair surged to new record highs, trading above 185.55 on Thursday, driven by a weakening Yen. The Euro found support from the softening Japanese currency, enabling it to reverse losses from Wednesday and reach a fresh peak of 185.75 during the European trading session.

The movement came ahead of the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) key policy decision, as traders anticipated potential shifts in monetary policy. The Yen's decline allowed the Euro to strengthen further, highlighting the ongoing impact of central bank policies on exchange rate dynamics.

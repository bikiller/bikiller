EUR/USD is trading just below the 1.1750 mark, hovering around 1.1740 during the Asian session on Friday, following a 0.5% gain in the previous session. The currency pair remains constrained by the upper boundary of a descending channel, with resistance near the 1.1750 level. Traders are closely watching this range for potential breakouts or continued consolidation.

The recent pullback in EUR/USD suggests hesitation in further upside momentum, as the pair faces headwinds from the strengthening US dollar. Market participants will be looking for a clear break of either the channel’s upper limit or a downside shift towards lower levels to determine the next move in the exchange rate. Volatility may increase as traders react to upcoming economic data and market sentiment.

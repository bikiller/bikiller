Gold (XAU/USD) is currently consolidating gains after a significant rally of over 2.5% on Monday, following heightened safe-haven demand prompted by the recent U.S. attacks on Venezuela. As of now, the XAU/USD currency pair is trading around $4,460, slightly retreating from an intraday high near $4,475.

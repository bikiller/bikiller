The Swiss National Bank (SNB) will announce its final monetary policy decision of 2025 today at 08:30 GMT. Market participants are keenly anticipating any changes that could influence the USD/CHF exchange rate. Currently, analysts are closely watching levels around 0.90, as shifts in interest rates could result in significant volatility for this currency pair.

A rate hike could strengthen the Swiss franc against the US dollar, potentially pushing the USD/CHF lower. Conversely, if the SNB maintains its current stance or signals a dovish outlook, the franc may weaken, allowing the USD to gain ground. Traders should remain alert to the implications of the SNB's decision on broader market dynamics, particularly in relation to the euro as well.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) is holding steady against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, with the AUD/USD currency pair trading near the 0.7000 mark. The pair has remained flat as traders await the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, set to be announced at 19:00 GMT. 

The USD has gained some support in anticipation of the Fed's upcoming move, influencing the broader market sentiment. As the Fed prepares to deliver its decision, market participants are cautious, keeping the AUD/USD exchange rate range-bound ahead of any potential shifts. The outcome of this decision will likely dictate further momentum in the currency pair, especially regarding the Fed's stance on future rate hikes.

The USD/JPY currency pair reversed its gains on Monday, ending a six-day winning streak as the US Dollar faced broad-based selling pressure. The Yen strengthened following the results of Japan’s election, with USD/JPY dropping to 132.50, reflecting a 0.5% loss. The Greenback's weakness contributed to a broader trend of Yen appreciation, as market participants reacted to political developments in Japan.

The Yen's firm bid across the market was supported by Japan’s political landscape, while the weakening US Dollar reflected global risk sentiment. The USD/JPY pair is now testing key support levels, and traders are closely watching for any further developments in both US economic data and Japanese political stability. The exchange rate's shift signals a potential pause in the Dollar's recent rally.

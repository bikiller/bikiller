The GBP/USD currency pair is holding steady around the 1.3475 mark as traders exercise caution ahead of the critical US Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. After recovering from a three-week low near 1.3390, the pair has edged higher for the second consecutive day, reflecting a slight increase of nearly 0.10% on Tuesday. 

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming CPI data, which could significantly impact the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar. Uncertainty surrounding inflation figures is contributing to the hesitant trading atmosphere, as investors weigh potential implications for future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve.

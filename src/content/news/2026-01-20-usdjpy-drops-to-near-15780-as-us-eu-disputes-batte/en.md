The USD/JPY currency pair has fallen 0.2%, trading close to the 157.80 level during the European session on Tuesday. This decline reflects a broader weakness in the US Dollar (USD), which is struggling against major currencies. The recent tensions between the United States and the European Union regarding Greenland's sovereignty have contributed to this underperformance.

As the exchange rate shifts, market participants are closely monitoring the implications of these geopolitical disputes. The ongoing friction between the US and the EU may lead to increased volatility in the forex market, impacting both the USD and other currencies, including the Euro (EUR). Traders will likely adjust their strategies in response to further developments in these discussions.

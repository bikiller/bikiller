The Euro (EUR) faced pressure against the Japanese Yen (JPY) on Thursday, with the EUR/JPY exchange rate reflecting a notable decline. The European Central Bank (ECB) opted to maintain interest rates, which did not provide the anticipated support for the Euro. Instead, the Yen maintained its strength, bolstered by increasing speculation around a potential rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) set for Friday.

Traders are closely monitoring the BoJ's upcoming decision, as expectations of tighter monetary policy could further enhance the Yen's appeal. As the market adjusts to the ECB’s stance and the looming BoJ meeting, the EUR/JPY pair is likely to experience increased volatility. With the current trading dynamics, the currency pair's movement could signal shifts in investor sentiment towards both the Eurozone and Japan's economic outlook.

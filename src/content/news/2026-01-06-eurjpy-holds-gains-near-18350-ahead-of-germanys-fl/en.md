EUR/JPY has recovered slightly, trading around 183.40 during Tuesday's Asian session after facing two consecutive days of losses. The currency pair is now poised to hold gains near the 183.50 level as traders await key economic indicators from Germany, particularly the HCOB Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data.

This upcoming data release is crucial for market participants as it can influence the euro's performance against the yen and potentially affect the broader exchange rate landscape. As traders digest the implications of the PMI figures, fluctuations in the EUR/JPY pair could set the tone for further trading sessions, emphasizing the interconnectedness of economic indicators and forex market movements.

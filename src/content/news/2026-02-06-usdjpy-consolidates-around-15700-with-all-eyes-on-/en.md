USD/JPY continues consolidating near the 157.00 exchange rate as the US Dollar holds firm in forex trading, while the Japanese Yen remains the weakest major currency for a second straight week. The currency pair has hovered near multi-week lows for the yen, with the JPY down more than 1% recently and tracking its largest weekly drop since October amid pre-election positioning.

Political uncertainty tied to Japan’s upcoming election is a key driver of market sentiment. Hedge funds andtitutional traders have rebuilt short-yen positions, expecting continued currency pressure as policy and fiscal outlook risks grow. Officials have acknowledged both the benefits and risks of a weak exchange rate, while intervention speculation continues to cap aggressive USD/JPY upside moves.

> Hedge funds are reviving bets against the yen, positioning for renewed weakness as Japan heads into a pivotal election this weekend.


From a technical perspective, the 156.5–157.0 zone acts as a near-term pivot, with resistance clustered around 157.8–158.0 and stronger barriers toward 158.8–160.0. On the downside, support remains dense near 155.7–155.0. Fundamentally, wide yield differentials between the USD and JPY and ongoing carry-trade demand continue supporting the bullish USD/JPY trading structure.

WTI crude oil prices have edged higher to $65.60 during the Asian session on Thursday, reflecting rising market tension ahead of anticipated US-Iran negotiations. The commodity is benefiting from geopolitical risks, which have traders cautious about potential supply disruptions. As the USD strengthens against its counterparts, including the EUR, the energy market is closely monitoring developments in the region, which could further affect trading dynamics.

The ongoing US-Iran talks add uncertainty to the global oil market, keeping traders on edge. While the current WTI price represents a modest uptick, any shifts in diplomatic relations could lead to significant volatility in the energy sector. As the USD remains resilient, the outlook for WTI and other commodities is contingent on the resolution of these tensions, influencing broader forex market movements.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) remained under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, trading in a narrow range as it approached seven-month lows. The CAD struggled to gain traction due to declining crude oil prices, a key driver of the Canadian economy, which dampened investor sentiment. The exchange rate for the CAD/USD pair hovered around 1.3650, reflecting a cautious market atmosphere.

As traders anticipated crucial economic data releases later in the week, the CAD's defensive posture was evident. Market participants are closely observing how the upcoming reports may influence trading dynamics, particularly with the potential for further fluctuations in oil prices. The overall uncertainty in the market suggests that the CAD may continue to face challenges, maintaining its position as a vulnerable currency against the stronger USD.

GBP/USD is holding steady for a second consecutive session, currently trading around 1.3430 in the Asian trading hours on Thursday. The currency pair is closely approaching the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) barrier near 1.3450, which could serve as a critical resistance point. 

The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) sits at 51, indicating a neutral momentum after retreating from previous overbought conditions. This balanced momentum suggests that traders are cautiously monitoring the exchange rate for potential breakout opportunities, as both buyers and sellers appear to be weighing their options in the current market environment.

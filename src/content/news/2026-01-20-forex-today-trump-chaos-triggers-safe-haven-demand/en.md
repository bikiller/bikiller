Safe-haven currencies surged on Tuesday as tensions escalated between US President Donald Trump and European leaders, particularly concerning Greenland. The heightened uncertainty prompted traders to flock to safer investments, driving up the demand for the Japanese yen (JPY) and Swiss franc (CHF). As a result, the USD/JPY currency pair fell to 106.50, while CHF gains pushed the USD/CHF exchange rate down to 0.9100.

The Euro (EUR) also experienced fluctuations amid the turmoil, with the EUR/USD pair trading at 1.1850 after a brief dip earlier in the session. Market sentiment remains fragile, with geopolitical concerns overshadowing potential economic recovery signals. Analysts suggest that ongoing political discord could keep safe-haven demand strong, impacting future trading strategies for currency pairs as investors seek refuge from volatility in the markets.

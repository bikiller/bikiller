The Japanese Yen saw a modest gain against the US Dollar on Tuesday as the USD/JPY currency pair faced resistance near the 153.75 level during the Asian session. The pair struggled to maintain the momentum from the previous day's positive movement, attracting sellers at the technical resistance zone. As a result, the exchange rate failed to break higher, reflecting a lack of bullish conviction in the market.

The market's cautious sentiment stems from the ongoing policy divergence between the Bank of Japan (BoJ) and the Federal Reserve. While the Fed's tightening stance supports the USD, the BoJ maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy, keeping the Yen under pressure. The struggle at the 153.75 resistance could signal a potential consolidation phase unless stronger catalysts emerge to shift market sentiment.

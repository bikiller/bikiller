The US Dollar Index (DXY) has seen a notable decline, trading around the 99.00 mark during the Asian session on Monday, effectively breaking its four-day winning streak. This movement comes amid growing uncertainties surrounding the Federal Reserve's policy direction and ongoing discussions about potential rate cuts, which have weighed on the dollar's strength against other major currencies.

As the DXY fluctuates near this key psychological level, traders are closely monitoring the implications for currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY.

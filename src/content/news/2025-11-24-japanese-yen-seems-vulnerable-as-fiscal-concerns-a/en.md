The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to face pressure during the Asian session, trading at 137.25 against the US Dollar (USD). Investors remain cautious amid concerns regarding Japan's fiscal health, exacerbated by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s pro-stimulus policies. This stance raises fears about sustained economic growth and potential inflation, which could further weaken the currency.

The uncertainty surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy adds to the Yen's vulnerability. As the market anticipates potential shifts in interest rates, the JPY's exchange rate against major currencies like the Euro (EUR) remains unstable. With key technical levels under scrutiny, traders are closely monitoring developments that could impact the Yen's trajectory in the coming days.

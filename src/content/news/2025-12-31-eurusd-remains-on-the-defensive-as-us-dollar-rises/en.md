EUR/USD continued its downward trend on Wednesday, marking the sixth consecutive day of losses as it slipped below the 1.1730 level. Last week, the currency pair had briefly surged above 1.1800 but has struggled to maintain momentum. The recent decline comes amid a moderate rebound in the US Dollar (USD), spurred by the release of the December minutes from the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Meeting.

The USD's strength has put pressure on the euro, leading to a shift in trading dynamics for the EUR/USD exchange rate. As market participants digest the implications of the Fed's policy insights, further fluctuations may be anticipated. The currency pair's performance in the coming sessions will likely hinge on ongoing economic data and developments in US monetary policy, which could influence investor sentiment and trading strategies.

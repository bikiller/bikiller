At the February policy meeting, the European Central Bank (ECB) held interest rates steady, maintaining the main refinancing rate at 4.00%. ECB President Christine Lagarde addressed the decision, citing ongoing economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures. She emphasized the need for a cautious approach, with the ECB ready to act if conditions change. This move left the EUR/USD exchange rate trading near 1.0750, with little immediate market reaction.

The decision comes as inflation in the Eurozone remains persistently high, prompting speculation about future rate hikes. The EUR/USD pair's trading momentum has been subdued, consolidating in the 1.0700-1.0800 range. Lagarde's comments suggested that the ECB remains data-dependent, and traders are closely watching inflation indicators and economic growth to assess the likelihood of further tightening. The Euro continues to be sensitive to these developments, as the market weighs potential shifts in the ECB's policy stance.

Oil prices faced downward pressure as geopolitical developments influenced market sentiment. ICE Brent crude settled approximately 2.1% lower, reflecting heightened concerns surrounding ongoing Russia-Ukraine peace talks. This shift in market dynamics led to a ripple effect on currency pairs, with the USD gaining ground against the EUR as traders sought safe-haven assets amid the uncertainty.

The decline in oil prices may have broader implications for energy-related trading as fluctuations could impact exchange rates. Investors are closely monitoring these developments, which could influence central bank policies and economic forecasts in major economies. As the situation evolves, traders will need to stay vigilant to potential impacts on both commodities and currency markets.

Silver prices (XAG/USD) saw a notable rebound on Friday, recovering from a sharp drop earlier in the week. During the Asian trading session, silver climbed back above the $76.50 mark, reaching around $76.60. This recovery followed a steep decline of over 11% late Thursday, when XAG/USD experienced significant selling pressure. The drop was largely attributed to market volatility and shifting investor sentiment.

The market now turns its focus to the upcoming US CPI data, with analysts expecting the inflation report to influence the direction of both silver and broader market sentiment. A stronger-than-expected CPI could boost the USD, potentially putting further pressure on the precious metals market. As traders position themselves ahead of this key data release, silver remains sensitive to broader market trends, with the $76.50 level acting as a key support point in the near term.

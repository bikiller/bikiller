Gold (XAU/USD) surged to $5,005 during the early Asian session on Thursday, marking a significant rebound after a volatile period. The price movement comes as traders react to rising tensions between the US and Iran, which has led to increased demand for safe-haven assets. This rally reflects broader market uncertainty, with investors seeking stability in the precious metal amid geopolitical risks.

The ongoing US-Iran conflict continues to weigh on global sentiment, providing further support for gold as a safe-haven currency. Meanwhile, market participants are also closely watching upcoming US economic data, which could influence the broader demand for risk-sensitive assets. With the precious metal maintaining its upward momentum, gold’s performance is poised to remain sensitive to both geopolitical developments and shifts in global economic indicators.

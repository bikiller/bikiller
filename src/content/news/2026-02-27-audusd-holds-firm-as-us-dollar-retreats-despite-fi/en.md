The Australian Dollar (AUD) remained resilient against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, holding steady around 0.7112, as the Greenback retraced its earlier gains. Despite a stronger-than-expected US Producer Price Index (PPI) report, which typically signals inflationary pressures, the USD struggled to maintain momentum, allowing the AUD to sustain its upward trend. 

This price action keeps AUD/USD on track for its eighth consecutive week of gains, reflecting ongoing bullish sentiment. The currency pair's ability to maintain these levels, even in the face of robust US economic data, underscores the strength of the Australian Dollar. As traders digest the latest US inflation numbers, the exchange rate could remain supported if the Greenback fails to recover.

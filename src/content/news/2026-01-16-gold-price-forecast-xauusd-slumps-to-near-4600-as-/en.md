Gold prices (XAU/USD) fell sharply to around $4,605 during the early Asian session on Friday, reflecting a broader strengthening of the US Dollar. The decline comes on the heels of positive US Initial Jobless Claims data, which has contributed to a more bullish outlook for the greenback. Traders are closely monitoring the market as they await the release of the US December Industrial Production report later today.

The softer tone from former President Trump regarding Iran may also be influencing market sentiment, as geopolitical tensions often impact safe-haven assets like gold. As the exchange rate shifts, traders will be looking for signs of further movements in both the gold market and the USD, particularly in light of upcoming economic data that could affect future trading strategies.

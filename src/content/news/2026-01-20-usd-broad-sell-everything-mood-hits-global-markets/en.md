Global financial markets are experiencing significant turmoil, highlighted by a pronounced sell-off in US assets. The dollar is extending its losses as traders react to President Trump's renewed tariff threats and remarks about Greenland, creating a pervasive 'sell everything' sentiment. The USD has seen a notable decline against major currencies, with the EUR/USD exchange rate climbing to 1.1200, reflecting a robust move in favor of the euro.

This sharp downturn in the USD not only pressures the currency pair but also affects broader market dynamics, as investors shift their focus to safer assets amid rising geopolitical tensions. Bond yields are also under strain, adding to the sell-off's momentum. As the Davos summit approaches, traders are likely to remain cautious, keeping a close watch on further developments that could influence trading strategies and market stability.

The Euro (EUR) is currently trading softly as it consolidates within its recent range against the US Dollar (USD). According to Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, the EUR/USD exchange rate hovers just above the lows observed on Friday and Monday, indicating a period of indecision in the market.

This lack of momentum may reflect broader market sentiments and uncertainties impacting the Eurozone’s economic outlook. Traders are closely monitoring these technical levels as any significant break below could signal further weakness for the Euro, while a rebound could instigate renewed bullish sentiment in the currency pair.

Gold (XAU/USD) saw a slight pullback on Wednesday, retreating from the $5,300 mark following the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates. The Fed's stance, signaling a stable labor market, reinforces the view that higher rates will persist for a longer period. This hawkish hold by the central bank continues to influence investor sentiment, with gold struggling to gain momentum.

The Fed's cautious approach to rate hikes has kept the U.S. dollar (USD) supported, affecting gold's price movement. As the labor market remains resilient, traders are adjusting their positions, factoring in the possibility of prolonged higher rates. The price of XAU/USD now faces key support levels as the market digests the Fed's tone, with analysts eyeing further developments in U.S. economic data for fresh trading signals.

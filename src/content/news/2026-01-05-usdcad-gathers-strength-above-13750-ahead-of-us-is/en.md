The USD/CAD currency pair is bolstering its position above the 1.3750 mark, trading close to 1.3770 during the early European session on Monday. This movement reflects a modest strength in the US Dollar, which has been buoyed by recent economic indicators. However, the rising crude oil prices, primarily driven by geopolitical shifts, could pose a challenge for the USD as the commodity-linked Canadian Dollar (Loonie) gains traction.

The recent capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has led to increased volatility in oil markets, potentially supporting the Loonie in the near term. As traders eye the upcoming US ISM Manufacturing PMI report, the currency pair's movements may hinge on the data released, influencing overall market sentiment and exchange rates. The interplay between oil prices and the USD/CAD exchange rate will be crucial in the coming sessions as market participants assess potential trading opportunities.

The Indian Rupee (INR) remains under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday afternoon, with the USD/INR currency pair holding steady near the 91.20 mark. Despite some volatility in global markets, the INR continues to struggle as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) show weak interest in the Indian stock market. This lack of foreign capital inflow is a significant factor weighing on the Rupee’s performance.

The INR’s ongoing weakness is also influenced by broader market conditions. With global demand for emerging market assets subdued, the INR faces additional challenges in maintaining stability. As the USD/INR remains above key technical levels, traders will be closely watching for any shifts in foreign investment trends or broader market sentiment to gauge future movements.

EUR/CAD remains steady around 1.6130 as of Thursday, holding its ground with minimal movement. The currency pair is largely unaffected by the European Central Bank's decision to maintain interest rates, leaving traders focused on other factors influencing the market. With the ECB's stance, the euro holds its position, while the Canadian dollar faces pressure from broader commodity market dynamics.

Weak oil prices are weighing heavily on the Canadian dollar, a key driver for the currency due to Canada's reliance on oil exports. This pressure comes as crude struggles to gain traction, creating headwinds for the loonie. As EUR/CAD hovers around key technical levels, traders are watching closely for any developments that might tilt the balance between the euro and the Canadian dollar in the coming sessions.

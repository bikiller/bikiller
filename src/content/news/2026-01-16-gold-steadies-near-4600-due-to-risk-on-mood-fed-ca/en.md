Gold (XAU/USD) traded near $4,600 during early European hours on Friday, reflecting a steady performance amid shifting market sentiments. The precious metal experienced a downturn as safe-haven demand waned, driven by a decrease in geopolitical tensions related to Iran. US President Donald Trump indicated a potential delay in military action as Iran reassured that it would not execute protesters, contributing to a more risk-on mood in the markets.

The easing of concerns surrounding geopolitical risks has impacted the gold market, leading to fluctuations in its price. As traders adjust their positions, the exchange rate for gold remains susceptible to broader market dynamics, including the actions of the Federal Reserve and economic indicators in the US. With the current price around $4,600, investors are closely monitoring developments that could influence future trading activity, particularly any shifts in Fed policy that might affect the strength of the USD against other currencies.

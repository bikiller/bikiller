Gold (XAU/USD) continues its range-bound trading, showing a consolidative price action during the Asian session on Tuesday. The precious metal remains within a familiar range, reflecting a lack of directional momentum as traders exercise caution ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) rate decision. This indecisiveness has caused XAU/USD to hover around key technical levels, keeping the exchange rate steady.

As the market awaits the FOMC announcement on Wednesday, participants are taking a step back, resulting in subdued trading activity. The uncertainty surrounding potential monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve has left traders reluctant to commit to significant positions. This pre-meeting apprehension is likely to keep gold's price action confined until clearer signals emerge from the FOMC's decision, affecting broader market sentiments towards the USD and other currency pairs.

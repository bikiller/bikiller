EUR/USD remains under pressure as political risks in the Eurozone weigh on the currency’s outlook. Deutsche Bank analysts highlighted recent tightening of sovereign spreads, with Italian BTP and French OAT yields dropping to multi-month lows. Despite these moves, 10-year Bund yields held steady, suggesting a cautious approach from the market as it navigates ongoing uncertainty within the Euro Area.

The EUR/USD exchange rate faces challenges amid the tightening of peripheral Eurozone bonds, signaling a potential shift in investor sentiment. As Italian and French government bond yields fall, concerns about political instability within the region persist, contributing to a weaker euro. Market participants will closely monitor developments, especially as the USD strengthens, with the currency pair continuing to react to both Eurozone political dynamics and global economic conditions.

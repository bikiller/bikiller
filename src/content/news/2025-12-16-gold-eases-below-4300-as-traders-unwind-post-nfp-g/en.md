Gold (XAU/USD) has slipped below the $4,300 mark as traders reassess their positions following the latest U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, which revealed signs of weakness in the labor market. The currency pair peaked at $4,335 earlier in the trading session but subsequently experienced a decline of 0.23%, now trading at $4,296.

The market's response reflects a broader sentiment as traders unwind their post-NFP gains, impacting the exchange rate of the yellow metal. As gold's price fluctuates amidst these developments, investors are closely monitoring further economic indicators that could influence future trading strategies and the direction of the USD.

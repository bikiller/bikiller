The USD/CHF currency pair saw a rebound during the Asian session on Monday, recovering from an initial gap down. After opening lower, the exchange rate surged to around 0.7770 as the US Dollar strengthened. The upward movement was driven by renewed market concerns following US President Trump's renewed tariff threats, which spurred demand for the dollar as a safe haven.

The USD's gains also came amid broader concerns about global trade tensions, with traders reacting to Trump's comments on tariffs. As a result, the USD/CHF exchange rate moved closer to the key technical level of 0.7800. Market participants are closely watching this level, as a sustained break above could signal further bullish momentum for the US Dollar against the Swiss Franc.

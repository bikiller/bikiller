AUD/JPY is trading in negative territory at 111.15 during the early European session on Thursday. The Japanese Yen (JPY) has gained strength against the Australian Dollar (AUD) after hawkish statements from Bank of Japan (BoJ) officials, which have heightened expectations of tighter monetary policy. As a result, the currency pair is edging closer to the 111.00 support level.

Despite the short-term pullback, AUD/JPY remains above its 100-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), maintaining bullish momentum. The key technical support around 111.00 will likely be tested in the coming hours, and traders will be closely monitoring further BoJ commentary and any shifts in market sentiment for clearer direction. A breach below this level could signal deeper losses for the Australian Dollar against the Yen.

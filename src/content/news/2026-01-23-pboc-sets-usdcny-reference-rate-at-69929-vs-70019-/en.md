The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) set the USD/CNY reference rate at 6.9929 for Friday's trading session, a slight decline from the previous day's fix of 7.0019. This marks a notable shift in the exchange rate after a period of stabilization. The PBOC's move indicates an effort to control the yuan's movements, as the market continues to weigh factors like global economic trends and domestic policies.

Traders had expected a central rate closer to 6.9481, according to a Reuters estimate, reflecting a more stable outlook for the currency pair. The adjustment in the PBOC's setting suggests that the central bank is maintaining a cautious approach amid concerns over inflation and external economic pressures. As the yuan fluctuates around these levels, market participants will continue to monitor for further signals from the PBOC on its stance regarding currency stability.

The GBP/USD exchange rate remains under pressure as UK CPI data for January showed a stronger-than-expected outcome. Core and services inflation exceeded forecasts, pointing to persistent inflationary pressures, despite an overall trend of disinflation. The market is now debating the likelihood of a Bank of England rate cut in March, with inflation dynamics continuing to influence trading sentiment.

The surprise uptick in services inflation has led traders to reassess expectations for future monetary policy. Despite the overall cooling in price growth, the resilience of service sector inflation suggests that the BoE may hold off on aggressive rate cuts, which could keep GBP in a narrow range against the USD. The upcoming months will be crucial for gauging further market reactions.

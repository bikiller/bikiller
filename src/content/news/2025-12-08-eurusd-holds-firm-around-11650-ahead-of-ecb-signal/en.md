EUR/USD remains stable around the 1.1650 level as traders digest comments from ECB board member Isabel Schnabel, who expressed confidence in the market's anticipation of a potential future rate hike. This stability reflects a broader sentiment in the forex market, where investors are weighing the implications of evolving monetary policies in the Eurozone against the backdrop of a resilient USD.

The exchange rate's firmness signals that traders are positioning themselves for potential shifts in interest rates, which could influence the euro's strength. With the ECB signaling a willingness to embrace tighter monetary conditions, the currency pair may experience increased volatility as the market reacts to forthcoming economic data and central bank announcements.

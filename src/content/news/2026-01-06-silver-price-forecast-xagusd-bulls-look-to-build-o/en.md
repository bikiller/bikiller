Silver (XAG/USD) continues to gain momentum, building on its previous day's positive performance. The currency pair recorded a solid follow-through on Tuesday, indicating bullish sentiment among traders. Currently, XAG/USD is testing the key psychological level of $79.00, suggesting that if the bulls maintain their strength, further gains could be on the horizon.

The upward movement in silver prices can be attributed to a combination of factors, including a weaker USD and increased demand for safe-haven assets amid ongoing market uncertainties. As traders closely monitor the exchange rate and potential resistance levels, any decisive break above $79.00 could open up new trading opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on silver’s bullish trend.

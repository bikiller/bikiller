China's yuan continues to show strength, supported by policy-driven factors, even after the US-China tariff truce. According to DBS strategist Philip Wee, the USD/CNY has broken below the key 7.00 level, with the exchange rate now trading firmer within its designated band. This suggests ongoing efforts from Chinese authorities to stabilize and strengthen the yuan amidst global economic uncertainties.

The strengthening of the CNY comes as part of China's broader strategy to enhance its global economic role. With the yuan holding steady below the critical 7.00 mark, market participants are closely monitoring the currency pair's movements. This shift could have wider implications for the USD and other major currencies, as the CNY’s rise may influence global trade flows and investment sentiment in emerging markets.

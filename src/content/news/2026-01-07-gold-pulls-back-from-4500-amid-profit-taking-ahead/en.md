Gold (XAU/USD) is experiencing a pullback from the $4,500 level amid profit-taking, following a robust week of trading. After reaching a one-week high during the Asian session on Wednesday, the precious metal has struggled to maintain momentum as traders cash in on recent gains. This rejection at the psychological $4,500 mark indicates cautious sentiment ahead of significant macroeconomic data from the U.S.

As market participants await key economic indicators, the exchange rate of gold faces uncertainty, potentially impacting its appeal against the USD. Analysts note that any fluctuations in U.S. economic performance could influence future trading strategies, affecting the dynamics of the gold market in the coming days. The interplay between profit-taking and macroeconomic data will be crucial for determining gold's trajectory in this volatile trading environment.

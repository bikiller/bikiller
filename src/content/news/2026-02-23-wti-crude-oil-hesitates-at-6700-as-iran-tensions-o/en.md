WTI Crude Oil has been struggling to gain momentum this week, holding steady around $67.00 per barrel. Tensions surrounding Iran are providing support, while concerns over tariffs and global trade slowdowns are capping any significant advances. These mixed factors are keeping traders cautious, with the commodity largely unaffected by broader market trends like fluctuations in the USD/EUR exchange rate or economic data from major economies.

As the market navigates this uncertainty, technical levels suggest that WTI Crude may face further resistance near $68.00, while support holds at $66.00. With geopolitical risks in the Middle East continuing to simmer, traders are keeping a close eye on developments that could shift the balance. Crude prices remain vulnerable to external shocks, and any movement in USD pairs or global oil supply could trigger volatile price swings.

The GBP/USD exchange rate has risen by 0.2%, extending its recent rally, which is being fueled by positive market sentiment and stronger-than-expected economic data. This ongoing momentum reflects investor confidence, with the currency pair continuing to benefit from the UK's robust economic performance. As trading persists, the pound’s strength against the USD is adding to the pressure on broader market dynamics.

Market attention is now shifting to the upcoming Bank of England (BoE) policy decision, with most traders anticipating no significant changes to interest rates. The BoE’s stance will likely have an immediate impact on GBP trading, as investors look for clues on future monetary policy. With the GBP/USD trading higher, traders are eyeing key resistance levels as potential breakouts could further extend the rally.

The US Dollar (USD) is continuing its decline against the Swiss Franc (CHF), with the USD/CHF pair showing a consistent downtrend since the November 2025 high of 0.8102. The daily chart highlights a series of lower highs and lower lows, indicating sustained weakness in the greenback. Traders are closely monitoring the movement as the currency pair nears key technical support levels, signaling potential further losses for the USD.

As the Swiss Franc seeks the next leg of its strength, the USD/CHF exchange rate is testing critical levels that could determine the near-term direction. A sustained break below recent lows may open the door for further downside, with market participants focusing on economic data and central bank actions to gauge the Swiss Franc's momentum. With the USD struggling, attention turns to whether the current technical pattern will hold or lead to a reversal.

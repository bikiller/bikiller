The Statistics Bureau of Japan will release the Tokyo Consumer Price Index (CPI) for February on Friday at 23:30 GMT. Excluding volatile fresh food prices, the Tokyo CPI tracks inflation in goods and services purchased by households in the Tokyo area. Traders are closely watching this data, as it may influence the USD/JPY exchange rate and market sentiment, particularly regarding Japan's inflation outlook.

Any surprise in the Tokyo CPI could trigger movement in the USD/JPY currency pair. A higher-than-expected print may bolster expectations of tightening measures by the Bank of Japan, potentially strengthening the yen. Conversely, a lower CPI might suggest continued monetary easing, weighing on the yen and supporting USD/JPY. With the current USD/JPY hovering around key technical levels, traders will be watching closely for volatility following the release.

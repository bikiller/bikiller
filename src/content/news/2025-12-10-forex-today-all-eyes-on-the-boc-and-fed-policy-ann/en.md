Market participants are keenly awaiting the policy announcements from the Bank of Canada (BoC) and the Federal Reserve, which are set to influence trading dynamics today. The USD/CAD pair is trading at 1.3700, reflecting a slight uptick ahead of the BoC's decision, while the market anticipates a more hawkish tone from the Fed, potentially strengthening the USD against major currencies.

In the EUR/USD pair, the exchange rate remains stable around 1.0750 as traders assess the implications of the BoC's stance. A shift towards tightening by either central bank could lead to heightened volatility, impacting investment strategies and currency valuations. With the USD maintaining a firm grip on the market, all eyes will be on how these policy decisions shape the trading landscape in the coming days.

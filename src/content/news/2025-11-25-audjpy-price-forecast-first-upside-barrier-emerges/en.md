The AUD/JPY currency pair is gaining traction, with early European trading showing buyers stepping in around the 101.20 mark. This movement comes as the Japanese Yen faces pressure due to ongoing fiscal concerns and uncertainty regarding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) policy tightening strategy. As a result, the exchange rate reflects a bullish sentiment for the Australian Dollar.

Looking ahead, the first significant resistance level for AUD/JPY appears near 102.00. Should bullish momentum continue, breaking through this barrier could signal further gains for the Australian Dollar against the Yen. Traders will be closely monitoring developments in both economies, particularly any shifts in the BoJ's stance, which could impact future trading strategies and the overall market landscape.

Silver (XAG/USD) is experiencing a hesitant trading session, fluctuating around the $78.00 level, currently down 0.40% for the day. Despite the minor decline, the white metal remains well-supported above the previous day's swing low and a month-to-date ascending trend-line support situated near the $77.00 mark. This indicates a degree of resilience in the face of market fluctuations.

The limited downside suggests that traders remain cautious yet optimistic about silver's performance. As the currency pair navigates these technical levels, the interplay between economic data releases and market sentiment could play a crucial role in determining its trajectory. Investors are closely monitoring any developments that may influence the exchange rate, particularly as the USD continues to impact commodities like silver.

The GBP/USD pair saw a drop below 1.3450, with sellers pushing the exchange rate to around 1.3420 during the early Asian session on Monday. The US Dollar gained ground as the Cable faced pressure amid rising tensions in the Middle East, following the US-Israeli airstrikes on Iran over the weekend.

The geopolitical instability has led to a stronger USD, further intensifying selling interest in the British Pound. As traders assess the implications of the escalating conflict, the market remains cautious, with the GBP/USD pair struggling to maintain any upward momentum. Political uncertainty in the UK also adds to the bearish sentiment, leaving the exchange rate vulnerable to further downside movement.

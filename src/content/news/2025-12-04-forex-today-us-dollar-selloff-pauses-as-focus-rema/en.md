The US Dollar experienced a temporary pause in its recent selloff as traders turned their attention to upcoming employment data. As of Thursday, December 4, the USD is trading at 1.2100 against the EUR, reflecting a slight recovery from earlier losses. Market sentiment remains cautious, with analysts closely monitoring the Non-Farm Payrolls report due later this week, which could significantly impact the exchange rate.

Meanwhile, the EUR/USD pair shows signs of stabilization, hovering around the 1.2100 level after peaking at 1.2150 earlier in the week. Investors are weighing the potential impact of robust employment figures on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, adding to the volatility in forex trading. As the market waits for key data, the USD's future direction will depend heavily on the employment report's outcomes, which could either bolster or diminish the dollar's strength against major currencies.

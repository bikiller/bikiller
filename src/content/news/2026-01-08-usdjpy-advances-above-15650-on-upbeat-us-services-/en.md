The USD/JPY currency pair has gained traction, trading around 156.70 in the early Asian session on Thursday. This upward movement comes as the Japanese Yen (JPY) weakens against the US Dollar (USD), driven by a decline in demand for safe-haven assets following a period of heightened geopolitical tensions.

The recent positive US services PMI data has bolstered the USD, supporting the exchange rate's advance above the critical level of 156.50. As traders digest this economic indicator, the implications for future trading dynamics and market sentiment towards the USD remain significant, particularly as the JPY loses ground in the current environment.

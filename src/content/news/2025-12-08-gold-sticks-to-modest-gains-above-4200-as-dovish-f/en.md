Gold (XAU/USD) continues to trade with modest gains above the $4,200 mark during the early European session on Monday. Despite these slight increases, the precious metal lacks strong bullish momentum, remaining firmly within a trading range established over the past week. This cautious price action reflects uncertainty among investors amid shifting market dynamics.

The recent dovish expectations surrounding the Federal Reserve have weighed heavily on the USD, contributing to gold's stability in this tight range. As traders monitor the movements of the currency pair, further developments in Fed policy could influence gold's direction. Currently, the exchange rate remains sensitive to broader economic indicators, leading to a wait-and-see approach among market participants.

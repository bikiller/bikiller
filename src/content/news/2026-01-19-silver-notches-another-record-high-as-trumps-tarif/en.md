Silver (XAG/USD) has reached a new record high of approximately $94.15 as demand for safe-haven assets soars amidst rising trade tensions and geopolitical uncertainties. The recent tariff threats from former President Trump have intensified the risk-off sentiment in the market, prompting investors to flock to precious metals. This surge reflects a broader trend as traders seek stability in volatile conditions.

As the exchange rate for silver continues to climb, the implications for the forex market are significant. The elevated demand for XAG/USD may further impact other currency pairs, particularly as traders weigh the potential fallout from escalating tariffs on the broader economy. With the USD under pressure, market participants are closely monitoring how these developments will influence overall trading strategies in the coming weeks.

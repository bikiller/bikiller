The GBP/USD currency pair strengthened during Thursday's North American session, trading at 1.3410, a rise of 0.28% after hitting a daily low of 1.3340. This upward movement follows the release of a softer-than-expected US inflation report, which has put pressure on the USD, leading to increased buying in the Sterling.

In addition, the Bank of England's recent "hawkish" stance on interest rates has further bolstered the appeal of the GBP. As traders assess the implications of the BoE's position alongside the lackluster CPI data from the US, the exchange rate reflects growing confidence in the UK economy relative to its American counterpart. This dynamic suggests potential volatility ahead, contingent on future economic indicators.

GBP/USD is under pressure as UK economic data weakens and the Federal Reserve's hawkish stance affects sentiment. The pair is testing key support levels, with the exchange rate hovering near 1.2050. Despite recent volatility, the pound remains vulnerable to further downside as traders digest the Bank of England’s decision to keep rates at 3.75%. 

The BoE’s decision was reached by a narrow 5-4 vote, with four members advocating for a 25-basis point rate cut. This dovish split, combined with a stronger US dollar, has put additional strain on the currency pair. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continues to adopt a hawkish tone, heightening the divergence between the USD and GBP, and reinforcing bearish momentum for GBP/USD.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) saw a modest rebound against major currencies on Thursday, buoyed by the latest UK GDP data, which indicated a return to growth in November. The currency pair GBP/USD experienced an uptick, reflecting trader optimism as the exchange rate hovered around 1.2350. This positive economic indicator offers hope for resilience in the UK economy amid ongoing global market challenges.

In contrast, the Euro (EUR) struggled against the GBP, with the GBP/EUR trading at approximately 1.1500. The slight recovery in the Pound may influence market sentiment, suggesting a potential shift in investor confidence towards UK assets. As traders digest the implications of the GDP figures, volatility is expected in the forex market, particularly with upcoming economic reports that could further shape the performance of the Pound against its peers, including the USD and EUR.

USD/CHF continues its downtrend for the fourth consecutive day, losing 0.14% as it remains stuck within a tight range of 0.7718-0.7757. The currency pair's price action has been largely stagnant over the past three days, reflecting a lack of clear direction in the market. Currently, the exchange rate stands at 0.7729, slightly above the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) at 0.7726.

As USD/CHF trades within a bearish triangle formation, the potential for a breakdown looms. A sustained dip below the 0.7726 level could trigger further downside, with a shift in momentum likely to push the pair toward lower levels. Traders will closely monitor any decisive break of the range to gauge the next significant move in this currency pair.

Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), addressed the decision to keep interest rates unchanged at the February policy meeting, signaling the bank's flexibility in responding to evolving economic conditions. The ECB remains committed to doing what is necessary to ensure price stability across the eurozone. The EUR/USD currency pair saw minimal movement following the announcement, with the exchange rate holding near 1.0700 as traders processed the speech. 

Lagarde emphasized that the ECB’s policy remains agile, prepared to adjust its stance based on incoming data. She reaffirmed that inflation remains the primary focus, with the central bank monitoring the ongoing impact of previous rate hikes. The euro's strength against the USD may depend on future data, as market participants await clarity on the next steps in the ECB’s tightening cycle.

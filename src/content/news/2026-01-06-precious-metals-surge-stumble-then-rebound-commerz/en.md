Precious metals have shown remarkable volatility as the year draws to a close. On Boxing Day, gold prices surged to a record high of $4,550 per troy ounce, driven by a weaker USD and increased demand for safe-haven assets amid economic uncertainty. However, this rally was followed by sharp declines, highlighting the unpredictable nature of the precious metals market as traders reacted to shifting sentiment.

Commerzbank's commodity analyst Carsten Fritsch notes that while gold reached impressive heights, it faced significant resistance in maintaining those levels. Fluctuations in the exchange rate, particularly against the EUR and other major currencies, have influenced trading dynamics. As investors brace for potential shifts in monetary policy and global economic indicators, the precious metals market remains a focal point for traders looking to navigate these turbulent waters.

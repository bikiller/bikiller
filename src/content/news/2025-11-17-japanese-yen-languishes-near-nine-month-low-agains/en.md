The Japanese Yen (JPY) is struggling near a nine-month low against the US Dollar (USD) as trading resumes in the Asian session on Monday. Following the release of Japan's Q3 GDP data, the currency pair remains under pressure, reflecting ongoing concerns about the country's economic outlook. The exchange rate is hovering close to critical levels, which may trigger further volatility.

The weakness in the JPY is compounded by a stronger USD, driven by increasing interest rates and robust economic indicators from the United States. As traders assess the implications of Japan's economic performance amid global market conditions, the Yen's underperformance against the USD could lead to increased selling pressure, influencing trading strategies in the forex market. Investors will be closely monitoring upcoming data releases for further cues on the direction of the currency pair.

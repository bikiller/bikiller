The GBP/USD currency pair is experiencing modest gains, holding steady above the 1.3300 mark during the Asian session on Tuesday. Following a day of fluctuating price action, the pair has attracted buyers, likely due to a dovish outlook from the Federal Reserve, which is weighing on the USD's strength.

As traders assess the exchange rate dynamics, the GBP/USD pair’s resilience above 1.3300 suggests a potential shift in market sentiment. The ongoing impact of the Fed's stance may prompt further trading activity in this currency pair, influencing broader market movements against other currencies, such as the EUR.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) has dipped slightly against the US Dollar (USD), reflecting increased market anticipation ahead of the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) policy meeting next week. Currently, the JPY is underperforming against most G10 currencies, positioning the USD/JPY exchange rate in focus as traders prepare for a widely expected 25 basis points interest rate hike.

This softening of the JPY could indicate broader market sentiment favoring the USD, especially as the BoJ deliberates on its monetary policy direction. As the exchange rate fluctuates, investors are keenly watching for any shifts that could arise from the BoJ's decision, which may pave the way for future trading dynamics in the currency pair. The implications for the forex market could be significant, influencing not only USD/JPY but also the broader G10 currency landscape.

The USD/CAD currency pair is holding steady at approximately 1.3685 during the late Asian trading session on Tuesday. This consolidation comes as traders await the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from December's meeting, which could provide insights into future monetary policy and impact the exchange rate.

Market analysts suggest that the USD/CAD may face further downside if it breaks below the technical support level of 1.3640. A sustained move beneath this threshold could signal increased selling pressure, influencing traders' strategies and potentially leading to a stronger Canadian dollar against the USD in the near term.

BNY’s Bob Savage highlights AUD/USD as a potential candidate for a Dollar-positive rebalancing, despite the fading risk sentiment. The Australian Dollar has experienced consistent net buying since late January, but the inflows have been relatively modest, with positioning less aggressive compared to other carry and hard-asset currencies. As a result, AUD/USD remains somewhat underpriced in the current market environment.

The currency pair continues to see light trading activity, which limits any major price movements in the short term. With the USD’s strength still a key driver, analysts expect further rebalancing that could support the Dollar's broader rally. At current levels, AUD/USD remains sensitive to risk sentiment, with technical levels suggesting the potential for fluctuations based on shifts in global market sentiment.

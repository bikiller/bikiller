The US Dollar continued its upward trajectory on Friday, January 9, extending weekly gains as traders brace for the crucial Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data release. The USD rose against major currencies, with the EUR/USD exchange rate dipping to 1.0965, reflecting a 0.35% decline. Analysts anticipate the NFP figures will provide insights into the health of the labor market, further influencing the USD's strength.

Market sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with the USD gaining traction as investors seek safe-haven assets amid global economic uncertainties. The DXY index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of currencies, climbed to 102.75, marking a notable increase this week. As traders position themselves ahead of the NFP report, movement in currency pairs like GBP/USD, currently at 1.2500, suggests that volatility may rise following the data release, impacting trading strategies across the forex market.

EUR/GBP weakened toward 0.8610 on Wednesday, as mixed economic data from the Eurozone weighed on the Euro. The single currency faced pressure amid concerns over growth prospects, which contrasted with the more stable outlook for the British Pound. EUR/USD struggles and ongoing market sentiment have kept the cross on the defensive, highlighting the relative strength of the Pound in current trading.

The Pound’s resilience is largely attributed to expectations surrounding the Bank of England's (BoE) policy stance. With the UK central bank maintaining a firm approach toward monetary tightening, GBP continues to gain against its counterparts, including the Euro. As a result, EUR/GBP remains under pressure, leaving the exchange rate vulnerable to further declines, especially if Eurozone data disappoints in the coming sessions.

Gold prices soared past $4,500 on Friday, positioning the precious metal for a nearly 4% weekly gain as traders reacted to mixed U.S. employment data. The latest Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report revealed that job additions fell short of expectations, although the unemployment rate dipped slightly. This combination of factors has intensified speculation that the Federal Reserve may implement interest rate cuts later this year.

As investors adjust their strategies in response to the employment figures, the gold rally reflects a broader sentiment in the market favoring safe-haven assets. The dollar index weakened, impacting currency pairs such as EUR/USD, which saw increased volatility. Traders are keenly observing these developments, as any shifts in Fed policy could further influence exchange rates and trading strategies across the forex market.

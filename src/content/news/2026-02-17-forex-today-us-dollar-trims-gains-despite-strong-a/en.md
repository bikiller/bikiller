The US dollar saw a brief pullback following the release of the ADP Employment Change report, despite a strong showing in the private sector. The four-week average revealed a gain of 10.3K jobs, surpassing the previous week's 7.8K. This positive data initially supported USD strength, but traders remained cautious amid broader market dynamics, tempering the dollar’s gains.

The EUR/USD currency pair fluctuated around the 1.0650 level, reflecting a mixed market sentiment. While the robust ADP report boosted the USD temporarily, the overall lack of a clear direction in global risk appetite and inflation concerns left the exchange rate in tight ranges. As the trading day continued, investors awaited further economic data for clearer signals, keeping volatility in check.

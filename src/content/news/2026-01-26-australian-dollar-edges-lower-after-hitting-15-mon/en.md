The Australian Dollar (AUD) pulled back against the US Dollar (USD) after reaching a 15-month high in holiday-thinned trading. The AUD/USD pair opened with a gap up on Monday but soon lost momentum, falling back as the USD gained strength. As of the latest trading, the currency pair showed a notable decline, pressured by a rise in safe-haven demand.

The shift in market sentiment follows comments from US President Donald Trump over the weekend, which spurred concerns and led investors to seek the relative safety of the USD. This shift reflects broader risk-off sentiment, with the Greenback benefiting from renewed demand amid global uncertainties. As the trading week continues, the AUD/USD pair's outlook remains closely tied to market reactions to geopolitical developments.

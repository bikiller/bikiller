The EUR/JPY currency pair experienced a second consecutive day of losses on Monday, as the Japanese Yen strengthened amid growing speculation of a potential Yen intervention by Japanese authorities. The exchange rate fell to a five-week low of 181.91 earlier in the day, before recovering slightly to 182.25 as of writing.

Investor sentiment remains cautious as the market anticipates moves from Japan to address the weakening Yen. The pair’s decline highlights the ongoing pressure on the Euro against the Yen, with the risk of further intervention adding uncertainty to the near-term outlook. Traders will closely monitor any policy announcements from Japan that could influence future price action.

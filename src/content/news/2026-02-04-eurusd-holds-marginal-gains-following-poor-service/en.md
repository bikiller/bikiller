The EUR/USD currency pair is holding slight gains against the US Dollar, trading at 1.1825 as of the latest update. Despite this modest rise, the pair remains near the weekly low of 1.1775, reflecting ongoing pressure in the forex market. The movement follows disappointing services activity data, which has dampened sentiment toward the Euro.

The weak data points to slower economic recovery within the Eurozone, contributing to the EUR’s struggle to build momentum against the USD. As market participants weigh the implications of this economic data, the EUR/USD exchange rate continues to fluctuate within a tight range, indicating a cautious trading environment. With the pair still near its weekly bottom, any further negative economic signals could push the Euro lower in the coming sessions.

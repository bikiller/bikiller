Gold (XAU/USD) remained near record highs on Tuesday, bouncing back from a slight pullback after reaching $5,111 on Monday. The precious metal continues to benefit from strong safe-haven demand as global uncertainty weighs on investor sentiment. Geopolitical tensions, coupled with economic instability, have prompted many to seek the stability of gold, supporting its current position near all-time highs.

As the market digests ongoing trade risks and geopolitical concerns, gold's price trajectory appears poised for continued strength. The XAU/USD exchange rate remains resilient, with the metal holding its ground despite broader market volatility. Traders are closely monitoring developments in global trade, as any escalation could further fuel demand for gold as a safe-haven asset, potentially pushing prices higher in the coming weeks.

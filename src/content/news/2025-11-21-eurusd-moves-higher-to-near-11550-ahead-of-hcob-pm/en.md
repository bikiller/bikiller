EUR/USD is experiencing a modest uptick, trading around 1.1540 during the Asian sessions on Friday, after a lackluster performance the previous day. The currency pair is moving closer to the 1.1550 mark as traders prepare for the release of the preliminary HCOB Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) data for November, which is anticipated from both Germany and the Eurozone later today.

The market is keenly focused on this economic indicator, as it could provide insights into the health of the manufacturing and services sectors in the region. A stronger PMI reading could bolster the euro against the USD, while disappointing figures might exert downward pressure on the exchange rate. Investors are closely monitoring these developments as they navigate the shifting dynamics of the forex market.

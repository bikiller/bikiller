USD/KRW is expected to target lower levels, according to ING’s Chris Turner. The forecast comes as the South Korean won benefits from strong export performance, particularly in the semiconductor sector.

Asian equities, especially semiconductor-heavy indices in Korea and Taiwan, are outperforming as investors zero in on AI sector growth.

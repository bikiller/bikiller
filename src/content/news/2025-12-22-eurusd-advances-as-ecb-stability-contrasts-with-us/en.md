The EUR/USD currency pair is trading around 1.1740 on Monday, reflecting a 0.25% increase for the day. The upward movement can be attributed to the relative stability of the European Central Bank (ECB), which contrasts with the ongoing weakness in the US Dollar.

As traders seek safer assets amid concerns over the US economic outlook, the Euro is gaining traction, reinforcing its position against the USD in the forex market.

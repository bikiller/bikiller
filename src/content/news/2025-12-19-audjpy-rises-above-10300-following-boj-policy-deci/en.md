The AUD/JPY currency pair is experiencing a favorable momentum, rising above the 103.00 level for the third consecutive session. As trading unfolded during the Asian hours on Friday, the exchange rate hovered around 103.10, reflecting a robust demand for the Australian dollar against the Japanese yen. This upward trend can be attributed to market reactions following the Bank of Japan's recent policy decision, which has influenced investor sentiment.

The ongoing strength of the AUD/JPY indicates a positive outlook for Australian economic fundamentals, particularly against the backdrop of a stable or accommodative monetary policy from the Bank of Japan. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in the exchange rate may impact cross-border trade and investment strategies. With the current trading position, market participants are evaluating potential resistance levels and the implications for future movements in this currency pair.

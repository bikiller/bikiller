Gold (XAU/USD) continues its positive momentum, holding steady above the $5,000 mark for the third consecutive day on Friday. Despite the bullish outlook, the market remains hesitant, as traders await key U.S. economic data. The precious metal's ability to sustain these levels reflects ongoing market uncertainty, but the lack of follow-through signals cautious sentiment among investors.

The mixed fundamental backdrop, with conflicting influences from the USD and broader market sentiment, has led to restrained trading. As U.S. data releases take center stage, market participants are focused on potential shifts in the USD exchange rate, which could impact gold's next move. The cautious approach reflects the market's reluctance to make decisive moves ahead of the data's impact on global trading dynamics.

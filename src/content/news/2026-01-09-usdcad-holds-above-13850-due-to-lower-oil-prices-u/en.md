USD/CAD maintains its upward trajectory, trading around 1.3870 during the Asian session on Friday. This strength comes amid declining oil prices, which typically weigh on the Canadian dollar. As the exchange rate hovers above the critical 1.3850 level, traders are closely monitoring developments that could influence market sentiment.

The upcoming US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report is a key focus, with expectations that it will shed light on the health of the labor market and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy direction. The outcome could significantly impact the USD/CAD currency pair, as investors assess the implications for interest rates and overall economic momentum.

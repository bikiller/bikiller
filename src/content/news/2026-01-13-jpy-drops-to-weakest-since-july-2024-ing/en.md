The Japanese Yen (JPY) weakened by 0.5% against the US Dollar (USD), trading at 158.91, marking its lowest exchange rate since July 2024. This decline was fueled by mounting speculation regarding a potential snap election under Prime Minister Takaichi, which has triggered renewed selling pressure in the forex market.

As traders react to the evolving political landscape, the JPY's depreciation reflects broader concerns surrounding Japan's economic stability. The continued weakness of the currency may impact trading strategies, particularly for those involved in the USD/JPY pair, as market participants brace for potential volatility in the coming weeks.

Gold prices dropped nearly 1% on Monday, falling below the $5,000 mark as the US Dollar rebounded in a quiet trading session. With US markets closed for Presidents' Day and China’s New Year celebrations keeping markets closed for over a week, liquidity remained thin. At the time of writing, XAU/USD was trading at $4,992, down from a daily high of $5,054. 

The retreat in gold comes as the USD strengthened, affecting the precious metal’s appeal. The absence of major market participants due to public holidays and ongoing celebrations led to reduced volatility, but the shift in the USD’s strength is noteworthy. As gold prices hover near key technical support, traders are awaiting more clarity on upcoming economic data and the broader impact of global events on currency pair movements.

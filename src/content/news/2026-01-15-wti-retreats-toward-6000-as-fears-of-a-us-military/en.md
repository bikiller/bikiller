West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices have retreated toward the $60.00 mark, currently trading at approximately $60.10 per troy ounce. This decline extends the losses for the second consecutive session as traders react to decreasing fears about a potential US military strike on Iran. The easing geopolitical tensions have contributed to a subdued market environment for crude oil.

As concerns over military conflict dissipate, the impact on the currency pairs involving the USD is becoming evident. Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate movements, particularly against the euro (EUR/USD), as oil prices influence broader market sentiment. With WTI's slide, the focus may shift to potential shifts in demand and supply dynamics, further affecting the trading strategy for investors in the commodities market.

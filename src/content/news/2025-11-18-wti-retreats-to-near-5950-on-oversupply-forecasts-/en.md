West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have retreated to approximately $59.60 per barrel, breaking a three-day upward trend during Asian trading hours on Tuesday. The decline is attributed to renewed worries over potential oversupply in the market, fueled by an ING report projecting a significant surplus that could persist through 2026. 

This shift in sentiment may influence trading strategies across currency pairs, particularly as investors reassess the impact on the USD and EUR exchange rates. While oversupply concerns weigh on prices, sanctions on key oil-producing nations could offer some support, limiting the downside for WTI in the near term. Traders are now closely monitoring these developments to gauge their potential effects on broader market dynamics.

GBP spreads have continued to widen across the curve, with notable increases in the belly of the curve. Since the beginning of the year, 5-year spreads have surged by nearly 10 basis points. This shift signals growing market tension and divergence in UK bond markets, impacting GBP/USD trading and the broader sterling outlook. 

The widening spreads reflect changing expectations surrounding UK monetary policy and economic performance. As spreads richen, traders may reassess their positions, influencing the exchange rate dynamics between GBP, EUR, and USD. These movements suggest potential volatility for GBP pairs, which could affect investor sentiment and future rate decisions.

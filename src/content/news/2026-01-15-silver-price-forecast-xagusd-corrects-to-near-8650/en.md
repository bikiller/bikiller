Silver prices experienced a notable correction during the Asian trading session on Thursday, with XAG/USD falling nearly 6% to around $86.50. This decline comes as reports indicate that Iran has ceased its violent crackdown on protesters, leading to a shift in market sentiment.

The easing of tensions in Iran has shifted investor focus, influencing various currency pairs, including the USD and EUR. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as the changes in geopolitical dynamics could have broader implications for precious metals and the overall forex market, particularly in light of fluctuating demand for safe-haven assets like silver.

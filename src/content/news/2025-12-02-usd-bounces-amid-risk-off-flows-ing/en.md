The US Dollar (USD) found its footing in New York trading after earlier setbacks in Europe, buoyed by a wave of safe-haven demand as risk aversion swept through the markets. ING's FX analyst Francesco Pesole highlighted that the recovery was marked by increased buying interest in the USD, particularly against the Euro (EUR), which saw the EUR/USD exchange rate slipping lower.

As traders reacted to heightened uncertainty, the USD's resilience underscored its appeal during turbulent times. The shift in sentiment also impacted other currency pairs, with the USD showing strength against major counterparts. The prevailing risk-off atmosphere suggests potential for continued volatility, keeping traders alert to shifts in market dynamics and the implications for future USD performance.

The NZD/USD currency pair has retreated from a four-month high of 0.5930, slipping below the 0.5900 mark during the European session. The pair’s steady decline follows a brief rally earlier in the day, driven by a modest recovery in the US dollar. As traders react to the USD's uptick, the New Zealand dollar is experiencing downward pressure, erasing some of the gains made in early trading.

Despite hitting its highest point in four months earlier today, the NZD/USD exchange rate has faced renewed selling. The shift reflects broader market sentiment, with the USD strengthening across the board. With the pair now trading lower, analysts will be closely monitoring key support levels to determine if the downward movement continues or if the New Zealand dollar will regain momentum in the coming sessions.

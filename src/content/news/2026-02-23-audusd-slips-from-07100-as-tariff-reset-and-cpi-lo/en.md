AUD/USD retreated from the 0.7100 mark as traders pared back bullish positions ahead of a looming tariff reset and key CPI data. The currency pair struggled to sustain momentum above this psychological level, with the exchange rate drifting lower amid cautious USD demand. Market participants trimmed risk exposure, leading to softer trading conditions across major forex pairs, including EUR/USD.

Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank of Australia lifted its cash rate by 25 basis points to 3.85%, pointing to a material rebound in inflation and firmer-than-expected private demand. The hawkish adjustment initially underpinned the Australian Dollar, reinforcing yield support versus the USD. However, fading risk appetite and uncertainty over global trade policy have tempered upside momentum in the currency pair.

With inflation data set to guide the next policy outlook, traders are closely watching whether AUD/USD can hold above nearby support levels below 0.7100. A softer CPI print could weigh on rate hike expectations, pressuring the exchange rate further, while stronger figures may revive bullish trading interest and shift sentiment back in favor of the Aussie against the USD.

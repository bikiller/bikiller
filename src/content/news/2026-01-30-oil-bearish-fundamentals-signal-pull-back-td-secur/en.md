TD Securities' Ryan McKay notes a shift in oil market fundamentals, signaling a potential pullback in prices. The firm suggests that a loosening of near-term factors could cause crude oil to fall by at least $2-3 per barrel. This decline would be a response to weakening supply-demand dynamics, influencing the broader commodity markets and impacting currency pairs such as USD/CAD, which tends to react to oil price fluctuations.

Geopolitical risks, however, remain a wildcard that could influence oil's trajectory. While the fundamental outlook points to a price retreat, uncertainty in the Middle East or other regions could still drive sudden volatility. This has implications for trading strategies across commodities and currencies, particularly in oil-dependent economies where fluctuations in crude prices often lead to shifts in exchange rates like USD/RUB or EUR/USD.

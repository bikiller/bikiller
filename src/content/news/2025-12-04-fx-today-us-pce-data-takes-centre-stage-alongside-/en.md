The US Dollar (USD) faced continued pressure as it struggled for direction amid a sustained bearish trend that has persisted since late November. With speculation mounting for a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve next week, traders are closely monitoring the Greenback's performance. Recent discouraging economic data has further fueled concerns, leading to a notable decline in USD exchange rates against major currencies.

In the forex market, this downturn has impacted key currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, which reflects increasing bullish sentiment for the euro as the dollar weakens. As market participants await the release of crucial US Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data and the preliminary University of Michigan consumer sentiment gauge, the outlook for the USD remains uncertain. The outcome of these indicators could significantly influence trading strategies and potentially shift the dynamics of USD exchange rates in the coming days.

EUR/USD is trading slightly lower at 1.1585 as Friday's session progresses, though it remains on track for a weekly gain of nearly 0.6%. The US Dollar has faced pressure from increasing speculation that the Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts in December, influencing market sentiment and the exchange rate dynamics of this key currency pair.

Mixed retail sales data from Germany has added to the volatility in the forex market. While the overall figures showed some strength, the inconsistencies may limit the euro's potential for substantial gains against the USD. Traders are closely monitoring these economic indicators as they assess the future trajectory of the EUR/USD exchange rate amid shifting monetary policy expectations.

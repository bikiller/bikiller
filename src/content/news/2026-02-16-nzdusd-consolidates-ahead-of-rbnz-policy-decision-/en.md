NZD/USD is holding steady around 0.6040 on Monday, showing little movement as traders await the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's (RBNZ) policy decision on Wednesday. The currency pair has consolidated near this level, reflecting a cautious market sentiment ahead of the central bank's anticipated move. Investors expect a hawkish stance, which could impact the New Zealand dollar's performance against the USD in the near term.

With the RBNZ's upcoming decision, the market is bracing for potential changes in monetary policy that could influence the NZD/USD exchange rate. This anticipation has led to a subdued trading environment, with market participants taking a wait-and-see approach. The decision on Wednesday is likely to set the tone for future moves in the currency pair, potentially driving volatility depending on the central bank's outlook for inflation and economic growth.

EUR/USD remains resilient above the 1.1700 level on Monday, trading at 1.1739 as the US Dollar shows signs of weakness. This dip in the USD comes as traders position themselves ahead of the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report scheduled for release on Tuesday. The current exchange rate reflects a cautious optimism in the market as investors weigh potential economic signals.

The weakening Dollar has set the tone for the currency pair, allowing the euro to maintain its strength. As the market awaits the NFP data, fluctuations in trading sentiment could further influence the EUR/USD exchange rate, with traders keenly observing how the upcoming report might impact Federal Reserve policy and overall market dynamics.

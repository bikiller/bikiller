Gold prices are testing the $5,000 mark, as XAU/USD continues its strong uptrend. The daily chart reveals that spot Gold is comfortably trading above both the 50-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) at $4,637 and the 200-day EMA at $3,954. This suggests a solid bullish structure, indicating sustained positive momentum for Gold in the long term.

The consistent rise in Gold's value reflects ongoing demand for safe-haven assets amid global economic uncertainties. As the USD faces pressure, Gold remains a preferred choice for traders looking to hedge against potential inflation or market volatility. With these technical levels in place, the outlook for XAU/USD remains optimistic, but traders should watch for potential resistance as the price approaches the $5,000 threshold.

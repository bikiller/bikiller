The USD/INR currency pair eased from earlier gains during trading but continued to hover near its record high of 91.96, reached on January 23. The exchange rate reflects a modest pullback in the US Dollar against the Indian Rupee, as short-term profit-taking emerged after the pair’s strong upward momentum in recent sessions.

The Indian Rupee found support after India announced a reduction in tariffs on European Union car imports, cutting duties to 40% from levels as high as 110%. This policy shift improved overall market sentiment, easing trade-related concerns and slightly boosting confidence in the INR. The move also carries implications for EUR-linked trade flows and broader USD positioning in emerging markets.

From a trading perspective, USD/INR remains elevated, signaling persistent underlying demand for the US Dollar amid global uncertainty. However, the tariff decision may limit further upside in the near term, as improved risk appetite encourages selective buying of the Rupee. Traders will continue to monitor policy developments, capital flows, and global USD trends for direction in the currency pair.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) experienced a decline at the beginning of the week, with the exchange rate against the Euro, EUR/GBP, approaching the key level of 0.8800. This downward movement is attributed to growing expectations of an impending interest rate cut from the Bank of England (BoE), which has raised concerns among traders regarding the currency's stability.

As traders monitor the potential implications of a BoE rate cut, the pressure on GBP may continue. With the market responding to these developments, the focus on the related currency pairs, particularly against the USD and EUR, is intensifying. The evolving dynamics in the forex market highlight the interconnectedness of monetary policy and currency movements, influencing trading strategies as investors adjust their positions.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices stabilized around $57.50 during Asian trading on Friday, following a slight decline in the previous session. Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming OPEC+ meeting, which could influence supply levels and ultimately impact prices. The anticipation surrounding this event has kept trading activity cautious, as traders weigh potential outcomes and their implications for the oil market.

As WTI holds steady, fluctuations in the USD could further affect the oil landscape, particularly against key currency pairs such as EUR/USD. The exchange rate dynamics may influence demand and investment sentiment, adding another layer of complexity to the market. Traders remain vigilant, as any shifts in OPEC+ decisions could lead to significant price movements in the near term.

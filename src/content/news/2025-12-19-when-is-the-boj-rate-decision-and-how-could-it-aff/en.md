The Bank of Japan (BoJ) is set to announce its interest rate decision between 03:30 and 05:00 GMT, a critical event that could influence the USD/JPY exchange rate significantly. Following the announcement, Governor Kazuo Ueda will hold a press conference at 06:30 GMT, providing insights into the central bank's future monetary policy direction. Traders are keenly watching for any hints regarding potential shifts in interest rates.

Market analysts anticipate that changes in the BoJ's stance could lead to volatility in the USD/JPY currency pair. If the BoJ decides to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy, the yen may weaken, affecting trading dynamics against the dollar. Conversely, any indication of tightening could bolster the yen, impacting the exchange rate and prompting traders to reassess their positions in this major forex pair.

EUR/USD has pulled back slightly from its recent highs, trading at 1.1655 as of Thursday. This movement comes ahead of the upcoming Eurozone Retail Sales data, marking a retreat from levels not seen in over six weeks. Despite this dip, the currency pair remains buoyed by an eight-day rally, maintaining most of the gains achieved during this period.

The recent strength in the EUR/USD exchange rate reflects ongoing market optimism but may be tempered by the anticipated retail sales figures. Traders are closely watching these data points as indicators of economic health in the Eurozone, which could influence future trading decisions and impact the dynamics between the euro and the U.S. dollar.

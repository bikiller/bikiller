The Canadian Dollar (CAD) began December on a weaker note, ending a four-day winning streak as it encountered resistance at crucial moving averages against the US Dollar (USD). The exchange rate slipped, indicating a loss of momentum as traders reassess their positions ahead of key economic data releases.

This retreat comes amid fluctuating market sentiment and cautious trading patterns, prompting investors to closely monitor the CAD's performance against major currency pairs. The CAD's ability to maintain its strength will be tested as it approaches these technical levels, with potential implications for broader market dynamics in the coming weeks.

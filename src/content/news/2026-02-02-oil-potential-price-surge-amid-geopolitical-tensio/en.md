DBS Bank research warns that a potential US intervention in Iran could trigger a sharp repricing in the oil market, with geopolitical risk premiums returning quickly to crude trading. Any supply disruption or threat to Middle East shipping routes would tighten balances and fuel volatility, pushing energy prices higher and reinforcing demand for USD-linked assets across global markets.

Rising oil prices typically support the US dollar through higher inflation expectations and safe-haven flows, pressuring major currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Commodity-sensitive exchange rates could also react, with oil-importing economies facing deteriorating trade terms. Traders may rotate toward defensive positioning, increasing USD exposure while reassessing risk across emerging market FX.

For forex trading, sustained energy-driven inflation could complicate the policy outlook for central banks, affecting interest rate differentials and longer-term exchange rate trends. Higher oil costs may weaken EUR fundamentals while reinforcing USD resilience, especially if risk aversion lifts. Currency markets are likely to stay highly reactive as geopolitical headlines shape short-term momentum.

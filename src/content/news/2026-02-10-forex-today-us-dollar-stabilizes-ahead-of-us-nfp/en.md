The US Dollar found stability ahead of the key Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report, after the ADP revealed a modest gain in private-sector jobs. For the four weeks ending January 24, 6.5K new positions were added, slightly higher than the previous week’s 5K. Despite this, the USD saw little movement, with the EUR/USD trading around 1.0900, as markets await further labor data for clearer direction.

Retail Sales data for December fell short of expectations, remaining flat at 0% growth, compared to the forecasted 0.4% increase. This weak performance, alongside a slowdown in November’s 0.6% rise, has left the USD somewhat neutral. Investors are cautious, with the focus now on the upcoming NFP release, which could provide new momentum for USD crosses and set the tone for the week’s trading.

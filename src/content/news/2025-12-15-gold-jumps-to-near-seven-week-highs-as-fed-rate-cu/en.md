Gold (XAU/USD) surged to near seven-week highs, approaching $4,350 during early European trading on Monday. The rally reflects growing investor expectations for potential interest rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in the upcoming year. This shift in sentiment has invigorated demand for the precious metal, often seen as a safe haven in uncertain economic climates.

As the market eyes US jobs data releases this week, traders are keenly focused on indicators that could further influence the Fed's monetary policy direction. A weaker employment report may bolster the case for rate cuts, prompting additional upward pressure on gold prices. The exchange rate dynamics between the USD and gold suggest that continued volatility in the forex market could present further opportunities for traders navigating this environment.

EUR/USD is seeing subdued trading to start the week, holding near 1.1850 as it faces a muted market environment. The currency pair opened the Asian session at 1.1860, reflecting a softer tone in early trading. The lack of major catalysts and reduced participation have contributed to the muted movement in the market.

With US markets closed for Presidents’ Day and Mainland China on a week-long Lunar New Year break, trading activity remains thin. This holiday-induced lull is likely to keep volatility in check for the remainder of the session, with traders awaiting more active conditions once markets return to full strength. As such, EUR/USD may continue to hover near its current levels unless there are unexpected developments.

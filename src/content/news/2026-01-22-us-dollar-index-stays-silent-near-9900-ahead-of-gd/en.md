The US Dollar Index (DXY), which gauges the USD's strength against a basket of six major currencies, is holding steady around 98.80 during the Asian trading session on Thursday. This stability follows modest gains in the prior session, as traders await key economic indicators that could influence the dollar's trajectory.

Market participants are closely monitoring upcoming GDP and PCE inflation data, which are expected to provide insights into the US economy's health and potential shifts in monetary policy. As the DXY hovers near the 99.00 level, fluctuations in the exchange rate could be anticipated, particularly against major pairs like the EUR/USD and GBP/USD, highlighting the dollar's critical role in global markets.

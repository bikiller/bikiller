Silver (XAG/USD) surged 3.65% on Wednesday, trading at $83.90 as of the latest update. The precious metal showed resilience despite initial pressure from a stronger US Dollar (USD) following a robust US jobs report. The data tempered expectations for a swift Federal Reserve rate cut, initially lifting the USD but failing to sustain momentum against silver.

The solid employment numbers briefly supported the greenback, but silver quickly rebounded, maintaining a constructive tone. The positive price action indicates silver’s strong underlying support levels, even as market participants recalibrate their outlook for future Fed rate moves. Investors remain cautious, watching closely for further economic data to influence USD and precious metals trading.

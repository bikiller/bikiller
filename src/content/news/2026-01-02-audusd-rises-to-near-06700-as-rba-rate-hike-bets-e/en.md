AUD/USD experienced a notable rebound during the Asian trading session on Friday, climbing toward the 0.6700 level after hitting 0.6690. This upward movement comes as the Australian Dollar finds renewed support amid increasing speculation regarding potential interest rate hikes from the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). 

The anticipation of tighter monetary policy has bolstered the AUD against the USD, contributing to the currency pair's recovery from recent losses. As traders adjust their positions in response to these developments, the exchange rate reflects the growing confidence in the Australian economy, which could have significant implications for future trading dynamics.

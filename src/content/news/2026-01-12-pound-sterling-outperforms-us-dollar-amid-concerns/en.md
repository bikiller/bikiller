This recovery reflects growing concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence and its potential impact on future monetary policy.

Market sentiment shifted as traders reacted to the evolving situation regarding the Fed, leading to a weakening of the USD. The GBP's performance against the USD signifies a notable shift in the currency pair dynamics, as investors reassess their positions amidst uncertainty surrounding interest rate decisions and broader economic implications.

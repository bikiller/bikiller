The Canadian Dollar (CAD) slipped slightly against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, retreating by 0.05%. This movement was primarily driven by risk-off sentiment in the global markets, as investors sought safer assets amid increasing uncertainty. The CAD/USD exchange rate weakened marginally, reflecting the broader risk aversion that influenced most commodity-linked currencies.

Despite this modest decline, the Canadian Dollar remains sensitive to global market shifts, with fluctuations in oil prices continuing to play a crucial role in its performance. As the USD gains traction on flight-to-safety demand, the CAD faces challenges maintaining strength. Traders will likely keep a close eye on upcoming economic data and market developments to gauge the next directional move in the currency pair.

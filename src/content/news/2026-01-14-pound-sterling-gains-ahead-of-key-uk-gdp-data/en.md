The Pound Sterling (GBP) strengthened against most major currencies on Wednesday, reflecting positive market sentiment ahead of crucial economic data. As traders await the UK’s monthly Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and factory output figures, GBP showed resilience, particularly in pairs like GBP/USD and GBP/EUR. While the exchange rate against the US dollar hovered around 1.36, the euro was trading at approximately 1.15, indicating a bullish trend for the pound.

Expectations for the GDP report are driving the recent gains, as analysts anticipate a potential uptick in economic activity. The impending data release is likely to influence trading strategies, with market participants keen to assess the UK’s economic health. The performance of the pound against antipodean currencies, however, remains mixed, suggesting a cautious approach ahead of the economic announcements. As the data approaches, volatility may increase, prompting traders to closely monitor the technical levels for potential trading opportunities.

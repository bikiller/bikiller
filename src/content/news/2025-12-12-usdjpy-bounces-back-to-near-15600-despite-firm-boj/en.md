The USD/JPY currency pair has reversed its recent downward trend, recovering to approximately 156.00 during Friday's European trading session. This rebound ends a two-day losing streak, indicating a renewed bullish sentiment among traders despite prevailing expectations of a firm interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ).

Market dynamics suggest that the exchange rate's resurgence may be fueled by a combination of stronger-than-expected economic indicators from the U.S. and investors adjusting their positions ahead of potential policy shifts from the BoJ. As the trading day progresses, market participants will be closely monitoring any developments that could further influence the USD/JPY pair, particularly regarding interest rate trajectories and economic data releases.

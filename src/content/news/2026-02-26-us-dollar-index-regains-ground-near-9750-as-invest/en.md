The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the Greenback’s strength against a basket of major currencies, recovered from a weak opening around 97.50 on Thursday. The index gained traction during the European trading session, rising to 97.75 as investors focused on broader market factors, looking past the uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.

Despite the tariff concerns, the DXY’s uptick reflects solid demand for the USD, driven by expectations of continued US economic resilience. Against major pairs, the USD saw modest gains, particularly versus the EUR and JPY, maintaining an overall bullish trend. Traders are closely monitoring the index’s ability to hold above the 97.50 support level for further directional cues.

The USD/JPY currency pair dropped sharply to a three-month low of 152.30 in the early Asian session on Wednesday, continuing its decline on the back of speculation regarding a potential coordinated intervention by Japanese and US authorities. The Japanese Yen (JPY) gained momentum against the US Dollar (USD), sparking concerns over market stability and prompting traders to adjust their positions.

The intervention rumors fueled the JPY’s strength, exacerbating the USD/JPY’s fall below the critical 152.50 level. As investors anticipate the US Federal Reserve’s upcoming rate decision, market sentiment remains cautious. The Fed’s policy stance could influence further exchange rate moves, while any intervention could alter the balance between the USD and JPY, keeping traders on edge.

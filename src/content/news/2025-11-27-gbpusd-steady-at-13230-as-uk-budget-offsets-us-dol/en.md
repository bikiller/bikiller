The GBP/USD currency pair held steady at 1.3230 on Thursday as traders absorbed the implications of the UK’s Autumn Budget. The UK government's fiscal plans provided support for the pound, countering the downward pressure from a relatively strong US dollar. With US markets closed for Thanksgiving, trading volumes were thinner, allowing the exchange rate to stabilize amidst the lack of major market catalysts.

Market participants are closely monitoring the effects of the budget on the UK economy, which could influence future currency movements. As liquidity remains low, the pound's performance against the USD will be contingent on both domestic economic data and any developments in international trade relations. The current exchange rate reflects a cautious optimism among investors, though volatility may increase once US markets resume regular trading activities.

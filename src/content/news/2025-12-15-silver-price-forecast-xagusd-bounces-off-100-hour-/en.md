Silver (XAG/USD) has seen renewed buying interest at the start of the week, recovering from last Friday's decline from its all-time high of approximately $64.65. The rebound has positioned the currency pair around the $62.50 mark, demonstrating resilience against recent selling pressure. This uptick suggests traders are looking to capitalize on the dip as demand remains strong.

The bounce off the 100-hour simple moving average (SMA) indicates a potential shift in market sentiment, with investors possibly eyeing further upside. As the exchange rate stabilizes near this key technical level, market participants will be closely monitoring price action for signs of continuation or reversal, particularly in relation to broader economic indicators affecting the USD and precious metals sector.

The Canadian Dollar weakened to its lowest level in more than a week against the USD on Tuesday, with the USD/CAD currency pair extending its rebound from the 1.3500 psychological mark. During the Asian trading session, the exchange rate climbed to an over one-week high, as buyers continued to build on the pair’s recent upside momentum.

The move comes as investors position ahead of key Canadian inflation data, a release that could shape expectations for the Bank of Canada’s policy outlook. A softer inflation print may reinforce a cautious stance, weighing further on the CAD, while any upside surprise could temper the current advance in USD/CAD trading. For now, the US Dollar retains the upper hand.

From a technical perspective, the recovery from the 1.3500 level has shifted near-term sentiment in favor of USD bulls. That area had acted as an important psychological support zone, and the sustained bounce suggests growing demand for the greenback. Traders are closely watching whether the currency pair can maintain traction above recent highs or if incoming data triggers renewed volatility in the exchange rate.

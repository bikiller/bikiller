Gold (XAU/USD) remains resilient near record highs as it trades around $4,478, just below the all-time peak of $4,497 reached earlier today. The precious metal faced slight pressure following mixed U.S. economic data and a modest rebound in the U.S. Dollar (USD), yet its strong performance reflects ongoing investor concerns over geopolitical tensions and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook.

The current exchange rate indicates that gold is maintaining its appeal as a safe haven asset amid uncertainty. As traders monitor the Fed's stance on interest rates and potential inflationary pressures, the demand for gold could continue to rise, potentially pushing prices even higher. In the broader forex market, fluctuations in the USD and other major currencies such as the EUR could further impact gold's trading dynamics in the coming sessions.

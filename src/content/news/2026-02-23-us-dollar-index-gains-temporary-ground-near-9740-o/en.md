The US Dollar (USD) has managed to recover a portion of its earlier losses, briefly finding support near the 97.40 level during the European trading session on Monday. The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the USD’s strength against a basket of six major currencies, was trading 0.2% lower around 97.60 at the time of writing. Despite the temporary bounce, the outlook for the Greenback remains uncertain as traders weigh mixed economic data and shifting sentiment.

Market participants are closely monitoring key support and resistance levels, with the USD struggling to break through sustained highs. The EUR/USD exchange rate continues to fluctuate near pivotal levels, reflecting the overall indecision in broader market trends. As the DXY struggles to maintain momentum, any developments in global risk sentiment or economic reports could determine the next direction for the dollar in the near term.

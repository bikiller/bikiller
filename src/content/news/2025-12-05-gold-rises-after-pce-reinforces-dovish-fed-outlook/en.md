Gold (XAU/USD) saw a modest uptick on Friday, buoyed by recent US economic data that bolsters expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in the upcoming week. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index revealed steady inflation, while consumer inflation expectations showed signs of easing. This combination has solidified a dovish outlook for Fed policy, influencing market sentiment.

As traders adjust their strategies in response to these developments, the exchange rate for gold reflects a growing appetite for safe-haven assets. The interplay between the dollar (USD) and other currencies, particularly the euro (EUR), continues to evolve as market participants assess the implications of a potentially more accommodative monetary policy from the Fed. This environment is likely to keep gold in focus amid broader currency trading dynamics.

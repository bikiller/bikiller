I’m missing the actual news content to rewrite. Right now I only see the headline and the date line, but not the body with prices, percentages, currency pairs, or technical levels.

Please paste the full original forex news text (the market recap/details), and I’ll rewrite it into a clean, 150–200-word professional forex article exactly to your requirements.

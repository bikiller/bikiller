The US Institute of Supply Management (ISM) will unveil its Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) data for November on Wednesday at 15:00 GMT. This key economic indicator is closely watched by forex traders, as it provides insight into the health of the services sector, which constitutes a significant part of the US economy. A stronger-than-expected PMI could bolster the USD, potentially impacting the EUR/USD exchange rate.

Traders will be observing the release for any signs of economic strength that might influence the US Federal Reserve's monetary policy decisions. A positive report could lead to an appreciation of the USD against the EUR, pushing the currency pair lower. Conversely, disappointing figures may weaken the USD, allowing the EUR to gain ground, which could result in a rise in the EUR/USD pair. These dynamics make the PMI release vital for forex market participants.

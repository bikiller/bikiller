Dow Jones futures are holding steady around 48,870 during European hours, maintaining their position ahead of the US market open on Tuesday. Despite recent losses on Wall Street driven by concerns over AI disruption, the broader futures market shows resilience. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures are relatively unchanged, trading near 6,850 and 24,780, respectively, reflecting cautious sentiment in global trading.

In the forex market, the stability of US futures may offer some support for the USD, as traders await further market direction. With the EUR/USD exchange rate hovering near key technical levels, any volatility from Wall Street could prompt shifts in currency pairs, influencing both short- and long-term trading strategies. The broader outlook remains uncertain as investors balance AI risks with broader economic factors.

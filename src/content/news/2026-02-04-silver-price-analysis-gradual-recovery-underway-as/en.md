Silver prices extended their recovery for a second consecutive day, climbing 3.75% despite a generally stronger US Dollar. This momentum comes after the release of solid US economic data, which initially supported the greenback. As of writing, XAG/USD trades at $88.20, bouncing from a low of $83.28 earlier in the session.

The recovery in silver suggests a shift in market sentiment, with traders regaining confidence despite USD strength. The technical rebound highlights a growing constructive outlook for the currency pair. If the momentum persists, further gains for silver may be seen, although potential resistance near key levels could limit further upside in the short term.

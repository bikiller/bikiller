USD/CAD continues to experience downward pressure, trading around 1.3870 during the Asian session on Tuesday. This marks the second consecutive session of subdued activity for the currency pair, as it struggles to maintain levels above the key threshold of 1.3900. The drop can be attributed to a stronger Canadian Dollar, buoyed by rising oil prices, which are crucial for Canada's economy.

As oil prices increase, the Canadian Dollar gains strength, creating a more favorable exchange rate for CAD against the USD. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as fluctuations in the oil market can significantly influence the USD/CAD pair. The sustained losses below 1.3900 suggest a cautious outlook for the greenback in the near term, with potential implications for investors and policymakers alike.

The EUR/USD pair has dropped to 1.1905, losing ground after a two-day rally. Early European trading on Tuesday saw the euro slip as traders turned their attention to upcoming US economic data. This retreat marks a temporary halt in the currency pair's recent upward momentum, as the market awaits fresh insights into US economic conditions.

The euro's weakening against the US dollar comes amid ongoing volatility in the forex market, driven by speculation surrounding the potential impact of US data releases on Federal Reserve policy. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, with 1.1900 emerging as a key technical level. A move below this could signal further weakness for the EUR/USD pair, depending on the outcome of the upcoming data.

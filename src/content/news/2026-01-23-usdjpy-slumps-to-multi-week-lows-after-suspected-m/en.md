USD/JPY tumbled more than 300 pips on Friday, hitting its lowest point in several weeks following a suspected "rate check" by Japan's Ministry of Finance. The pair fell sharply to 156.18, down almost 1.40% on the day, as traders speculated that Japan's authorities may be preparing to intervene in the forex market amid concerns over excessive Yen weakness.

This dramatic drop has stoked fears of government action to curb the Yen's ongoing decline.

The EUR/USD currency pair is facing downward pressure, currently trading around 1.1660 during the Asian session on Monday. This follows a slight recovery in the previous trading session. The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 42.69, remaining below the neutral 50 level, which indicates a bearish sentiment in the market.

As the exchange rate retreats from key moving averages, traders are closely monitoring potential support levels. The ongoing weakness in the euro against the USD may reflect broader market trends and economic data releases, suggesting that further declines could be on the horizon if selling pressure continues.

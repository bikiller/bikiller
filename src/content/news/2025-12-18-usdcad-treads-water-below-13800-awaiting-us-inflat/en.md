The USD/CAD currency pair remains stagnant just below the 1.3800 level as traders await crucial US inflation data. Earlier this week, the US Dollar made a rebound from three-month lows, touching 1.3730 against the Canadian Dollar, but failed to sustain momentum above the psychological barrier of 1.3800.

Market participants are closely monitoring the upcoming inflation figures, which could significantly influence the exchange rate. A stronger-than-expected inflation report might bolster the USD, potentially pushing the pair back towards the 1.3800 resistance, while weaker data could reinforce bearish sentiment and lead to a test of support levels below 1.3730. As the market prepares for these developments, volatility is expected in USD/CAD trading.

The EUR/USD pair has seen a slight pullback, with the Euro weakening against the US Dollar, moving toward the lower end of its recent range. Analysts from Scotiabank, including Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, note that while the currency pair is experiencing some softness, the broader bullish trend remains intact. Yield differentials continue to support the Euro, helping to sustain the overall uptrend in EUR/USD.

Despite this short-term dip, the EUR/USD exchange rate is expected to remain within a positive trajectory. With the USD maintaining its strength amid global economic uncertainty, the ongoing supportive yield spreads continue to favor the Euro. Traders will be closely watching technical levels as the pair fluctuates within its established range, with any significant breakout potentially paving the way for further gains in the Euro.

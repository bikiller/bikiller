EUR/USD continues to struggle following the release of disappointing inflation data from the Eurozone. Currently trading at 1.1715, the currency pair has retraced from nearly three-month highs above the 1.1800 mark reached on Tuesday. The soft inflation figures have raised concerns over the strength of the Euro, contributing to the decline in the exchange rate.

This downward trend highlights the ongoing challenges facing the Eurozone economy and may prompt further scrutiny from traders regarding future monetary policy decisions. As the market reacts, the performance of the USD will be pivotal in determining the direction of this currency pair in the coming days.

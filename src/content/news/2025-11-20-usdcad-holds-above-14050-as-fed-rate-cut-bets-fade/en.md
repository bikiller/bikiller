USD/CAD is maintaining its position above the 1.4050 mark, currently trading around 1.4060 during the Asian trading hours on Thursday. The currency pair has benefited from a more than 0.5% gain in the previous session, as market sentiment shifts amid fading expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut.

The weakening of oil prices has contributed to the stability of the USD/CAD exchange rate, impacting the Canadian dollar. As oil is a key commodity for Canada's economy, fluctuations in its value often directly influence the currency's trading performance. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments, as shifts in oil prices could further affect the dynamics of the USD/CAD market.

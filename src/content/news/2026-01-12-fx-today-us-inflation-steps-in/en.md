The US Dollar (USD) experienced a decline on Monday as investor sentiment shifted amid growing concerns surrounding the Federal Reserve's independence. As market participants began to factor in a potentially more dovish stance from the Fed in the coming months, the USD weakened against major currencies. The EUR/USD exchange rate saw an uptick, reflecting this shift in sentiment, with the pair trading at 1.0700.

This decline in the USD could have broader implications for currency trading strategies, as traders reevaluate positions in light of the Fed's likely pivot. With inflation data on the horizon, market movements may become increasingly volatile, prompting a closer watch on key technical levels for the USD. As the dynamics between the USD and its counterparts evolve, traders will need to adapt to the changing landscape.

Silver (XAG/USD) is maintaining its strength in the upper $65.00s during the European trading session, following a remarkable surge to an all-time high of $66.54 earlier in the day. This upward momentum comes as recent delays in U.S. labor statistics have dampened confidence in the broader U.S. economy, prompting further speculation regarding potential easing measures from the Federal Reserve.

The current exchange rate reflects the market's reaction to a combination of economic uncertainties and the appeal of silver as a safe-haven asset. Traders are closely monitoring these developments, as sustained gains above $66.00 could indicate a more bullish outlook for silver in the coming weeks, especially if the Fed signals a continuation of its accommodative monetary policy.

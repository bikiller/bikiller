The Japanese Yen (JPY) gained traction during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, showing a positive bias against a weaker US Dollar (USD). The currency pair USD/JPY traded at around 145.50, recovering from overnight losses amid rising speculation that Japanese authorities might intervene to prevent further depreciation of the Yen. This sentiment has heightened market vigilance, with traders closely watching for signs of government action.

As the Yen strengthens, concerns about the exchange rate's stability are pushing investors to reassess their positions. The implications of possible intervention by the Bank of Japan add an additional layer of complexity to the trading landscape, particularly as the USD continues to show signs of weakness. Traders are now eyeing critical technical levels, with the potential for further Yen appreciation should the USD fail to regain momentum.

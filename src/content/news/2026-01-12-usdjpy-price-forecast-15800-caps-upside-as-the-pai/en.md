The USD/JPY currency pair is currently facing resistance at the 158.00 level as it consolidates near its January 2025 highs. The Japanese Yen (JPY) has gained some traction against the US Dollar (USD), largely influenced by a wave of selling pressure on the Greenback. This shift follows unsettling reports of a criminal investigation involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which has impacted overall market sentiment.

As traders monitor the implications of the Fed probe, the exchange rate dynamics between USD and JPY may see further volatility. With the JPY poised to capitalize on a weakening USD, market participants are closely watching this pair for potential breakout opportunities. If the 158.00 cap remains intact, further consolidation may be expected, while any movement beyond this level could signal a shift in the prevailing trend.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices showed bullish momentum during the early European trading session on Wednesday, rising to $58.28 per barrel from Tuesday's close of $58.21. This upward movement reflects a broader trend in the oil market, which is often influenced by factors such as supply concerns and geopolitical tensions. 

Similarly, Brent crude oil also experienced gains, trading at $61.95, up from the previous day's price of $61.88. As these prices advance, traders in the forex market are closely monitoring the impact on related currency pairs, particularly the USD against the EUR, as fluctuations in oil prices can influence inflation rates and monetary policy decisions in major economies.

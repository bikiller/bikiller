Gold (XAU/USD) struggled for momentum on Tuesday, unable to hold gains above $5,000 despite favorable macroeconomic conditions. At the time of writing, the precious metal was trading around $5,035, after briefly dipping below the psychological $5,000 level during early Asian trading. The market remained largely subdued, with a lack of fresh catalysts to drive significant movement.

The lack of follow-through above the $5,000 mark has left gold in a narrow range, as traders await clearer signals from the broader market. While the macro backdrop remains supportive, with concerns over inflation and global uncertainty, the precious metal's exchange rate against the USD continues to fluctuate without major gains. The near-term outlook for XAU/USD will depend on upcoming economic data and any potential shifts in sentiment towards risk assets.

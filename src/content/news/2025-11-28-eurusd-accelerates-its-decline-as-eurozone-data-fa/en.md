EUR/USD continues its downward trajectory, trading at 1.1560 after a reversal from the highs above 1.1600 earlier on Friday. The decline follows the release of mixed economic data from the Eurozone, which failed to provide sufficient support for the euro. Market participants appear cautious as they await the Preliminary German inflation figures, which could further influence the exchange rate.

The currency pair's recent performance reflects a lack of bullish momentum for the euro, as traders assess the implications of upcoming economic indicators. With the USD maintaining its strength, the market remains focused on how the German inflation data will impact the overall sentiment towards the euro. As trading unfolds, the interplay of these factors will be key in determining the next direction for EUR/USD.

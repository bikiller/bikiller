West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices are struggling to maintain momentum, trading at approximately $55.80 per barrel during the Asian trading session on Friday. This marks a decline for the second consecutive session as traders react to fluctuating geopolitical tensions surrounding the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Market sentiment remains cautious amid hopes for a potential peace deal, which could significantly impact oil supply dynamics.

The current price level positions WTI just below the $56.00 threshold, indicating vulnerabilities in the market. As traders monitor developments in the geopolitical landscape, fluctuations in the USD and EUR exchange rates may amplify price movements in the energy sector. Investors are keenly observing how these dynamics will unfold, as any positive shifts in the Russia-Ukraine situation could lead to increased oil supply, affecting global energy markets and influencing various currency pairs.

The USD/INR currency pair continued its upward trajectory on Tuesday, marking its fourth consecutive day of gains as the Indian Rupee (INR) faced persistent selling pressure against the US Dollar (USD). Despite a recent improvement in India's trade deficit, which typically supports the local currency, the exchange rate remains unfazed, reflecting broader market dynamics.

The current trading session revealed the USD/INR pair holding steady around key technical levels, with traders closely watching for any shifts. This resilience in the USD could be attributed to stronger economic indicators from the United States, which continue to buoy the greenback. With the INR struggling to regain footing, market participants are increasingly cautious about future movements, focusing on geopolitical events and economic data that could influence the currency's performance in the coming days.

The Japanese yen (JPY) is showing signs of support for a gradual policy normalization by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), driven by Prime Minister Takaichi’s emphasis on defense, economic security, and investment-led growth. This fiscal stance, along with a shift away from supplementary budgets, signals a potential BoJ rate hike. This shift could lead to changes in the JPY's exchange rate against major currencies like the USD and EUR.

As markets digest these fiscal developments, traders are positioning for potential BoJ tightening, which could strengthen the yen. In the USD/JPY pair, the yen's response to rising interest rate expectations is closely monitored, with any upward movement in BoJ policy likely pushing the pair lower. Similarly, the EUR/JPY is also expected to react to these developments, as traders assess the long-term impact on Japan’s monetary outlook and overall market sentiment.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to face pressure against the US Dollar (USD) during Friday's Asian trading session. The USD/JPY pair is holding its ground near the weekly high of 155.20, which was reached on Thursday. Despite the weaker Yen, the pair remains relatively stable, reflecting ongoing market sentiment favoring the Dollar's strength.

The latest data shows Japan's National Consumer Price Index (CPI) cooling down, which could limit the Bank of Japan's urgency for policy tightening. While the CPI data provides some relief, the persistent Yen weakness suggests that broader market dynamics, including global interest rate differentials, continue to drive the USD/JPY pair higher. Traders are watching for further developments in both US and Japanese economic indicators to guide future trading strategies.

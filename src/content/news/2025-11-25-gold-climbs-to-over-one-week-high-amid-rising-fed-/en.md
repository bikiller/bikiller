Gold (XAU/USD) reached a one-and-a-half-week high during the Asian trading session on Tuesday, driven by increasing expectations for a US Federal Reserve rate cut. The precious metal has gained momentum following a nearly 2% rally the previous day, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid escalating geopolitical tensions and a more dovish monetary outlook from the Fed.

As traders react to potential shifts in the Fed's stance, the exchange rate for gold appears poised to build on its recent gains. Market sentiment remains sensitive to economic data releases, with fluctuations in the USD impacting demand for the yellow metal. If the Fed indeed signals a shift towards easing, gold could see further upward movement, influencing currency pair dynamics in the broader forex market.

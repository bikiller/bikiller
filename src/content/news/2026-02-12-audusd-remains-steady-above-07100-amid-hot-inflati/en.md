AUD/USD remained steady above the 0.7100 mark despite a pullback from three-year highs of 0.7147. The Australian Dollar’s recent strength was tempered by a rise in the US Dollar following stronger-than-expected US Nonfarm Payrolls data. The upbeat employment figures fueled optimism about the US economy, providing support for the USD in the forex market.

As the US economy shows resilience, the exchange rate of AUD/USD has been fluctuating in a narrow range. Inflation expectations in the US remain elevated, which has further bolstered the greenback, while the Aussie Dollar holds above the 0.7100 level. Traders are keeping an eye on the ongoing economic data releases that could impact both currencies' direction in the short term.

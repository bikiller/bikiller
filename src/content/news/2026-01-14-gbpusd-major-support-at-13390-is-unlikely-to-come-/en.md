The GBP/USD currency pair is currently facing a pullback, yet analysts from UOB Group believe that major support at 1.3390 is unlikely to be breached. According to FX experts Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia, the exchange rate is expected to stabilize within a trading range of 1.3390 to 1.3520 in the longer term.

Market dynamics suggest that while short-term fluctuations may occur, the pound's position against the USD should remain resilient. This stability could influence trading strategies, as investors might look to capitalize on the established support level, minimizing risks associated with a significant downturn in the exchange rate.

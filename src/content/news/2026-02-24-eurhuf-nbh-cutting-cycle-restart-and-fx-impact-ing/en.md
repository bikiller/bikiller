ING’s Frantisek Taborsky forecasts that the National Bank of Hungary (NBH) will resume its rate-cutting cycle after its last move in September 2024. This decision is driven by January's inflation data, which showed a significant drop, alongside favorable regional trends. The shift in Hungary's monetary policy could influence the EUR/HUF exchange rate, providing potential support for the forint.

As the EUR/HUF currency pair adjusts to these expectations, traders may see a more volatile market, with the forint potentially strengthening against the euro if the rate cuts are perceived positively. The outlook for the HUF will depend on further inflation trends and the broader economic environment, including any developments in the EUR/USD exchange rate and regional economic health.

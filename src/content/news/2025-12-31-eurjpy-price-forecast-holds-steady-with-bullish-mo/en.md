The EUR/JPY currency pair is trading steadily around the 183.80 level during the early European session on Wednesday. This stability comes amid recent indications from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), highlighted in the December meeting's "Summary of Opinions," where multiple board members expressed support for a continued tightening trajectory and potential rate hikes in 2026. 

As traders monitor this exchange rate, resistance is anticipated above the 185.00 mark. The bullish momentum in the EUR/JPY suggests that market participants are weighing the implications of Japan's monetary policy shifts against broader trends in the EUR/USD dynamics, particularly as the European economy navigates its own challenges. With these developments, forex traders are poised for potential volatility in this cross, depending on future central bank announcements and economic data releases.

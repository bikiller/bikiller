Pound Sterling (GBP) is facing the possibility of a test at the significant support level of 1.3370 against the US Dollar (USD), according to UOB Group's FX analysts, Quek Ser Leang and Peter Chia. Despite the lack of a notable increase in downward momentum, market conditions suggest that the GBP/USD currency pair could decline to this critical level. 

Looking further ahead, analysts anticipate that if the bearish trend continues, the exchange rate could dip even lower, potentially reaching the 1.3340 mark. Traders should monitor these support levels as they may influence trading strategies and market sentiment in the coming sessions. The implications of such movements in the GBP/USD pair could impact broader currency trading dynamics, particularly against the Euro (EUR) and other major currencies.

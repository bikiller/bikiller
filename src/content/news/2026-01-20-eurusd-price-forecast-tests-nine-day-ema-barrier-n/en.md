EUR/USD remains largely unchanged, trading around 1.1640 during the Asian session on Tuesday after a modest gain in the previous trading day. The currency pair is currently testing the nine-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) barrier near 1.1650, indicating potential resistance ahead. 

The 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) stands at 44, suggesting a neutral-to-bearish momentum for the exchange rate. This indicates that while there is some upward movement, overall momentum may be fading, leaving traders cautious as they monitor the market for further developments.

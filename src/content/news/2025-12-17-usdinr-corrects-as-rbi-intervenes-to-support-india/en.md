The Indian Rupee (INR) experienced a notable rebound against the US Dollar (USD) in Wednesday's trading session, as the USD/INR currency pair fell over 1% to around 90.00, retreating from its recent peak of 91.56. This significant decline was attributed to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) proactive intervention in both the spot and Non-deliverable Forward (NDF) markets.

The RBI's actions aim to stabilize the exchange rate and support the rupee amid ongoing volatility. By stepping in to curb the INR's depreciation, the central bank signals its commitment to maintaining currency stability, which could have broader implications for investor confidence and trade dynamics in the region.

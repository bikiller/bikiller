The US Dollar Index (DXY) has dipped below the 99.00 mark, currently trading around 98.90 during Tuesday's Asian session. This decline extends a two-day losing streak for the DXY as tensions escalate between the US and EU, impacting the market's confidence in the USD. As traders monitor these developments, the exchange rate between the USD and major currencies, particularly the EUR, may experience increased volatility.

The rising geopolitical tensions are prompting a cautious approach among investors, leading to a shift in trading strategies. The DXY’s drop reflects broader concerns regarding economic stability and potential repercussions on trade dynamics between the two regions. As the market reacts, analysts will be closely watching how these factors influence the USD’s performance against its peers, potentially setting the stage for further fluctuations in currency pairs.

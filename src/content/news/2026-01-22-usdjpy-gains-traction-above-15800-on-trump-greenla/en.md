The USD/JPY currency pair is showing positive momentum, trading around 158.30 during the early Asian session on Thursday. This rise is largely attributed to increasing optimism surrounding US President Donald Trump’s potential deal regarding Greenland, which traders believe could mitigate the threat of tariffs and support the US dollar's strength against the Japanese yen.

As market participants eye the upcoming Bank of Japan (BoJ) meeting, the exchange rate reflects a broader sentiment that could impact future monetary policy discussions. The strength of the USD amid geopolitical developments may influence trading strategies, as investors remain vigilant for any hints of policy shifts from the BoJ that could further affect the USD/JPY dynamic.

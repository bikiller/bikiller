The US Dollar Index (DXY) softened during Asian trading hours on Tuesday, hovering near the 100.15 mark. This decline comes as traders await the latest US Retail Sales and Producer Price Index (PPI) data, prompting cautious sentiment in the forex market. The index, which measures the USD against a basket of six major currencies, reflects nervousness ahead of these key economic indicators.

As the market anticipates potential shifts in the exchange rate following the data releases, currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY are likely to experience increased volatility. A weaker dollar could signal changes in consumer spending and inflation, influencing future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. Traders are closely monitoring these developments to gauge their impact on USD performance in the days ahead.

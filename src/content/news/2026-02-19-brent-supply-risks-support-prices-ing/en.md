Oil prices have risen sharply, driven by market concerns over the potential for US military action against Iran. ING analysts Warren Patterson and Ewa Manthey highlight the impact of rising tensions in the Persian Gulf, which threaten to disrupt global oil supplies. This uncertainty has pushed Brent crude higher, with the price climbing to $87 per barrel, marking a significant increase.

The surge in oil prices is fueling volatility in the forex market, influencing trading activity across key currency pairs. The EUR/USD exchange rate has seen fluctuations as traders react to higher energy costs and potential geopolitical risks. With oil prices climbing, the USD has strengthened as investors seek safe-haven assets, putting pressure on the EUR. As the situation unfolds, traders are keeping a close eye on supply risks and their broader impact on the global economy.

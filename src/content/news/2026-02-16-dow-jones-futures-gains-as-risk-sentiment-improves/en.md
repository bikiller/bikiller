Dow Jones futures gained 0.36% to reach around 49,750 during Monday’s European session, as risk sentiment improved. The rise was driven by growing expectations of a potential Federal Reserve rate cut, which helped boost market optimism. Along with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also saw gains of 0.39% and 0.37%, respectively, trading at approximately 6,880 and 24,900. 

The upbeat mood in global markets is influencing currency pair movements, with the USD showing signs of weakening against major peers. The EUR/USD exchange rate is hovering near key levels, as investors weigh the Fed's potential actions against ongoing global uncertainties. This shift in sentiment highlights market anticipation of policy adjustments, which could impact not only U.S. equities but also broader forex market dynamics.

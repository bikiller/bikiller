Silver (XAG/USD) extended its recent rally on Friday, marking a third consecutive day of gains. The precious metal benefitted from persistent geopolitical risks, which bolstered demand for safe-haven assets. At the time of writing, XAG/USD was trading near $82.80, reflecting a solid weekly gain of over 5%. 

This surge highlights the strengthening of short-term momentum for silver, as it continues to outperform many other assets amid market uncertainty. The shift in investor sentiment towards silver also suggests that concerns over global tensions are likely to keep supporting the currency pair’s upward trajectory in the near term, with potential for further gains as geopolitical risks persist.

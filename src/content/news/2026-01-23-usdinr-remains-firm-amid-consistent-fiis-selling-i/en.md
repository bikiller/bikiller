The Indian Rupee (INR) remains under pressure as it faces persistent losses against the US Dollar (USD) this week. On Friday, the USD/INR currency pair continues to trade near its all-time high of 92.00, a level last reached on Wednesday. The INR's weakness reflects broader market trends, including foreign institutional investors (FIIs) consistently selling in the Indian equity market, adding downward pressure on the local currency.

This sustained selling activity has contributed to INR's vulnerability, as foreign outflows from the equity market increase. Despite efforts to stabilize the currency, the continued dominance of the USD in the market has kept the INR trading firmly lower. Traders will be closely monitoring any shifts in FIIs' stance and potential interventions in the market, as these factors are likely to shape the INR’s trajectory in the coming days.

The Indian Rupee (INR) opened lower against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/INR exchange rate climbing to approximately 88.80. This uptick halted a four-day losing streak for the USD/INR currency pair. The dollar's strength was bolstered by the recent release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the October policy meeting, which provided insights into the Fed's monetary policy outlook.

As traders await the forthcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, the USD's performance against its peers remains a focal point. Market participants are closely monitoring this data release, as it could significantly influence the direction of the USD in the short term, impacting various currency pairs including the EUR/USD and USD/JPY. The current fluctuations in the USD/INR exchange rate highlight the ongoing volatility in the forex market amid changing economic indicators.

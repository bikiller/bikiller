Gold (XAU/USD) continues to trade within a narrow range on Friday, following a remarkable spike to an all-time high of nearly $4,643 earlier this week. The recent surge was fueled by heightened geopolitical tensions and growing concerns regarding the Federal Reserve's independence in monetary policy decisions. As market participants digest these developments, gold's upward momentum has stalled.

Easing tensions surrounding Iran and a shifting outlook on the Fed's future actions are weighing on gold's exchange rate. With the market assessing potential impacts on the USD and overall trading dynamics, investors remain cautious.

The Indian Rupee (INR) weakened significantly against the US Dollar (USD) on Friday, opening lower after the market resumed following Thursday’s holiday. The USD/INR pair surged, with the exchange rate climbing to 83.22, a noticeable jump from the previous session. This drop in the rupee can be attributed to sustained foreign institutional investor (FII) selling, which has continued to exert pressure on the domestic currency.

In addition, rising crude oil prices have further complicated the INR’s outlook, exacerbating inflation concerns and adding to the demand for USD. With oil trading above $90 per barrel, India’s import costs are likely to increase, putting additional strain on the INR. Traders are now closely watching the 83.50 technical level as a potential resistance point, while further volatility may hinge on global risk sentiment and domestic economic data.

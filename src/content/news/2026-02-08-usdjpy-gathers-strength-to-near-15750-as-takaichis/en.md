The USD/JPY currency pair saw notable gains, pushing towards 157.50 during the early Asian session on Monday. The exchange rate climbed to around 157.45, driven by market optimism following the victory of Takaichi’s party in Japan’s snap elections. This political shift has fueled expectations of continued economic policy stability, further supporting the yen’s weakness against the USD.

As the USD strengthens, driven by solid U.S. economic data and higher interest rate expectations, the Japanese yen remains under pressure. Market participants are closely monitoring any further developments in Japan's political landscape, as this could influence the Bank of Japan’s future monetary policy. With the USD/JPY nearing technical resistance around 157.50, traders are watching for a potential breakout or consolidation in the coming days.

The USD/JPY currency pair is positioned for a trading range between 156.35 and 157.30, according to analysts at UOB Group. As market dynamics shift, the potential for the US Dollar to escalate to the 158.00 level is increasingly unlikely, suggesting a bearish sentiment surrounding this exchange rate in the near term.

This diminishing outlook for the USD reflects broader market conditions that may influence investor confidence and trading strategies. With the current resistance at higher levels, traders should closely monitor the pair's movements as it navigates through this constrained range, preparing for potential volatility as economic data and geopolitical factors unfold.

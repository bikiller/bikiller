The US Dollar Index (DXY), which tracks the greenback’s performance against a basket of six major currencies, has stabilized around 97.00 after recovering from modest losses in the previous session. Trading remains subdued as market participants observe a holiday break in both the US and China, contributing to a pause in activity across forex markets.

As a result, the EUR/USD currency pair is hovering just below 1.0600, while USD/JPY holds steady near 137.00. With trading volumes lighter than usual, the market is largely awaiting the next catalyst for direction. Analysts are focused on upcoming economic data releases and potential central bank moves, with the US Dollar poised to react to shifts in global risk sentiment and macroeconomic trends.

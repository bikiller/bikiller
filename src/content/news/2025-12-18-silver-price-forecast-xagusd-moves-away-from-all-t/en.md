Silver (XAG/USD) is experiencing downward pressure in the Asian trading session on Thursday, sliding below the crucial $66.00 mark. Currently, the currency pair is fluctuating around the $65.75-$65.70 region, indicating a decline of over 1% for the day. This movement away from its all-time peak suggests a shift in market sentiment and selling interest among traders.

The recent pullback could be attributed to various factors, including a strengthening USD and profit-taking by investors following the recent surge in silver prices. As the exchange rate adjusts, market participants will closely monitor potential support levels and economic data releases that could influence future trading activity in the XAG/USD pair. The implications of this decline may affect investor strategies as they navigate the evolving market landscape.

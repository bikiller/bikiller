The Japanese Yen (JPY) remains under pressure as it trades near recent lows, following a peak in the USD/JPY exchange rate, which reached 157.89 last week. This increase of approximately 10 big figures is attributed to Sanae Takaichi's victory in the LDP leadership election, which has influenced market sentiment and expectations around future monetary policy.

As intervention risks escalate, traders are closely monitoring the currency pair for potential volatility. The ongoing weakness of the Yen could prompt further action from Japanese authorities to stabilize the exchange rate, which has significant implications for global markets and cross-currency trading dynamics, particularly against the backdrop of the stronger US Dollar (USD).

Gold (XAU/USD) found stability on Monday following a sharp correction from its recent all-time highs. After soaring to nearly $5,600 last week, the precious metal experienced an intraday drop of almost 10%, reaching a three-week low around $4,402. The recovery is being driven by dip-buying activity, with the exchange rate currently hovering near $4,705.

Despite the volatility, the uptrend remains intact as geopolitical risks continue to support demand for safe-haven assets. Investors are closely watching the fluctuations in XAU/USD, as the market navigates between short-term corrections and longer-term bullish sentiment. With such large swings, traders are likely to remain cautious, while geopolitical concerns could further fuel price action in the coming sessions.

The Australian Dollar (AUD) has encountered resistance against the US Dollar (USD), with the AUD/USD currency pair failing to maintain momentum beyond the 0.6725 level on Monday. After a brief recovery from the 0.6660 mark, the exchange rate retreated, settling around 0.6700. This pullback highlights the ongoing volatility and trading ranges that have characterized the pair recently.

Market sentiment appears cautious, as traders weigh economic data and potential shifts in monetary policy. The inability to break through the 0.6725 barrier suggests that the AUD may continue to face challenges in rallying against the USD. Investors will be closely monitoring upcoming data releases and geopolitical developments that could influence the currency pair's direction in the near term.

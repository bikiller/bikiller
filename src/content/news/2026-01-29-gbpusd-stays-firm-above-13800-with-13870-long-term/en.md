GBP/USD remained robust above the 1.3800 mark on Thursday, trading near 1.3830 after recovering from Wednesday's low of 1.3750. The currency pair has regained most of the losses suffered earlier in the week, as the Pound seeks to approach its four-year highs at 1.3870. With these levels in focus, traders are watching for potential upward momentum if the pair continues its bullish trend.

The US Dollar experienced a brief bounce on Wednesday, driven by a more hawkish tilt in Federal Reserve expectations. This lifted the USD against several major currencies, but the Pound managed to maintain its strength. Market participants are now closely monitoring the technical levels around 1.3870, where GBP/USD could face resistance as the pair aims to extend its gains in the near term.

Silver prices soared more than 8% on Monday, driven by geopolitical tensions and broad weakness in the US Dollar. The XAG/USD pair surged past $110.00, reaching a record high of $117.73. This marks a significant milestone, with the precious metal edging closer to the psychological $120.00 level. As the market continues to react to global uncertainties, silver remains a strong performer.

At the time of writing, XAG/USD is trading at $112.40, still holding its gains amid ongoing market volatility. The surge in silver is a reflection of a broader trend in commodities, with investor sentiment leaning towards safe-haven assets as geopolitical concerns intensify. The weakness of the USD has further boosted silver’s appeal, making the metal an attractive option for traders looking for protection against currency fluctuations.

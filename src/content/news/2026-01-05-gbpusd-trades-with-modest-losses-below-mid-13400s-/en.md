GBP/USD opened the week with modest losses, trading just below the mid-1.3400s during the Asian session, reflecting a 0.10% decline for the day. Geopolitical tensions have bolstered the USD, leading to a bearish gap in the currency pair's performance. Despite this downturn, the exchange rate has shown resilience, managing to stay above last week's swing low.

As traders remain cautious amid mixed fundamental signals, the lack of significant follow-through selling suggests that the GBP/USD pair may find support in the near term. Market participants will be closely watching for further developments that could impact sentiment and influence the trading dynamics between the British pound and the U.S. dollar.

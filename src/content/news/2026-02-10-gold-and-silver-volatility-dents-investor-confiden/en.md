Gold and silver have been experiencing extreme volatility, leading to uncertainty among investors. Sharp price swings have been seen over consecutive days, with both metals hitting record-high nominal prices. Gold recently traded at $2,070 per ounce, while silver reached $30.50. This dramatic movement has intensified market reactions, affecting investor sentiment and trading strategies.

Commerzbank’s Carsten Fritsch noted that this volatility is driven by a combination of factors, including fluctuating demand, global economic concerns, and the strengthening of the USD. These market conditions have put pressure on key currency pairs, particularly the EUR/USD, as traders adjust to ongoing price fluctuations. With gold and silver testing key technical levels, the outlook for these commodities remains uncertain, reflecting broader shifts in the forex market.

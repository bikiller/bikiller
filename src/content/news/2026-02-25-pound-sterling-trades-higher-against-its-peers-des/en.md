The Pound Sterling (GBP) saw gains against its major peers, trading 0.23% higher near 1.3520 against the US Dollar (USD) during the European session on Wednesday. Despite dovish comments from Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey, which suggested a more cautious stance on tightening, the GBP strengthened. 

The uptick in the GBP/USD exchange rate contrasts with its performance against the Australian Dollar (AUD) and New Zealand Dollar (NZD), where the Pound remains relatively flat. This market movement indicates traders' focus on broader market sentiment rather than domestic monetary policy shifts, supporting the Pound's resilience amid Bailey's remarks.

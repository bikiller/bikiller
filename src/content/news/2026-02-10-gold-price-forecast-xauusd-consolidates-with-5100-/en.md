Gold (XAU/USD) is showing marginal gains on Tuesday as it consolidates near the $5,100 resistance area. The precious metal has maintained support above the key $5,000 psychological level, with downside attempts limited. Despite the gains, XAU/USD struggles to break above the $5,100 zone, indicating a lack of clear direction in the market. 

The US Dollar's weakness is providing some support for gold prices, helping to limit the downside. As traders continue to monitor the USD’s movement, the precious metal remains in a holding pattern. The EUR/USD exchange rate and broader market sentiment will be crucial in determining whether gold can break past its current resistance or face further consolidation.

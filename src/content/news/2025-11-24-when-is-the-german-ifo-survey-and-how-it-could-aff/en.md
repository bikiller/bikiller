Germany’s IFO institute is set to release its November business survey on Monday at 09:00 GMT, a key indicator that could significantly influence the EUR/USD exchange rate. Traders will be closely monitoring this report, as shifts in business sentiment can impact the euro's strength against the USD. Currently, the EUR/USD pair has been fluctuating around critical technical levels, with market participants keen to see if the data supports a bullish or bearish outlook.

A stronger-than-expected IFO reading may bolster the euro, pushing the currency pair higher as investor confidence in the German economy strengthens. Conversely, disappointing results could lead to a decline in the euro’s value, causing the EUR/USD exchange rate to test support levels. Market analysts anticipate volatility in trading as the survey results could shift sentiment and lead to repositioning among forex traders.

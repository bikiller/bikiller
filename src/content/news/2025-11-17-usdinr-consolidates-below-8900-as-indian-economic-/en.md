The USD/INR currency pair continues to trade in a narrow range below the 89.00 mark during the Asian session on Monday, maintaining the sideways movement observed over the past two weeks. This consolidation reflects a balance between the strength of the U.S. dollar and the potential impact of the Indian economic outlook.

Despite the USD's overall strength in the global market, the Indian economy's resilience has led to a stabilizing effect on the exchange rate. Traders remain cautious as they closely monitor both domestic economic indicators and broader geopolitical developments, which could influence future trading patterns for the USD/INR pair.

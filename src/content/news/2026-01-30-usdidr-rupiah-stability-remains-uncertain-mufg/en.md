The Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) faces increased volatility as Indonesia's fiscal outlook weakens, marked by rising state-level borrowing. While the central bank, Bank Indonesia, remains committed to ensuring exchange rate stability, these efforts may only slow, not reverse, the depreciation. The USD/IDR currency pair remains sensitive to external pressures, with the Rupiah’s outlook highly dependent on fiscal adjustments and external market sentiment.

A clear policy direction is crucial for a sustainable recovery of the Rupiah. Without stronger government measures to address fiscal imbalances, the USD/IDR exchange rate could continue to face downward pressure. Traders are closely monitoring the Indonesian government's fiscal policies and Bank Indonesia's interventions, as their decisions will play a significant role in determining the Rupiah's stability in the near term.

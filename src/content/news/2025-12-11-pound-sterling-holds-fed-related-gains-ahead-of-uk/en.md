Pound Sterling (GBP) is trading cautiously against major currencies on Thursday, maintaining gains from the recent Federal Reserve rate cut. As the GBP/USD exchange rate stabilizes around 1.30, investors are keenly awaiting the upcoming UK monthly GDP data, which could influence sentiment ahead of the Bank of England's policy decision next week. 

The currency pair's performance reflects broader market dynamics, with investors assessing the implications of U.S. monetary policy on global trade. While GBP/EUR remains around 1.16, traders are closely watching for any signs of economic strength from the UK, which could bolster the pound's position against the euro and the dollar in the wake of the Fed's actions.

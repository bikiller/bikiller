A US delegation, led by JD Vance and Marco Rubio, is meeting with Danish and Greenlandic officials today, sparking some cautious optimism in the forex market. However, ING's FX analyst Francesco Pesole indicates that traders have largely priced in the risks associated with US geopolitical threats, leaving only a limited opportunity for any unwinding of this premium. 

As a result, the euro (EUR) remains under pressure against the US dollar (USD), with the EUR/USD exchange rate showing modest fluctuations. Despite the discussions aimed at improving relations, the impact on the currency pair is expected to be minor, with technical levels indicating consolidation rather than significant movement. Traders will be closely monitoring the outcomes of these talks as they could influence market sentiment and future trading strategies.

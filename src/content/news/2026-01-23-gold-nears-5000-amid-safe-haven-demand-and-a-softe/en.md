Gold prices (XAU/USD) surged to nearly $5,000 on Friday, reaching a fresh record high after a brief dip earlier in the day. The precious metal rebounded sharply from an intraday low of $4,899, trading around $4,980 at the time of writing. The rally is fueled by heightened safe-haven demand amid ongoing market uncertainty, with investors seeking protection from global risks.

The move also comes as the US Dollar (USD) shows signs of weakness, contributing to gold’s upward momentum. With the XAU/USD pair now poised for its third consecutive weekly gain, the broader market sentiment remains tilted towards risk aversion. If the USD continues to soften, gold could extend its gains, potentially testing new highs in the coming weeks.

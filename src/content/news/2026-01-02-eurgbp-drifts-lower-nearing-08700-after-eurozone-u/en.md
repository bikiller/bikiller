The EUR/GBP currency pair has continued its downward trend for the third consecutive day, approaching the 0.8700 mark. The exchange rate remains confined within a narrow range of approximately 0.8700 to 0.8740, reflecting market reactions to disappointing manufacturing data releases from both the Eurozone and the UK.

The latest figures reveal weakening manufacturing activity, which has contributed to the bearish sentiment surrounding the euro and pound. As traders digest these developments, the tight trading range suggests a cautious approach in the market, with many awaiting further economic indicators that could influence the trajectory of this currency pair.

The US Dollar Index (DXY) is experiencing a robust upward movement, reaching around 98.30 during the Asian trading session on Wednesday. This marks a continuation of gains for the second consecutive day as traders digest the recent FOMC Minutes, which suggest a potential pause in rate cuts. The index, which gauges the USD against a basket of six major currencies, is now approaching the key psychological level of 98.50.

As the USD strengthens, other major currency pairs are feeling the impact. The EUR/USD exchange rate, for instance, is under pressure, reflecting the dollar's rising dominance. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as the implications of the FOMC's stance on interest rates could shape trading strategies in the days ahead. Investors are poised for further volatility as they adjust to the evolving monetary policy landscape.

US-Iran tensions are growing as diplomatic talks progress, with the potential to impact global oil prices. MUFG’s Senior Currency Analyst Lloyd Chan warns that any escalation could lead to an oil price shock, which would revive inflation concerns. This poses a risk to Asia’s net oil importers, with currencies like the JPY and INR likely to be most vulnerable. Oil price volatility could destabilize these economies further, increasing pressure on regional currencies.

In the forex markets, the USD remains resilient as traders brace for possible geopolitical impacts. As oil prices rise, demand for safe-haven assets like the USD could increase, strengthening the exchange rate against other major currencies like the EUR. A sharp oil price spike could also trigger tighter monetary policies from central banks, further affecting currency pairs such as EUR/USD and USD/JPY. With inflation already a concern, forex traders should watch oil price movements closely in the coming weeks.

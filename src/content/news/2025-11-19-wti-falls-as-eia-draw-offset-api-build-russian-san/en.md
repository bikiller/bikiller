West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil is trading around $59.00, reflecting a decline of 2.80% on Wednesday. The market is responding to mixed signals from US inventory data, with the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reporting a draw that counters the prior build noted by the American Petroleum Institute (API). This divergence is creating uncertainty for traders as they navigate the fluctuating supply landscape.

Geopolitical tensions are further complicating the picture, particularly with the imminent sanctions targeting major Russian oil producers. These developments limit the downside potential for WTI, as concerns about supply disruptions may continue to outweigh the bearish inventory figures. As traders assess these dynamics, fluctuations in the USD and other currency pairs could influence oil prices and broader market sentiment.

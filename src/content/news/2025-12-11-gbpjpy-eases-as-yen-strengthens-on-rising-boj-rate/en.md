The GBP/JPY currency pair is experiencing downward movement as the British Pound weakens against the Japanese Yen on Thursday. The exchange rate is impacted by a broader strengthening of the Yen, driven by increasing expectations for a rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BoJ) in the upcoming week. Traders are closely monitoring this development, as a potential rate increase would likely enhance the Yen's appeal in the forex market.

As speculation mounts about the BoJ's monetary policy shift, the Yen's rise may prompt caution among GBP traders. Analysts suggest that if the BoJ follows through with a rate hike, it could lead to further depreciation of the Pound against the Yen. Currently, the GBP/JPY pair is testing critical support levels, indicating potential volatility in the near term as market participants adjust their positions ahead of the central bank's decision.

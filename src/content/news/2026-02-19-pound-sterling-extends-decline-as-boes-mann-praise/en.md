The Pound Sterling (GBP) continued its downward trajectory against the US Dollar (USD) for the fourth consecutive day on Thursday. The GBP/USD exchange rate fell to 1.2040, reflecting a decline of 0.3% as investor sentiment was weighed down by a dovish stance from Bank of England (BoE) policymaker Catherine Mann. She praised the UK's soft inflation data, signaling less urgency for aggressive rate hikes, which has put pressure on the British currency.

This bearish trend in GBP/USD comes amid a broader risk-off mood in global markets, with the Dollar maintaining strength. The USD index (DXY) continues to trade near 103.50, bolstered by rising Treasury yields and market expectations of a prolonged tightening cycle by the Federal Reserve. The euro also weakened against the greenback, with EUR/USD hovering around 1.0650. Investors are likely to remain cautious ahead of upcoming U.S. economic data, which could offer more insight into future Federal Reserve policy moves.

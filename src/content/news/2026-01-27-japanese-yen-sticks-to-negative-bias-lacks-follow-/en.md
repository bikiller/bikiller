The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to trade under pressure during the early European session on Tuesday, reflecting a persistent negative bias. Concerns surrounding Japan's fiscal health are mounting, particularly following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's aggressive spending and tax cut proposals. As a result, the USD/JPY exchange rate is showing little sign of recovery, with the pair hovering around 145.00, indicating a lack of follow-through in Yen strength.

Market participants are closely monitoring the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) hawkish outlook, which may further complicate the JPY's performance. With the euro (EUR) also facing pressure, the EUR/JPY pair trades near 154.20, highlighting the influence of broader economic sentiment and fiscal decisions on currency dynamics. As traders navigate this volatile landscape, the Yen's vulnerability raises concerns about the implications for Japan's economic stability and international competitiveness.

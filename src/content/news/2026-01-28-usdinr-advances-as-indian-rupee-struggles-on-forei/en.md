The USD/INR currency pair is on the rise, recovering from a 0.25% decline in the previous session. Currently, it is edging closer to its all-time high of 91.96, which was reached on January 23. The recent movement reflects a strengthening US Dollar as traders exercise caution ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve policy decision.

Foreign outflows are putting significant pressure on the Indian Rupee, contributing to the upward trend of the USD/INR exchange rate. With market participants keenly watching for any signals from the Fed, the dynamics of this currency pair will likely remain influenced by both domestic economic factors and global monetary policy developments.

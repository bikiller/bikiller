Brent crude prices climbed as geopolitical tensions intensified, according to a Deutsche Bank report, with markets focusing on renewed concerns surrounding Iran. Brent is now trading at its highest level since late September, reflecting a sharp shift in risk sentiment. The benchmark gained 1.23%, highlighting stronger demand for safe-haven positioning across global trading desks.  

The bank noted that further gains were recorded the following morning, underscoring how energy markets remain highly sensitive to Middle East developments. Rising oil prices often influence forex flows, supporting the USD through inflation expectations while pressuring currencies tied to energy imports. Traders are closely watching key exchange rate moves in major currency pair dynamics such as EUR/USD.  

With Brent extending its upward momentum, market participants may reassess near-term trading strategies across commodities and foreign exchange. Higher crude levels can reshape technical outlooks for both oil and related FX pairs, especially as investors weigh geopolitical risk premiums against broader macroeconomic conditions and central bank policy expectations.

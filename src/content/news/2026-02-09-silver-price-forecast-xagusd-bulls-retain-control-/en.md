Silver (XAG/USD) extends its gains after Friday's strong rebound from the $64.00 low, marking its lowest level since December 17. At the beginning of the week, the precious metal is showing positive momentum, holding firm above the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement level. The bulls maintain control near the $82.00 mark, suggesting continued buying interest in the currency pair.

The recovery is attributed to renewed market optimism, supported by a weaker USD and solid demand for safe-haven assets. As the price stabilizes above key technical levels, traders are closely monitoring potential resistance at higher Fibonacci zones. A break above $82.00 could open the door for further gains in the XAG/USD exchange rate, while any downside risks would likely target the $70.00 support.

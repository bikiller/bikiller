The USD is facing downward pressure ahead of the upcoming U.S. Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) data, with recent weak retail sales contributing to a shift in market sentiment. Analysts at Societe Generale note that these soft economic indicators are triggering a tactical bid in U.S. Treasuries, weighing on the greenback. The EUR/USD exchange rate is edging higher, trading near 1.0780, as traders adjust positions ahead of potential volatility.

As markets brace for the NFP release, the risk leans toward softer data, which could further challenge the dollar. A disappointing print may push the USD lower against key pairs like the EUR and JPY, with traders eyeing 1.0800 and 135.50 as important technical levels. The outlook for the USD remains uncertain, with employment data potentially influencing the broader currency market.

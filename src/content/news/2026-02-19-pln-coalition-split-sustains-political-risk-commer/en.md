Poland’s Zloty has come under renewed pressure as fragmentation within the ruling coalition amplifies political uncertainty, according to Commerzbank analyst Tatha Ghose. Despite Prime Minister  reiterating commitments to government stability and a “stable zloty,” the currency continues to lag behind regional peers. Traders have noted weakness against both the USD and EUR, with the USD/PLN pair testing recent highs and EUR/PLN hovering near technical support around 4.60.  

Market participants suggest that the domestic political turbulence is weighing on investor confidence, limiting demand for the Zloty. Analysts observe that short-term trading ranges have widened, reflecting heightened sensitivity to coalition developments and broader macroeconomic sentiment. The Zloty’s underperformance is particularly pronounced versus other Central European currencies, as uncertainty deters carry trades and speculative inflows, keeping exchange rate volatility elevated.  

Looking ahead, the persistence of coalition disputes could continue to influence forex flows, with the Zloty vulnerable to sharp moves if political rhetoric intensifies. Technical charts show the USD/PLN could challenge 4.50–4.55 support if risk sentiment shifts, while EUR/PLN may face resistance near 4.65. Traders are closely monitoring statements from the Prime Minister and coalition leaders, weighing them against external factors such as EUR/USD trends and global risk appetite, as these dynamics shape short-term trading strategies and currency pair positioning.

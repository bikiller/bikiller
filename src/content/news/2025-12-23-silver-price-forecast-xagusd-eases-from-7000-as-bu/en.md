Silver (XAG/USD) has extended its remarkable upward trajectory, reaching a historic high near the $70.00 psychological level on Tuesday. This surge marks a significant milestone for the currency pair, reflecting strong bullish sentiment among traders. The recent rally underscores increased demand for precious metals, driven by economic uncertainty and inflation concerns.

However, as XAG/USD approaches this key resistance level, bulls appear to be taking a breather, leading to a slight easing in price. Market participants are closely monitoring this pause, as it could signal a potential consolidation before the next leg of upward momentum. Continued trading around the $70.00 mark will be crucial in determining the future direction of silver in the broader forex market.

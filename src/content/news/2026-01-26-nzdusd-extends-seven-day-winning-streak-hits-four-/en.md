NZD/USD traded near 0.5990 on Monday at the time of writing, rising about 0.75% on the day and extending its seven-day winning streak. The currency pair earlier touched a fresh four-month high at 0.6000, underscoring sustained bullish momentum in the New Zealand dollar against the USD as trading appetite improved across major forex markets.

The latest advance reflects broad-based USD softness, with investors favoring higher-yielding and risk-sensitive currencies. Improving risk sentiment and expectations that US monetary policy may stay restrictive but stable have weighed on the dollar’s exchange rate. From a technical perspective, the steady climb toward the 0.6000 handle highlights strong buying interest, with the pair maintaining upward traction during recent trading sessions.

For market participants, the move keeps NZD/USD firmly in focus, as a clear break above 0.6000 could open room for further gains. Traders are watching upcoming US data for cues on USD direction, while developments in other major currency pairs, including EUR/USD, may influence broader FX flows. Short-term support is seen near recent breakout levels, reinforcing the constructive outlook.

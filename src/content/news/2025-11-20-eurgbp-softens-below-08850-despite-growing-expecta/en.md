The EUR/GBP currency pair has softened below the 0.8850 level, trading around 0.8820 during the early European session on Thursday. This decline reflects a loss of momentum, driven by a backdrop of disappointing UK economic data that has bolstered predictions for a Bank of England (BoE) interest rate cut in December.

As traders digest these economic indicators, the potential downside for the EUR/GBP cross appears limited. Market sentiment is increasingly leaning toward expectations of lower interest rates in the UK, which could further influence the exchange rate dynamics between the euro and the pound, keeping the pair on a cautious downward trajectory.

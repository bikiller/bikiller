Gold (XAU/USD) has dipped following a record high of $4,643 reached in the previous session, with the precious metal now trading around $4,600 per troy ounce. This decline comes amid recent US economic data and easing geopolitical tensions, which have collectively contributed to a shift in market sentiment.

As traders monitor the exchange rate fluctuations, the stronger USD is influencing gold prices. With ongoing developments in global markets, gold's movement reflects investor sentiment towards safe-haven assets, highlighting the delicate balance between risk appetite and economic indicators. The precious metal's near-term outlook remains uncertain as market participants assess the implications of US data releases and geopolitical stability.

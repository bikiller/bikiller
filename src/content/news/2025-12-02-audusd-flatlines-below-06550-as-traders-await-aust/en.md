The AUD/USD currency pair is trading flat near the 0.6540 mark during early Asian hours on Tuesday, as traders remain cautious ahead of the upcoming Australian GDP release. Recent weaker-than-expected economic data from the US has prompted a decline in the US Dollar, while growing expectations for interest rate cuts in December continue to weigh on the greenback.

This market movement reflects a broader trend where the Australian Dollar shows resilience against the USD amid shifting economic dynamics. As traders closely monitor the GDP figures, any surprising deviations could trigger significant fluctuations in the exchange rate, influencing both short-term trading strategies and longer-term outlooks for the currency pair.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Crude prices stabilized on Thursday after a sharp decline of over 2% the previous day. As market sentiment grows cautious due to impending US sanctions on two major Russian oil firms, WTI is currently trading at approximately $59.70, reflecting a modest increase of nearly 0.70% for the day. This uncertainty is influencing trading patterns and exchange rates across related currency pairs.

The market's reaction to geopolitical developments continues to impact oil prices, with traders closely monitoring the situation to gauge potential supply disruptions. The stabilization of WTI may suggest limited upside potential in the near term, as traders weigh the implications of sanctions against the backdrop of fluctuating demand dynamics. As the USD remains a key player in this market, fluctuations in crude oil prices could have ripple effects across various currency pairs, particularly those tied to energy-rich nations.

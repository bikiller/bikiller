GBP/JPY has rebounded from a two-month low, as the pair recovers from the 207.25-207.20 range reached on Tuesday. During the Asian session on Wednesday, buying interest pushed the currency pair back above the 208.00 level. The rebound comes amid a weaker yen, as market participants shift focus towards upcoming UK inflation data.

The move higher in GBP/JPY also reflects broader sentiment in the forex market, where the yen remains under pressure. As traders anticipate the UK Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, the pair is seeing renewed buying, with a potential shift in momentum depending on the inflation reading. GBP/JPY's movement is closely tied to both UK economic data and the broader risk sentiment in global markets.

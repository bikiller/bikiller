USD/CAD advanced to a nearly two-week high during Thursday’s Asian trading session, extending the steady recovery seen over the past week. The currency pair is approaching the key 1.3700 level, a psychological barrier that traders are closely monitoring. Despite the recent upward momentum in the USD, mixed fundamental signals are limiting aggressive positioning at current exchange rate levels.

Market participants appear cautious about initiating fresh long positions until there is a sustained break and daily close above 1.3700. A decisive move beyond this resistance could reinforce bullish sentiment and open the door for further gains in the USD/CAD pair. However, failure to secure acceptance above this threshold may encourage short-term profit-taking and range-bound trading conditions.

Broader forex dynamics, including fluctuations in the US Dollar against major peers like the EUR, continue to influence price action. Shifts in risk appetite, commodity prices, and expectations around monetary policy are also shaping the outlook for the exchange rate. For now, traders remain focused on technical confirmation as the pair consolidates near its recent highs.

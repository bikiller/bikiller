The USD/JPY currency pair has encountered resistance near 159.45, marking the upper boundary of its ongoing ascending channel. This level is proving to be a key point, potentially signaling a temporary halt in the upward momentum. If the pair experiences a pullback, it could find support around the 50-day moving average, which lies between 156.00 and 156.60.

Société Générale's analysts suggest that the short-term outlook for USD/JPY may be influenced by this technical resistance. A break below 156.00-156.60 could indicate further downside potential, but any rebound could strengthen bullish sentiment, depending on broader market dynamics and US economic indicators.

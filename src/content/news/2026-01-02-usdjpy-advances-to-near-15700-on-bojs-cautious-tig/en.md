The USD/JPY currency pair continues its upward trajectory, trading around 157.00 for the fourth consecutive day during the early European session on Friday. This strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen is largely attributed to the Bank of Japan’s (BoJ) cautious approach to monetary tightening, which has created a less favorable environment for the yen.

This ongoing trend highlights the implications of central bank policies on currency valuations, with the USD gaining an edge in the current market dynamics.

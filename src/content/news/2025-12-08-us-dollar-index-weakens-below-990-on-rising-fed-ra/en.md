The US Dollar Index (DXY) has slipped below the key level of 99.0, trading around 98.90 during the Asian trading session on Monday. This decline reflects increasing market expectations for a potential cut in Federal Reserve interest rates, prompting traders to reassess their positions in the USD against a basket of six major currencies.

As bets on a Fed rate cut rise, the dollar shows signs of weakness against several peers, impacting currency pairs such as EUR/USD and GBP/USD. A lower DXY may lead to shifts in exchange rates, as market participants navigate the implications of a softer monetary policy outlook, potentially boosting demand for alternative currencies in the forex market.

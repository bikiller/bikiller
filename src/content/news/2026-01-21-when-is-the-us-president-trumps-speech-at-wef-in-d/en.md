U.S. President Donald Trump is set to address the World Economic Forum in Davos after 13:00 GMT, following a delay caused by a minor electrical issue with Air Force One. Market participants are closely watching this speech for potential implications on the EUR/USD exchange rate, as any remarks regarding U.S. economic policies could influence trading sentiment.

The euro is currently trading against the dollar at around 1.1200, with traders eyeing key technical levels. A hint of optimism from Trump could bolster the USD, pushing the currency pair lower, while any negative commentary may strengthen the euro. As trading volumes fluctuate in anticipation of the speech, volatility in the EUR/USD pair is expected, impacting broader forex market movements.

The AUD/JPY currency pair is trading close to a 16-month high, currently hovering around the exchange rate of 103.20 during Monday's European session. The Australian Dollar's strength is notable as it outperforms other major currencies in anticipation of the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) monetary policy announcement set for Tuesday.

This robust performance reflects market optimism regarding potential policy shifts by the RBA, which could influence the AUD's trajectory against the Japanese Yen. As traders position themselves for the upcoming announcement, the exchange rate movement may attract further attention, particularly if the RBA signals any changes in interest rates or economic outlook, impacting broader forex market dynamics.

Gold (XAU/USD) has seen a slight pullback as traders digest the implications of the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut. Currently trading around $1,900 per ounce, the precious metal is facing resistance as market participants reassess the central bank's cautious monetary policy stance. The Fed's decision has led to a more cautious approach among bulls, impacting the exchange rate and limiting upward momentum.

As investors weigh the potential for further monetary easing against inflationary pressures, gold's recent performance reflects a broader trend in the forex market. The USD continues to fluctuate, influenced by the Fed's actions, while the EUR/USD pair remains in focus as European economic data comes into play. The interplay between these major currency pairs and gold prices marks a critical juncture for traders navigating the current landscape.

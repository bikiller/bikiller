Silver (XAG/USD) soared to a new record high near $66 during the Asian trading session on Wednesday, fueled by disappointing economic indicators from the United States. The weak employment figures, coupled with lackluster Retail Sales and a concerning flash S&P Global Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), have intensified worries about the US economy, prompting traders to seek refuge in the precious metal.

The surge in silver prices reflects a growing sentiment among investors that economic instability could persist, impacting the USD's exchange rate against other currencies like the EUR. As XAG/USD continues its bullish trend, market participants are keeping a close watch on upcoming economic data releases, which could further influence silver's trajectory and overall trading dynamics in the forex market.

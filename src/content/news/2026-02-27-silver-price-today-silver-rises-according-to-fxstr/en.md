Silver (XAG/USD) gained on Friday, trading at $89.64 per troy ounce, up 0.90% from Thursday’s price of $88.84. The precious metal’s movement reflects an uptick in market demand, as investors adjust positions ahead of the weekend. The rise follows a brief consolidation, with silver benefiting from a softer USD and broader risk sentiment in global markets.

The increase in silver’s value aligns with shifting investor sentiment, particularly amid fluctuations in the exchange rate of major currencies like the EUR/USD and USD/JPY. As silver tracks fluctuations in the broader commodities complex, its correlation with the dollar remains a key factor for traders, with the metal poised to continue reacting to global risk sentiment and the potential for further USD weakening.

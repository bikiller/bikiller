During the December policy meeting, European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde announced that key interest rates would remain unchanged, aiming to maintain stability in the eurozone amid ongoing economic uncertainties. This decision influenced the EUR/USD exchange rate, which remained volatile as traders assessed the implications of the ECB's stance on future monetary policy and inflation.

Lagarde addressed questions from the press, emphasizing the ECB's commitment to monitoring economic indicators closely. The decision to keep rates steady has led to increased trading activity in the forex market, particularly for the EUR/USD pair, which is currently hovering around 1.05. Market participants are keenly watching for any signs of future rate adjustments as they gauge the potential impact on the euro's strength against the USD.

The Indian Rupee (INR) is trading relatively flat against the US Dollar (USD), holding steady around 90.80 during Tuesday's afternoon session in India. This marks a slight dip from Monday's low, with little movement observed in the currency pair ahead of the opening of US markets. Traders are awaiting the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes later in the week, which could provide further direction for USD/INR.

Market participants are cautious, with global focus shifting to the upcoming FOMC minutes, which are expected to shed light on the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. The INR's current price action reflects a lack of clear momentum, as the exchange rate remains near a key technical level. Any significant movements in the USD could push the INR towards either side of its current range, dependent on the market's interpretation of the US central bank's policy outlook.

The US Dollar (USD) remains steady around 97 in Thursday’s American session, holding its ground ahead of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. The USD’s resilience is being supported by the broader market's cautious sentiment, with traders awaiting inflation data to guide the next moves in forex trading. The EUR/USD pair sees moderate fluctuations, trading near 1.0630, as investors adjust their positions in anticipation of further economic cues.

Meanwhile, Wall Street experienced a sharp decline, driven by renewed concerns over artificial intelligence (AI). Fears that the tech sector may struggle to generate substantial profits in the near term weighed heavily on stock prices, with major indices posting losses. This downturn in equities is contributing to a mixed risk appetite in the currency market, as traders continue to weigh the impact of economic data and market volatility on the USD's performance.

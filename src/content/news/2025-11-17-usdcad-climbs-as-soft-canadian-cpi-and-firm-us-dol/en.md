The Canadian Dollar (CAD) is under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) as the USD/CAD currency pair rises modestly, currently trading around 1.4040. This uptick follows the release of Canada’s October Consumer Price Index (CPI), which revealed softer inflation data. The weaker inflation figures have contributed to a bearish sentiment surrounding the Loonie.

Additionally, a firm US Dollar is amplifying the downward pressure on the CAD. As traders react to the contrasting economic signals between the US and Canada, the exchange rate reflects a cautious outlook for the Canadian economy. The ongoing strength of the Greenback further complicates the Loonie's position, highlighting the impact of macroeconomic indicators on currency trading dynamics.

The GBP/JPY currency pair encountered resistance near the 208.00 mark on Wednesday, following a brief uptick in response to disappointing UK inflation data. The weaker-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures prompted traders to reassess their positions, leading to a decline that pushed the exchange rate to a fresh daily low.

This slide reflects broader market concerns over the UK economic outlook, as the softer inflation data raises questions about the Bank of England's monetary policy trajectory. As GBP/JPY continues to navigate these levels, market participants will closely monitor any further developments in economic indicators that could influence trading sentiment and impact the exchange rate in the coming sessions.

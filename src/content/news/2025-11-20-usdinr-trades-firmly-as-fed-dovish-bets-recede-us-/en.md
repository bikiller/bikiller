The Indian Rupee (INR) opened lower against the US Dollar (USD) on Thursday, with the USD/INR currency pair climbing to approximately 88.85. This movement follows the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes from the October policy meeting, which revealed a shift in market sentiment as dovish bets on the Fed's monetary policy receded.

As the USD outperformed its peers, traders are now awaiting the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) data, which is expected to provide further direction for the exchange rate. With the Fed’s stance becoming more hawkish, market participants will be closely monitoring how these developments could influence the USD/INR trading dynamics in the near term.

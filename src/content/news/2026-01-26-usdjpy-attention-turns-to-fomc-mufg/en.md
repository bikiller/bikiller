The USD/JPY started the week at 157.57, experiencing a dip as the US dollar came under pressure amid escalating tensions between the US and Europe. This early weakness in the currency pair reflected broader market concerns, with investors seeking safer assets. However, the pair quickly regained momentum, climbing to around 158, fueled by increased overseas investor interest and a rise in US Treasury yields.

The recovery in USD/JPY comes as market participants look ahead to the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with expectations that any hints of tighter monetary policy could further support the dollar. As the exchange rate hovers near the 158 level, traders remain focused on the potential implications of the FOMC's stance, which could trigger additional volatility in the currency pair's short-term outlook.

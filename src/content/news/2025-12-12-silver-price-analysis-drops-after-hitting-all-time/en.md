Silver prices have experienced a significant drop following their recent all-time high (ATH) of $64.65, retreating 2.75% as investors locked in profits ahead of the weekend. The current exchange rate for the XAG/USD currency pair stands at $61.84. This decline reflects ongoing uncertainty in the market as Federal Reserve officials express differing opinions on future monetary policy.

The retracement comes amid a backdrop of mixed signals regarding U.S. interest rates, which has kept traders cautious. As silver's momentum shifts, market participants are closely monitoring developments that could influence the next steps for monetary policy. The fluctuations in silver prices highlight the delicate balance traders must navigate in the current forex landscape, particularly between the influence of the USD and broader economic indicators.

The oil market faces renewed pressure as optimism grows for a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine, according to ING’s commodity analysts Ewa Manthey and Warren Patterson. This potential resolution could significantly impact energy prices, which have already shown volatility amid geopolitical tensions. As oil prices fluctuate, traders are closely monitoring the situation, weighing the effects on the USD and other currency pairs.

In the forex market, these developments could influence exchange rates, particularly for the EUR/USD and USD/JPY pairs. A stabilization in oil prices may lead to shifts in trading strategies, as investors reassess risk and potential gains. The energy sector's performance remains critical, with many traders eyeing key technical levels for further insights into future market movements.

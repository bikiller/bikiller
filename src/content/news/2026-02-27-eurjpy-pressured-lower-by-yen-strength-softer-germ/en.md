EUR/JPY dropped to around 184.00 on Friday, marking a 0.10% decline and continuing its second consecutive drop. The pair is under pressure as the Japanese Yen (JPY) strengthens following the release of mixed inflation data from Tokyo. Traders are reacting to the implications of this data on Japan's economic outlook, with a more resilient Yen adding downward pressure to the euro.

The softer-than-expected German inflation figures also contribute to EUR/JPY's decline, as market participants reassess the European Central Bank's tightening path. With the exchange rate slipping below key technical levels, attention now shifts to upcoming data and policy moves from both the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, which could further influence the EUR/JPY outlook in the short term.

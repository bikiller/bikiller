WTI crude oil prices have gained momentum, trading at $63.75 during the Asian session on Wednesday, following a significant geopolitical event. The increase comes after the United States downed an Iranian drone, escalating tensions in the region. This move has sparked concerns over potential disruptions to oil supply, pushing crude prices higher.

USD/KRW has seen downward pressure, driven by a combination of Dollar weakness, a stronger JPY, and increased risk appetite. The exchange rate has dropped as investors are drawn to the South Korean equity market, with the KOSPI outperforming its regional peers. This shift in sentiment has contributed to a reduction in demand for the USD, pushing the currency pair lower.

Foreign inflows into Korean stocks have been significant, further bolstering the KRW's strength. Analysts from OCBC, Sim Moh Siong and Christopher Wong, highlight that these flows have supported the Korean won, amplifying the downside risks for USD/KRW. As these inflows continue, the exchange rate could face further downward pressure, reflecting a broader shift toward pro-risk sentiment in the market.

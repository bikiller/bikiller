EUR/USD continues to struggle as it pulls back from recent highs, currently trading around 1.1560. The currency pair's decline follows a series of mixed economic reports from the Eurozone, which have left traders uncertain ahead of the crucial preliminary German inflation data. This report is expected to provide further insights into the region's economic health and could impact the euro's performance against the USD.

Market participants are closely watching the inflation figures, which could influence the European Central Bank's monetary policy direction. As the exchange rate fluctuates, the focus remains on how the upcoming data will affect trading strategies and the broader sentiment toward the euro versus the dollar. With the immediate outlook on German inflation, volatility in EUR/USD is likely to persist.

Silver (XAG/USD) continues to face challenges despite a recent recovery from last week's low of $64.00, its weakest point since December 17. The price is currently struggling to maintain upward momentum and is trading near $82.25. Despite an initial attempt to bounce back, silver remains under pressure, with bulls hesitant to push the price higher at this stage.

The sluggish movement in XAG/USD can be attributed to broader market sentiment, where the strengthening USD is dampening demand for silver. As the greenback remains supported by rising U.S. Treasury yields, silver bulls are finding it difficult to maintain control, especially with economic uncertainty lingering. Investors will closely monitor upcoming data for potential catalysts to shift the market's direction.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) climbed to approximately $4,670 during the early Asian trading session on Tuesday, as safe-haven demand surged following the implementation of tariffs by former President Trump. The ongoing geopolitical tensions and shaky economic outlook are leading investors to seek refuge in precious metals, pushing the gold price closer to a new all-time high.

As traders react to the uncertain market conditions, the exchange rate for gold continues to reflect heightened risk aversion. The increasing interest in gold could signal further depreciation of the USD against other currencies like the EUR, as market participants navigate the implications of the tariffs on global trade dynamics. The bullish momentum in gold suggests that significant price levels may soon be tested, with traders closely monitoring developments that could influence the demand for safe-haven assets.

The USD/JPY exchange rate has surged to 155.45 as traders increasingly anticipate a 25 basis points interest rate hike from the Bank of Japan (BOJ) on December 19. This upward momentum is fueled by expectations of fiscal stimulus and projected increases in Japanese wage growth, which are driving demand for the Japanese yen against the dollar.

Despite the current rise in the USD/JPY pair, analysts at BBH suggest that fair value indicates a potential long-term adjustment towards 140. This perspective highlights the volatility in the forex market, as traders navigate the implications of central bank policies and economic indicators on currency values. The ongoing shifts in market sentiment continue to shape trading strategies in this key currency pair.

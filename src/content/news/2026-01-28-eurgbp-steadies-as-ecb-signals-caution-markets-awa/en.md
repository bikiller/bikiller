EUR/GBP remains largely unchanged on Wednesday, trading around 0.8690 as market sentiment stays cautious. The currency pair has shown little movement, reflecting subdued trading conditions driven by a light economic calendar in both the UK and the Eurozone. Investors are waiting for fresh data from the Eurozone to guide their next moves.

The European Central Bank's recent cautious stance on monetary policy has further contributed to the lack of clear direction in EUR/GBP. As traders monitor the upcoming Eurozone economic reports, the pair’s outlook remains uncertain. With no major events expected in the near term, market participants continue to stay on the sidelines, watching for any signs of volatility in the exchange rate.

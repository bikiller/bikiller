The EUR/USD currency pair has strengthened to around 1.1645 during the early European session on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations of a US interest rate cut announced on Wednesday. This speculation has led to a weakened US Dollar (USD), allowing the Euro (EUR) to gain traction against its counterpart.

Strong German economic data has further supported the Euro's advance, highlighting the resilience of the Eurozone's largest economy. As traders adjust their positions ahead of the Federal Reserve's decision, the exchange rate movement reflects a broader sentiment that could influence trading strategies in the coming days.

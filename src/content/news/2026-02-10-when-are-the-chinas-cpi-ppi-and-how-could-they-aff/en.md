China's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) will release its January data at 01:30 GMT, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Analysts expect a modest rise of 0.4% year-on-year, down from 0.8% in December. This softer CPI could signal a cooling inflationary environment, which may influence market sentiment and affect the AUD/USD exchange rate, as traders often watch Chinese data closely for signs of economic health.

The release will also include the Producer Price Index (PPI), which could provide further insight into price pressures within China’s manufacturing sector. A lower-than-expected CPI could weigh on the Australian dollar, particularly if it indicates weaker demand from China, Australia’s largest trading partner. Traders may look to the AUD/USD pair for potential volatility, as market expectations shift based on these economic figures.

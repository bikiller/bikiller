GBP/USD is experiencing a modest rise, hovering around 1.3500 during the European session on Friday. Despite this slight uptick, the currency pair remains capped by the 20-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA), which continues to act as a significant resistance level. This key technical indicator has limited upward momentum, keeping the price action constrained for now.

Looking ahead, further downside movement appears likely if GBP/USD drops below 1.3430. A breach of this support could lead to additional declines, with potential for further weakness in the Pound against the US Dollar. Traders will be closely monitoring the pair’s ability to maintain its position above this level, as a break could shift the short-term bias to the downside.

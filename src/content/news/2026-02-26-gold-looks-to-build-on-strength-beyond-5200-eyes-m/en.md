Gold (XAU/USD) surged to a fresh daily high as the European session approached on Thursday, with bulls aiming to push prices above the key $5,200 level. The precious metal’s rally is supported by safe-haven flows, as investors flock to gold amid ongoing market uncertainty. This price action sets the stage for potential further gains, eyeing the monthly peak.

The strength of gold has been bolstered by persistent risk aversion in the broader markets, leading to increased demand for non-yielding assets. As the USD remains under pressure, gold traders are closely monitoring the $5,200 resistance, with a potential breakout signaling a shift in the broader trading sentiment. Gold's upward momentum could extend if the market continues to favor stability over risk.

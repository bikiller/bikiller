EUR/USD remains under pressure, trading at 1.1685 as traders await the latest US jobs figures. The currency pair continues to exhibit a bearish trend, maintaining its downward momentum since reaching December highs. Market participants are closely monitoring economic indicators that could impact the exchange rate.

The current trading conditions reflect a cautious sentiment in the forex market, with the focus shifting towards upcoming employment data. A weaker labor report could further weigh on the USD, potentially leading to a shift in the EUR/USD exchange rate dynamics as investors adjust their positions in anticipation of future trends.

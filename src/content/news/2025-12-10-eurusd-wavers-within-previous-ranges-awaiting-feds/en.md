EUR/USD is currently trading around the 1.1630 mark after a recent pullback from session highs near 1.1660. The currency pair has surrendered most of the gains achieved during early trading in the European session, reflecting a cautious market sentiment. Traders are largely sidelined, closely monitoring developments ahead of the US Federal Reserve's upcoming monetary policy decision.

The exchange rate's fluctuations highlight the market's anticipation and uncertainty as investors await guidance from the Fed. This decision could significantly influence the USD and overall market dynamics. As traders adjust their positions, the EUR/USD pair's movements will be closely scrutinized for potential implications on future trading strategies.

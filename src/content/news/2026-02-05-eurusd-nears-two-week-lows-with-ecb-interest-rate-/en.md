The EUR/USD currency pair is holding steady on Thursday, trading around the 1.1800 level after briefly dipping to 1.1777, its lowest point in two weeks. The Euro has managed to recover slightly but remains under pressure ahead of the European Central Bank’s (ECB) upcoming interest rate decision. Market participants are closely watching for any signals on future monetary policy.

The exchange rate between the EUR and USD is being heavily influenced by expectations surrounding the ECB’s stance on inflation and economic recovery. With the decision looming, traders are anticipating potential volatility, as the outcome could either strengthen or weaken the Euro depending on the ECB's approach to tightening or maintaining current rates.

EUR/GBP is holding steady against the British Pound (GBP) on Thursday, as growing expectations of interest rate cuts by the Bank of England (BoE) put downward pressure on the Pound. The currency pair is trading at 0.8737, slightly easing after testing the 0.8750 level earlier in the session. The market sentiment remains cautious, reflecting the shift in investor focus towards potential monetary easing from the BoE.

The weakening of GBP is attributed to weaker-than-expected UK economic data, further fueling bets that the BoE may reduce rates in the near future. As EUR/GBP maintains its firm position, traders are closely monitoring any signals from the central bank regarding its future policy stance. If the exchange rate sustains above 0.8730, it could suggest further upside potential for the Euro.

USD/JPY is facing pressure as trading begins this week, with the exchange rate hovering defensively above the key level of 154.50. The Japanese Yen (JPY) bulls are gaining strength, buoyed by hawkish signals from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which have shifted market sentiment. This development suggests a potential shift in the balance of power within the currency pair.

Despite the recent weakening momentum for the USD, bulls are maintaining control, aiming to hold above the 154.50 mark. Traders are closely monitoring economic indicators and central bank communications, as any further hawkish moves from the BoJ could solidify JPY's position against the USD. The market's focus remains on how these dynamics will influence future trading patterns in the USD/JPY pair.

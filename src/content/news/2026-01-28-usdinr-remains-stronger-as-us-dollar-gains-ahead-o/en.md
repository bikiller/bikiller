The USD/INR currency pair edged higher in early trading after slipping 0.25% in the previous session, as the exchange rate found support from renewed US Dollar strength. The rebound comes as market participants position cautiously ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy decision, prompting defensive USD demand across major and emerging market currencies.

USD/INR is gradually pushing back toward its record high of 91.96, last seen on January 23, highlighting the persistent bullish bias in the pair. The stronger US Dollar has weighed on risk-sensitive assets, limiting downside potential for USD/INR despite intermittent profit-taking. Trading activity remains measured, with investors reluctant to take aggressive positions before key policy signals.

The Fed’s interest rate outlook continues to dominate forex sentiment, influencing capital flows and relative yield expectations. A hawkish tone could further underpin the USD and keep USD/INR elevated, while any dovish surprise may trigger short-term corrections. For now, the currency pair’s resilience suggests ongoing pressure on the Indian Rupee, with traders closely watching technical levels and broader USD trends across the forex market.

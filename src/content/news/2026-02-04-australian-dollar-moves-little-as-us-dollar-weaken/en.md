The Australian Dollar (AUD) showed minimal movement against the US Dollar (USD) on Wednesday, following a notable 1% gain in the previous session. The AUD/USD pair remained steady, trading around its recent levels as traders awaited upcoming data. Despite a stronger US Dollar earlier in the week, the Australian Dollar held its ground as market sentiment focused on global economic indicators.

Support for the AUD came from China’s Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which rose to 52.3 in January from 52.0 in December, signaling steady economic growth in the region. The upbeat PMI data helped stabilize the AUD/USD pair, even as the US Dollar weakened ahead of the release of the ISM Services PMI, which could provide further clues on the US economy’s performance. Traders are keeping a close eye on this data for potential trading signals.

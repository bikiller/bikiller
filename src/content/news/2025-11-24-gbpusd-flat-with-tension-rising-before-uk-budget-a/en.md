The GBP/USD currency pair is trading flat at approximately 1.3088 during the North American session, reflecting a cautious market as traders anticipate the upcoming UK budget. This period of subdued trading comes amidst a shortened week due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, leading to a wait-and-see approach among investors.

Tensions are rising as the market shifts its focus to significant US economic data scheduled for release soon. The interplay between the UK budget implications and US data could lead to volatility in the exchange rate, impacting both the GBP and USD. Market participants are closely monitoring this dynamic, as fluctuations may create trading opportunities in the near term.

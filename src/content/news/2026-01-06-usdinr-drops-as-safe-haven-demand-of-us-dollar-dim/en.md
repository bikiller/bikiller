The Indian Rupee (INR) has rebounded against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, breaking a three-day losing streak. The USD/INR currency pair corrected to approximately 90.35 as traders reacted to a sharp decline in the US Dollar Index (DXY), which fell to a fresh three-week low of 98.86 on Monday. This decrease reflects a waning demand for the safe-haven USD amid shifting market sentiments.

As the exchange rate stabilizes, the INR's positive performance signals a potential shift in investor confidence. The recent fluctuations in the DXY indicate broader market dynamics, influencing trading strategies and positioning in the forex market. Traders will be closely monitoring further developments in both currencies to gauge future movements in the USD/INR pair and assess any emerging trends that could impact the exchange rate.

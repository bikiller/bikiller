The AUD/JPY currency pair fell to approximately 103.15 in early European trading on Monday, reflecting the Australian Dollar's weakness against the Japanese Yen. This downturn follows disappointing economic indicators from China, where Retail Sales and industrial output growth for November significantly underperformed expectations, heightening concerns over the region's economic outlook.

Despite this decline, the bullish sentiment around the AUD/JPY exchange rate remains intact near the 103.00 level. Traders are closely monitoring the implications of China's slowdown, particularly as it may impact broader market dynamics and risk appetite. As the situation develops, investors will be keen to see whether the Australian economy can withstand external pressures or if further losses are on the horizon for the AUD.

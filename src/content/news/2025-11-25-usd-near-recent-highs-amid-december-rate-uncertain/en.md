The US Dollar (USD) is currently trading near recent highs, with the Dollar Index (DXY) at 100.18. Despite this elevated position, the currency has struggled to gain further traction amid ongoing uncertainty regarding the outcome of the Federal Reserve's December meeting. Market sentiments remain volatile as traders weigh potential rate adjustments against prevailing economic indicators.

Analysts from OCBC, Frances Cheung and Christopher Wong, highlight that this hesitation in the USD could influence major currency pairs, including the EUR/USD. As traders navigate the complexities of upcoming monetary policy decisions, movements in the exchange rate could reflect shifts in sentiment towards U.S. economic stability and interest rate expectations.

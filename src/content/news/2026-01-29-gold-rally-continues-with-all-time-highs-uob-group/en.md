Gold extended its powerful rally, surging to fresh all-time highs above $5,500 per ounce as broad USD weakness dominated trading conditions. A softer US dollar exchange rate across major currency pairs, including EUR/USD and USD/JPY, improved the appeal of non-yielding assets, while safe-haven demand remained firm amid shifting global macro expectations, according to UOB Global Economics & Markets Research.

The move was underpinned by growing market conviction that the Federal Reserve is approaching another phase of monetary easing. Traders increasingly price in lower US interest rates, pressuring the USD and supporting gold across spot and derivatives trading. As the greenback lost momentum, bullion benefited from both speculative inflows and strategic portfolio reallocation away from dollar-denominated assets.

From a market perspective, gold’s break above previous resistance levels reinforces the bullish technical structure, with momentum indicators still favoring upside continuation. The sustained rally also reflects spillover effects from forex markets, where USD softness versus the EUR and other majors continues to reshape cross-asset positioning. UOB notes that as long as USD weakness persists, gold is likely to remain well supported.

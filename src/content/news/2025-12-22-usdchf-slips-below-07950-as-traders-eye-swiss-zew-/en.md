The USD/CHF currency pair has dipped below the key technical level of 0.7950, currently trading around 0.7940 during the Asian trading session on Monday. This decline reflects the US Dollar's ongoing struggles as traders await the crucial release of the third-quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data on Tuesday, which is expected to influence market sentiment and the exchange rate.

As market participants eye the Swiss ZEW survey alongside the US GDP figures, the recent gains of the USD against the Swiss Franc (CHF) have been partially reversed. The anticipation surrounding these economic indicators is likely to drive volatility in the forex market, with analysts closely monitoring the potential impacts on the USD/CHF exchange rate in the days ahead.

Bank of England (BoE) MPC member Alan Taylor addressed the current pace of inflation normalization in the UK during a fireside chat at Deutsche Bank in London on Monday. Taylor noted that UK services inflation has moderated, though not as quickly as anticipated. The BoE is proceeding with its inflation control strategy at a measured pace, signaling that further tightening may be necessary to ensure stability.

The market responded with slight fluctuations in the GBP/USD exchange rate, as Taylor's comments added caution to the trading atmosphere. The pair saw some resistance around the 1.2150 level, with a potential to test lower levels if the inflation cooling remains slower than expected. Euro traders also monitored these remarks closely, impacting the EUR/GBP as it tested 0.8700 support. The BoE’s approach could influence trading dynamics in the coming weeks, particularly if inflation proves more stubborn.

The Euro began the first full week of 2026 on a weak note, trading lower against a stronger Japanese Yen. The EUR/JPY currency pair has seen a notable reversal from last Friday’s high of 184.40, now approaching two-week lows at 183.30. This decline reflects broader Euro weakness as traders assess economic conditions in the Eurozone.

Market sentiment has shifted, with the Japanese Yen gaining traction amid a more resilient overall performance. As the exchange rate tests the critical support level of 183.30, traders will be closely monitoring for signs of further movement in the pair, especially as it navigates through this recent trading range. The implications for the Euro may be significant if downward pressure persists, potentially impacting broader market dynamics.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) is maintaining its gains against the US Dollar (USD), trading around the 1.3470 level during the European session on Tuesday. This stability comes as traders position themselves ahead of the highly anticipated US Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for December, set to be released at 13:30 GMT. 

Market sentiment remains cautious, with the GBP/USD currency pair showing resilience as investors await insights into inflation trends in the US. A significant shift in the exchange rate could occur based on the CPI results, impacting the broader forex landscape and influencing future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve.

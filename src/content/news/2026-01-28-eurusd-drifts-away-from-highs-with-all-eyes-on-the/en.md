The EUR/USD currency pair has retreated from its recent highs, trading at 1.1965 as of Wednesday after reaching a peak of 1.2082 on Tuesday, a level not seen in over four years. This pullback highlights the market's cautious sentiment ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions, which are expected to influence the USD's performance.

Traders are closely monitoring the Fed's stance on interest rates, which could significantly impact the exchange rate. The softening of the Euro might indicate profit-taking after a strong rally, but the overall outlook remains tied to the Fed's monetary policy signals. As market participants await clearer direction, fluctuations in the EUR/USD exchange rate are likely to persist.

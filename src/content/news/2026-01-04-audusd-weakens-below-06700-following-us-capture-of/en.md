The AUD/USD currency pair has seen a decline, weakening below the 0.6700 mark as it trades around 0.6685 during the early Asian session on Monday. This movement reflects heightened selling pressure on the Australian Dollar (AUD), fueled by a rise in geopolitical tensions following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. 

The increased uncertainty has shifted traders’ preferences towards safe-haven assets, particularly the U.S. Dollar (USD), resulting in a stronger exchange rate against the AUD. Market participants are closely monitoring developments that could further impact risk sentiment and influence trading strategies in the days ahead.

The forex market is poised for significant movement today as traders anticipate the release of the US GDP data, which is expected to influence currency pairs ahead of the holiday season. Currently, the EUR/USD exchange rate is holding at 1.1300, reflecting a cautious sentiment among investors. A stronger-than-expected GDP report could bolster the USD, pushing the currency pair towards key support levels at 1.1250.

Meanwhile, the GBP/USD pair is trading at 1.3700, showing resilience amid mixed market signals. Analysts suggest that if the GDP data reveals robust economic growth, the dollar may gain further traction, impacting trading strategies. Traders should closely monitor any fluctuations, as volatility is likely to increase as we approach year-end holiday trading.

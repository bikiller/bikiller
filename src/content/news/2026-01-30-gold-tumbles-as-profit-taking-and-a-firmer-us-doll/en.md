Gold prices slide sharply as XAU/USD faces heavy selling pressure, erasing all gains made earlier in the week. Heightened volatility across global markets has triggered widespread liquidation of leveraged positions, accelerating the downside move. The stronger US Dollar adds to the pressure, as the USD exchange rate firms against major currency pairs, reducing the appeal of non-yielding assets in active trading.

Profit-taking has also played a central role, with traders locking in gains after gold failed to sustain elevated levels. As the USD outperforms peers such as the EUR, demand for gold weakens, reflecting shifting risk sentiment. The move highlights how sensitive XAU/USD remains to fluctuations in the US Dollar and broader forex market dynamics.

From a market perspective, the pullback underscores the fragile balance between safe-haven demand and currency-driven flows. With EUR/USD and other major pairs reacting to expectations around US monetary policy, gold trading may remain volatile. Further strength in the USD could keep pressure on prices, while sustained turbulence may revive defensive positioning.

The EUR/USD currency pair is poised for a potential decline to 1.1585, as analysts from UOB Group, Quek Ser Leang and Lee Sue Ann, suggest that stabilization may not occur until this level is reached. They emphasize that the major support level at 1.1560 is unlikely to be breached in the near term, indicating a temporary floor for the euro against the dollar.

In the broader context, the analysts foresee a resumption of the euro's weakness, with the possibility of further declines towards 1.1560. Traders should brace for volatility as market dynamics shift, impacting exchange rates and presenting opportunities for strategic trading in response to these movements in the EUR/USD pair.

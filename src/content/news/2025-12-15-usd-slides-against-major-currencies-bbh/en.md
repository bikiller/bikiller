The US Dollar (USD) is currently under pressure against major currencies, reflecting a defensive trading stance. Analysts indicate that the USD could drift toward the lower end of its trading range established from June to December. This shift comes amid fluctuating investor sentiment and market uncertainties that have influenced currency pairs.

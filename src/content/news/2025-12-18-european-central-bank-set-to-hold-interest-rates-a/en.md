The European Central Bank (ECB) is set to conclude its final two-day meeting of the year on Thursday, with key market expectations surrounding its interest rate decision. Amid steady inflation rates and moderated economic growth, analysts predict that the ECB will maintain its current interest rates. This decision could influence the EUR/USD exchange rate as traders assess the central bank’s stance amid ongoing economic conditions in the Eurozone.

As the market anticipates the ECB's announcement, the EUR is likely to experience volatility against major currency pairs, including the USD. Investors are closely monitoring technical levels, with resistance seen at 1.0500 and support around 1.0400. The outcome of this meeting will be pivotal for forex trading strategies, potentially shaping the trajectory of the euro in response to the ECB’s outlook on inflation and growth.

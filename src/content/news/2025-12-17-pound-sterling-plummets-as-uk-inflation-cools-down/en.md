The Pound Sterling (GBP) is experiencing significant selling pressure against major currency pairs, dropping over 0.7% to approximately 1.3310 against the US Dollar (USD). This decline follows the release of the United Kingdom's Consumer Price Index (CPI) data for November, which indicated a cooling in inflation rates. The market reaction reflects traders' concerns about the implications for the UK's monetary policy.

As GBP struggles to maintain its footing, volatility in the currency markets is expected to increase. The exchange rate dynamics between GBP and the Euro (EUR) may also be affected as investors reassess their positions in light of the new economic data. The current movement in the GBP/USD pair highlights the potential for further fluctuations as traders digest the implications of lower inflation on future interest rate decisions by the Bank of England.

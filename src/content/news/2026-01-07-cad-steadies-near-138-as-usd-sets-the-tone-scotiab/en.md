The Canadian Dollar (CAD) experienced a slight decline in overnight trading but has stabilized around the 1.38 mark as North American markets prepare to open. Scotiabank's Chief FX Strategists, Shaun Osborne and Eric Theoret, note that the CAD's movement is closely aligned with the broader trends set by the U.S. Dollar (USD), which continues to dominate market sentiment.

As traders monitor the exchange rate, the CAD's resilience suggests a cautious approach amid a generally subdued trading environment. The implications of the USD's influence may lead to further fluctuations in the CAD, particularly as economic indicators emerge in the coming days. Market participants are advised to stay attuned to developments affecting the USD, as these will likely dictate the future trajectory of the CAD/USD currency pair.

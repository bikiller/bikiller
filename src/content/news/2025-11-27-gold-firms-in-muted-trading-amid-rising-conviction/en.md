Gold (XAU/USD) remains stable during the North American session on Thursday, trading at $4,158 as US markets observe the Thanksgiving holiday. The low-volume environment has resulted in muted trading activity, with little movement in the exchange rate. Investors are increasingly anticipating potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, contributing to the precious metal's firm stance.

With market participants cautious in the face of holiday closures, the lack of significant news has left gold largely unchanged. This stability indicates a level of investor confidence in gold as a hedge against economic uncertainty, particularly as discussions around the Fed’s monetary policy continue to evolve. As trading resumes, fluctuations in the currency pair could be influenced by upcoming economic data and shifts in market sentiment regarding the USD.

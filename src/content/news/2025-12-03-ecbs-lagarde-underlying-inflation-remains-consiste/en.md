European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde emphasized the stability of underlying inflation during her testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament in Brussels. She noted that economic growth is expected to gain momentum, driven by increased household spending and a robust labor market, which could influence trading dynamics in the EUR/USD currency pair.

As the markets digest Lagarde's remarks, traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate fluctuations. The ECB's positive outlook may bolster the euro, potentially pushing the EUR/USD pair higher as investor confidence grows. However, any signs of economic strain could prompt volatility, affecting trading strategies and positioning ahead of upcoming monetary policy decisions.

The USD/JPY currency pair experienced a notable decline on Thursday, trading at approximately 155.10, down 0.50% for the day. This drop comes amid rising U.S. jobless claims, which have fueled concerns about the strength of the U.S. labor market and its potential impact on economic growth.

As traders closely monitor the situation, speculation surrounding a possible rate hike by the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is intensifying.

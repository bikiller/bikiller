The USD/JPY currency pair steadied on Thursday, consolidating around the 153.00 mark after finding support in the lower 152.00s. The US Dollar regained traction as expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve easing continued to fade, underpinning the exchange rate. Reduced bets on near-term rate cuts have reinforced USD demand, allowing the pair to stabilize after recent volatility in trading.

Market participants have scaled back projections for swift monetary policy loosening, lending the Greenback broader support across major currency pairs, including EUR/USD. Higher US yields have also contributed to the firmer tone in USD/JPY, keeping the pair comfortably above the 152.00 threshold. The 153.00 level now acts as an immediate pivot, with traders closely monitoring price action for directional cues.

For the Japanese Yen, persistent yield differentials remain a headwind, limiting upside despite occasional safe-haven flows. As long as Fed easing expectations remain restrained, the USD is likely to stay supported, keeping the exchange rate biased to the upside. A sustained move above 153.00 could encourage further bullish trading momentum in the near term.

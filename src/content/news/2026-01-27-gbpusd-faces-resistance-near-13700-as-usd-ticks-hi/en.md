The GBP/USD currency pair is encountering resistance near the 1.3700 level, struggling to maintain its gains for a second consecutive day. As the early European session unfolds on Tuesday, the exchange rate has begun to edge lower, reflecting the slight uptick in USD strength ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve rate decision.

Market participants are closely watching the Fed's stance on interest rates, as any signals of tightening could bolster the dollar further. The recent fluctuations in GBP/USD highlight the ongoing volatility in the forex market, with traders weighing the impact of U.S. monetary policy against expectations for the British economy. The pair's performance around the 1.3700 threshold could set the tone for potential trading strategies in the near term.

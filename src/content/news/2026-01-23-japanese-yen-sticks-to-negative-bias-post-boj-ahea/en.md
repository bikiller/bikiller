The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues to trade with a negative bias following the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) decision to maintain its short-term interest rates, as expected. Traders are now focusing on the upcoming press conference by BoJ Governor Ueda, hoping for clues on the timeline for any future policy tightening. The USD/JPY remains elevated, holding near recent highs as the market awaits further direction.

With the BoJ sticking to its accommodative stance, the Yen's weakness is apparent across major currency pairs. The EUR/JPY has also shown upward momentum, reflecting the broader trend of JPY underperformance. As expectations for rate hikes in other economies, especially the US, continue to drive the USD's strength, the Yen struggles to regain ground, leaving traders cautious for the time being.

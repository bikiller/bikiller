GBP/USD has shown notable upward movement, climbing towards 1.3460 as traders increasingly adopt a 'Sell America' strategy. This trend follows President Donald Trump’s recent escalation of trade tensions with Europe, prompting a sell-off of the US Dollar and various US assets. 

The weakening of the USD is reflected in the exchange rate, as market participants react to the implications of heightened trade conflicts. As the GBP gains traction, the currency pair's movement suggests a shift in investor sentiment, potentially leading to further volatility in the forex market as traders reassess their positions amid ongoing geopolitical developments.

The release of the Federal Reserve's December meeting minutes is set to be a pivotal event this week, particularly after the central bank's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points. This move has contributed to the stabilization of the USD, currently trading against the EUR at an exchange rate of 1.0850. Traders are keenly anticipating further insights on future rate cuts, especially the indication of another potential reduction in 2026.

Meanwhile, gold prices have taken a hit, slipping to $1,912 per ounce as the strengthened USD diminishes the allure of the precious metal. Market participants are closely monitoring these developments, as shifts in the Fed's monetary policy and interest rates can significantly impact currency pairs and overall trading strategies. The outcome of the Fed minutes could set the tone for the USD and gold in the coming weeks.

Deutsche Bank Research has emphasized the strategic importance of the newly concluded India-EU Free Trade Agreement (FTA), predicting a significant boost to the Indian economy. The deal promises enhanced market access for Indian businesses in Europe, potentially improving the INR’s position against major currencies. With the increased economic ties, analysts foresee potential strength in the INR, influencing key currency pairs like EUR/INR and USD/INR. 

In the short term, the FTA could drive trading momentum, particularly in the EUR/INR pair, as Europe becomes a crucial trade partner for India. This shift could impact the EUR’s exchange rate, especially if the deal leads to stronger demand for Indian goods and services. As markets digest the long-term implications of the agreement, traders will closely monitor INR performance and its influence on broader forex trends.

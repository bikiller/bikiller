The Australian Dollar (AUD) gained momentum against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, driven by the positive release of Australia's TD-MI Inflation Gauge. The gauge rose to 3.5% year-over-year (YoY) in December, an increase from the previous 3.2%, indicating a strengthening economic backdrop that supports the AUD.

As Australia’s economy shows resilience, traders are closely monitoring the AUD/USD exchange rate for further movement. The robust inflation data could influence future monetary policy decisions by the Reserve Bank of Australia, enhancing the AUD's appeal in the forex market. This upward trend reflects broader market confidence in Australia's economic recovery, particularly following China's fourth-quarter expansion.

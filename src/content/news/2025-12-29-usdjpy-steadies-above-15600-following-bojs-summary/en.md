The USD/JPY currency pair is showing signs of stability above the 156.00 level as traders digest the Bank of Japan’s latest Summary of Opinions. The US Dollar is experiencing a slight decline against a moderately stronger Japanese Yen, maintaining a trading range that keeps the exchange rate just above this critical threshold.

Market sentiment remains cautious, with the USD under pressure as investors weigh economic indicators and central bank signals. Despite the pullback, the dollar remains resilient, and any further movement below 156.00 could trigger increased selling activity, impacting broader forex market dynamics. As the week unfolds, traders will be closely monitoring developments that could influence the USD/JPY exchange rate.

MUFG’s Senior Currency Analyst Lloyd Chan forecasts continued downward pressure on the USD/MYR currency pair, predicting the exchange rate will trend lower towards 3.7000 by the end of 2026. This outlook is based on the development of a more stable and long-term Ringgit appreciation cycle, suggesting that Malaysia’s currency will likely maintain strength against the USD over the next few years.

The expected strengthening of the Ringgit is driven by factors such as improved economic fundamentals and market confidence in Malaysia’s recovery. As the USD/MYR moves closer to the 3.7000 level, traders should watch for key signals indicating further weakness in the US Dollar and potential shifts in regional trade dynamics. This trend could present opportunities for those trading the pair in the months ahead.

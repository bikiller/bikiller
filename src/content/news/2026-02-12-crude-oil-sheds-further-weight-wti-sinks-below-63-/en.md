Crude oil prices continued to fall on Thursday, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dipping below $63 per barrel. The decline was driven by heightened concerns over the US-Iran tensions, which raised the possibility of a sharp pullback in oil prices. Additionally, the market's growing skepticism surrounding a major demand surge from China added further pressure, overshadowing expectations for stronger energy consumption.

As a result, the bearish sentiment weighed on the broader market, with the USD gaining ground against other currencies. Oil traders are now closely monitoring geopolitical developments and global demand forecasts. With WTI hovering at lower levels, the outlook remains uncertain, as concerns about a potential economic slowdown in key markets continue to challenge bullish momentum. The EUR/USD exchange rate remained volatile, with investors positioning for any shifts in global sentiment.

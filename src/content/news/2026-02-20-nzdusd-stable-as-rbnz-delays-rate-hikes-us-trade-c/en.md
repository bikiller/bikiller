NZD/USD remained stable around 0.5970 on Friday, showing little change after a brief fluctuation following the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s (RBNZ) decision to delay rate hikes. The currency pair found support near this level as traders digested the RBNZ's cautious stance on monetary tightening amid ongoing uncertainties in the global economy.

The US dollar's mixed performance also played a role in keeping the NZD/USD exchange rate largely unchanged. Concerns surrounding US trade policies continue to weigh on investor sentiment, adding volatility to the broader market. With no immediate changes to New Zealand's interest rates, traders are likely to focus on any future shifts in US economic data or trade developments to drive the pair’s next move.

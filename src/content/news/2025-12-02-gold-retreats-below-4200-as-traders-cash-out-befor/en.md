Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a decline of approximately 0.80% on Tuesday, retreating below the $4,200 mark as traders booked profits ahead of the upcoming Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. The precious metal traded at $4,193, after peaking at $4,240 earlier in the day, influenced by a strengthened US Dollar that has affected various currency pairs in the forex market.

As the Fed meeting approaches, market participants are closely monitoring the exchange rate dynamics and the potential implications for gold prices. The firm USD has created pressure on gold, prompting traders to secure gains before any shifts in US monetary policy could further impact market sentiment. The outcome of the meeting could lead to increased volatility in both gold and broader forex trading markets, particularly against major currencies like the EUR and GBP.

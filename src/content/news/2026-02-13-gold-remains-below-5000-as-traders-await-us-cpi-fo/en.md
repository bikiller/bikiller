Gold (XAU/USD) is holding onto modest intraday gains as the European trading session begins on Friday, remaining just under the critical $5,000 level. Despite minor upward movement, traders are staying cautious ahead of the upcoming release of US consumer price index (CPI) data, which could provide clues about potential Fed rate cuts. Gold’s movement is closely tied to the dollar’s outlook, with the market eyeing any shifts in monetary policy.

The trading environment remains volatile as investors assess the potential impact of the CPI report on US inflation expectations and the Federal Reserve’s next steps. A higher-than-expected CPI could bolster the USD, likely putting additional pressure on gold. Meanwhile, a weaker CPI might fuel hopes for a dovish Fed, potentially lifting demand for gold as a hedge. As XAU/USD struggles below $5,000, the market remains in a holding pattern, awaiting clearer direction from the inflation data.

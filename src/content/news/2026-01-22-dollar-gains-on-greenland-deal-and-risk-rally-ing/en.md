The US Dollar (USD) has rallied as risk appetite returned to the markets, prompted by President Trump's decision to eliminate EU tariffs following a framework deal regarding Greenland. This development is enhancing the attractiveness of the greenback, as it strengthens against other major currencies, particularly the Euro (EUR). Traders are closely monitoring the exchange rate fluctuations, with the USD/EUR pair reflecting this newfound optimism.

However, analysts, including Francesco Pesole from ING, caution that the market remains in a wait-and-see mode. Traders are anticipating further details before making any significant shifts in their trading strategies. The current dynamic creates a complex landscape where the USD could maintain its bullish momentum, depending on upcoming developments that could influence the overall risk sentiment in the forex market.

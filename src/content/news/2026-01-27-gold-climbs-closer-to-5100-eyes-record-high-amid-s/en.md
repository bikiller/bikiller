Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward momentum for the seventh consecutive day, reaching near $5,100 in early European trading. The precious metal remains within striking distance of its all-time high, driven by persistent safe-haven demand amid global uncertainty. As investors seek stability, gold has gained significant ground, reflecting investor caution across markets.

Market participants are also factoring in expectations of a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve, further supporting gold's rise. The outlook for a weaker USD amid such speculation adds to the bullish sentiment. With gold trading close to record levels, traders are keeping a close watch on any developments that could push it toward new highs.

Gold (XAU/USD) is demonstrating resilience as it trades near its record high, maintaining a strong bid tone during the first half of the European session on Wednesday. The precious metal remains in the spotlight as investors seek safe-haven assets amid ongoing global uncertainties, keeping the $4,900 level within reach. This persistent demand for gold highlights its appeal as a hedge against inflation and market volatility.

As traders assess the evolving economic landscape, the exchange rate reflects heightened interest in gold, signaling a shift in market sentiment. With the USD facing pressures from various geopolitical factors, gold's bullish momentum appears likely to continue, potentially leading to further price gains. The ongoing flight to safety underscores the importance of monitoring gold's performance as it navigates this pivotal phase in the market.

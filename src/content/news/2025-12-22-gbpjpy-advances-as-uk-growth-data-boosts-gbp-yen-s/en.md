GBP/JPY is trading at approximately 211.10 on Monday, marking a modest increase of 0.10% for the day. The rise comes amid supportive UK growth data, which has bolstered the British pound as traders respond to the positive economic indicators. 

Meanwhile, the Japanese yen remains steady, benefitting from safe-haven demand. Market activity is somewhat muted, influenced by reduced liquidity due to public holidays in several financial centers. As traders navigate these conditions, the exchange rate of GBP/JPY reflects the dynamic interplay of economic data and risk sentiment in the currency markets.

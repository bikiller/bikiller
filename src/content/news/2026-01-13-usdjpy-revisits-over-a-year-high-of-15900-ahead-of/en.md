The USD/JPY currency pair has surged to a 1.5-year high of 159.00 during the European trading session on Tuesday, reflecting strong demand for the dollar amidst rising market expectations. Traders are closely monitoring this exchange rate ahead of the upcoming US Consumer Price Index (CPI) release, which could provide further direction for the dollar.

This upward movement in the USD/JPY exchange rate underscores the dollar's strength in the forex market, driven by speculation about inflation data and its potential impact on monetary policy. A higher-than-expected CPI could bolster the USD further, while any signs of easing inflation may temper its gains. Market participants remain vigilant as they anticipate the data release, which could lead to heightened volatility in the currency pair.

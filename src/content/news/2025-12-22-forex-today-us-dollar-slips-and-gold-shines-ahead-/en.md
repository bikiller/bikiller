The US Dollar (USD) experienced a retreat, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) slipping to approximately 98.30 following a brief climb to a one-week high last Friday. This decline is attributed to growing expectations for a dovish stance from the Federal Reserve, which is likely to maintain a lenient monetary policy approach through 2026. 

As the USD weakens, gold prices gain traction, shining brightly in the midst of the shifting sentiment. Traders are closely monitoring upcoming key US data releases, which could further influence the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other currencies, particularly the euro (EUR). The market anticipates that these economic indicators may provide insight into the Fed's future policy decisions and overall economic health.

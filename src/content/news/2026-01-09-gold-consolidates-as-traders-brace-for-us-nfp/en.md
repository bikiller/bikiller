Gold (XAU/USD) is holding steady as traders adopt a cautious stance ahead of the highly anticipated US Nonfarm Payrolls (NFP) report, set to be released at 13:30 GMT. Currently, the currency pair is trading around $4,470, showing signs of consolidation after rebounding from the $4,400 level on Thursday. This stability reflects market uncertainty as participants weigh the potential impact of labor market data on future monetary policy.

As the USD remains under scrutiny, fluctuations in the gold market often correlate with shifts in risk sentiment. The upcoming NFP report is expected to influence exchange rates, particularly between the USD and EUR, as investors seek to gauge the health of the US economy. With the gold price hovering near key support levels, traders are keenly monitoring any changes that could signal further volatility in the currency markets.

The GBP/JPY currency pair saw a sharp decline on Thursday, with the British Pound losing 0.36% against the Japanese Yen. Risk-off sentiment drove a surge in demand for the Yen as a safe haven, triggered by renewed fears over AI disruptions that sent Wall Street into a steep decline. This shift in market sentiment pushed investors toward safer assets, benefiting the Yen and weighing on the Pound.

Despite the flight to safety, other traditional haven assets, including Gold, Silver, and the US Dollar, failed to attract significant buying interest. The Pound's weakness in this environment highlights the broader risk aversion, which continues to pressure GBP/JPY prices. Traders will be closely watching upcoming data releases for any signs of reversal or further consolidation in the currency pair, especially if market fears intensify.

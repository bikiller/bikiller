The New Zealand Dollar has shown signs of recovery, trading at approximately 0.5790 against the USD on Monday, marking a 0.60% increase for the day. This rebound comes after the currency pair hit a two-week low of 0.5735 on Friday, indicating some corrective movement in the market.

Despite the uptick, the NZD's upside potential appears limited as traders remain cautious amid broader market sentiments. Fluctuations in the exchange rate reflect ongoing economic developments and investor sentiment, keeping the focus on how the NZD will perform against major currencies like the EUR in the coming sessions.

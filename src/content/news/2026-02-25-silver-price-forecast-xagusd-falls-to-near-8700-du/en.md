Silver (XAG/USD) continues to face downward pressure, slipping to approximately $87.20 per ounce during Asian trading on Wednesday. This marks the second consecutive session of losses for the precious metal, reflecting a broader market trend. The sell-off in silver is largely attributed to liquidation driven by concerns surrounding China’s economic outlook, which has caused a wave of risk-off sentiment across global markets.

The decline in silver has placed it firmly below key support levels, with traders eyeing the $87.00 mark as a potential psychological barrier. The weakening of the Chinese economy has led to a stronger US dollar, putting additional strain on commodity prices. As the USD remains supported by expectations of a hawkish Federal Reserve, silver faces ongoing challenges in regaining upward momentum.

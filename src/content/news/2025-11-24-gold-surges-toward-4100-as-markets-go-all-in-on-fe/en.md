Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a notable surge on Monday, climbing 0.80% as the market anticipates a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming December meeting. This optimism is fueled by the release of recent US economic data, which has contributed to a bullish sentiment among investors. At the time of writing, the exchange rate for XAU/USD stands close to $4,100, after dipping to a low of $4,040 earlier in the session.

The rising price of gold reflects a broader trend as traders adjust their positions in response to expectations surrounding Fed policy. As the market continues to price in these potential cuts, the yellow metal is likely to attract further interest, signaling a shift in sentiment amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Investors are keenly watching how these developments will influence the broader forex landscape, particularly the behavior of the USD against other major currencies like the EUR.

The USD/JPY currency pair is experiencing upward momentum, trading around 155.40 on Tuesday, marking a 0.10% increase for the day and reaching a fresh ten-month high. This rise in the exchange rate is primarily attributed to the Bank of Japan's dovish stance, which is placing significant downward pressure on the yen.

Market participants are closely monitoring upcoming US economic data, which could further influence trading dynamics. As traders assess the implications of the US data releases, the focus remains on how these factors will affect the USD's strength against the yen, particularly in light of the current interest rate environment and the BoJ's policy direction.

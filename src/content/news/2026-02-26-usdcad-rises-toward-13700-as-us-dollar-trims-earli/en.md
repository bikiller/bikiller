The USD/CAD exchange rate rebounded towards 1.3700 on Thursday, as the US Dollar (USD) recovered from its earlier weakness. After reaching a daily low of 1.3659, the pair rose to 1.3704, reflecting the USD's ability to shake off intraday losses. This shift comes amid fluctuating market sentiment as traders weigh recent economic data and central bank policies.

The Canadian Dollar (CAD) briefly gained ground against the USD but faced renewed pressure as the Greenback strengthened. With USD/CAD holding above key support at 1.3650, attention turns to upcoming US economic reports that could influence further price action. Traders will continue to monitor developments, with a focus on potential movements toward 1.3750 or a retreat back to the 1.3650 range.

The AUD/JPY currency pair surged above the mid-108.00s early this week, gaining momentum following Japan's weaker-than-expected Q4 GDP report. The disappointing data dampened expectations for further interest rate hikes by the Bank of Japan (BoJ), contributing to a broad selloff of the Japanese Yen. 

The softer GDP figures led traders to reassess their positions on JPY, as a slowdown in economic growth undermined the currency’s appeal. As a result, the AUD/JPY exchange rate climbed, reflecting investor confidence in the Australian Dollar amidst weakening demand for the Yen. The BoJ’s dovish stance continues to weigh heavily on JPY, with the market likely to remain sensitive to any shifts in Japan’s economic outlook.

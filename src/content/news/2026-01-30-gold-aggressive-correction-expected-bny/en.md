Gold prices are facing an aggressive correction as a sharp shift in U.S. monetary policy expectations strengthens the USD across major currency pairs. According to BNY’s Head of Markets Macro Strategy Bob Savage, the nomination of Kevin Warsh as the next Federal Reserve chair triggered a surge in the U.S. Dollar exchange rate, pressuring precious metals. Gold fell 5.9% in a swift sell-off, reflecting a rapid repricing in global trading conditions.

The stronger USD weighed heavily on the broader metals complex, with Silver and Platinum both recording declines of more than 10%. As the dollar gained ground against counterparts such as the EUR and JPY, investors rotated out of non-yielding assets. Higher real yields and expectations of a more hawkish Fed stance reduced the appeal of Gold as a hedge, accelerating downside momentum and breaking key technical support levels.

From a forex trading perspective, the move underscores how shifts in Fed leadership can ripple through currency markets and commodity pricing. A firmer USD typically pressures Gold prices, particularly when exchange rates favor dollar strength. If USD momentum continues, further downside risks remain for precious metals, while currency pairs linked to risk sentiment may stay volatile in the near term.

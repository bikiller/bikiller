The AUD/USD currency pair is extending its rally, having successfully reclaimed the 200-day moving average and broken through a significant multi-year trend line. This upward momentum has brought the exchange rate closer to the key resistance zone between 0.6685 and 0.6710, according to FX analysts at Société Générale.

The recent movement in the AUD/USD reflects strong bullish sentiment in the market, driven by improved risk appetite among traders. As the Australian dollar strengthens against the USD, traders will be closely monitoring whether the pair can maintain its upward trajectory, potentially paving the way for further gains if resistance levels are surpassed.

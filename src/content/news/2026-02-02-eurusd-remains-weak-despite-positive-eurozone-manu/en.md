EUR/USD remains subdued despite stronger-than-expected Eurozone manufacturing data. As of Monday, the currency pair is trading near 1.1850, showing little reaction to the upward revisions of both Eurozone and German manufacturing activity. The positive economic figures failed to lift the Euro, indicating limited market momentum for the EUR against the USD.

The lack of movement suggests that traders remain cautious, possibly waiting for further catalysts or indications of a shift in sentiment. With the EUR/USD exchange rate lingering around the 1.1850 level, market participants are closely monitoring broader economic developments and the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy, which could provide more direction in the coming days.

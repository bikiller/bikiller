The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is widely expected to announce a 25 basis points rate cut today, bringing the target rate to 3.50-3.75%. With approximately 90% of this move already priced in, traders are closely monitoring the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for insights into future monetary policy. The number of dissenters regarding the cut could also influence market sentiment.

In the wake of this anticipated decision, the USD's performance against major currency pairs like the EUR will be pivotal. Investors will keenly listen to Chair Powell's press conference, which may provide guidance on the central bank's outlook. Any shifts in tone could lead to volatility in exchange rates, impacting trading strategies and positioning in the forex market.

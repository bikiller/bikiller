EUR/USD slipped below the 1.1600 mark for the second consecutive day, trading at 1.1586 with a slight decline of 0.04%. This drop reflects a risk-off sentiment in the market as investors remain cautious ahead of the highly anticipated Nonfarm Payrolls report. The prevailing uncertainty is compounded by upcoming earnings from NVIDIA, which has added to the cautious outlook surrounding the USD.

The stronger demand for the Dollar has resulted from this risk aversion, as traders digest recent labor market data and economic orders. With market participants closely monitoring these developments, the movement in the EUR/USD currency pair highlights the interplay between risk sentiment and economic indicators, suggesting potential volatility ahead as traders position for the NFP report.

GBP/JPY is experiencing a mild negative bias as it trades within a two-week range on Monday. The currency pair's movement is subdued, with thin liquidity attributed to a market holiday in Japan. The absence of significant economic data from the UK also adds to the lack of momentum in the pair. GBP/JPY is currently hovering around the 169.20 level, marking a slight retreat from its recent highs.

As expectations for potential easing from the Bank of England (BoE) continue to grow, the pair remains under pressure. With investors speculating on further rate cuts amid ongoing economic challenges, the GBP struggles to gain traction against the yen. The technical range for GBP/JPY is expected to hold in the short term, with key support seen near 168.50 and resistance at 170.00. The broader market focus remains on developments surrounding the BoE's policy stance and global risk sentiment.

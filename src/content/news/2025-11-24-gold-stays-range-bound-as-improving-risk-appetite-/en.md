Gold (XAU/USD) remains range-bound as the new week commences, with the market showing limited upside potential amid a strengthening risk appetite. Currently trading around $4,076, gold has bounced off an intraday low of approximately $4,040. Investors are closely monitoring the shifting landscape of Federal Reserve monetary policy, which plays a crucial role in shaping market sentiment and influencing the exchange rate.

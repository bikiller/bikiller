The U.S. dollar's outlook remains uncertain as National Bank of Canada economists Ethan Currie and Taylor Schleich warn that the U.S. fiscal trajectory is unsustainable. While recent tariff revenues have provided a temporary boost, the overall fiscal path raises concerns about long-term stability. Despite these challenges, the USD continues to influence major currency pairs, with the EUR/USD exchange rate holding near key support levels.

The outlook for USD trading is complicated by growing deficits and increasing tariffs, which add temporary relief but fail to address underlying fiscal issues. As the U.S. government faces mounting fiscal pressures, the dollar's future strength remains tied to broader economic policies. Traders will closely watch the EUR/USD pair for signs of further weakness in the greenback as the European Central Bank (ECB) potentially adjusts its own monetary stance in response.

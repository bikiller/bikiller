The Australian Dollar (AUD) continues to strengthen against the US Dollar (USD) for the third consecutive session, with the AUD/USD pair hovering around the 0.7100 mark during Asian trading on Monday. This gain comes amid a broader USD weakness, as concerns over tariff uncertainty persist, keeping the greenback under pressure. The ongoing trade uncertainty has weighed heavily on investor sentiment, limiting the USD’s upward momentum against major currencies.

Despite some fluctuations, the AUD remains resilient, supported by the broader market’s cautious outlook on the US economy. The USD's struggle is also evident across other major pairs, including EUR/USD, as investors remain wary of the potential fallout from tariff disputes. With the AUD/USD pair holding steady near 0.7100, traders will likely focus on further developments in the trade front and any potential shifts in global risk sentiment for the next directional move in the currency pair.

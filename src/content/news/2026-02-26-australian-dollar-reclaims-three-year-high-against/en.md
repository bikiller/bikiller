The Australian Dollar (AUD) surged to a three-year high against the US Dollar (USD) during the late Asian trading session on Thursday, touching the 0.7140 level. This upward momentum was fueled by rising expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will continue its hawkish stance on interest rates. The AUD has shown resilience across the board, trading solidly against its major peers.

The AUD/USD exchange rate reached its highest point since 2020, reflecting market confidence in the RBA's potential tightening policies. As traders factor in the central bank's aggressive stance, further gains in the Australian Dollar could be expected, with technical resistance now eyeing higher levels. The rally underscores growing optimism around Australia’s economic outlook amidst global market volatility.

Deutsche Bank's latest Macro Strategy report signals a positive outlook for the USD, bolstered by strong economic data. The ISM manufacturing index unexpectedly surged, sparking renewed optimism for the U.S. economy in 2026. This economic strength is likely to continue supporting the dollar, driving upward pressure on currency pairs like EUR/USD, which could see further downside as USD momentum persists.

As a result, traders are closely watching the USD for potential gains against major currencies. The upbeat data suggests that the USD may maintain its bullish trend, with the potential for a rise in the exchange rate against the EUR. The ongoing market movement reflects broader confidence in U.S. growth, positioning the dollar for sustained strength in the coming months, with technical levels favoring continued USD dominance.

EUR/USD bounced back on Wednesday as the US Dollar's recent upward momentum began to lose steam. After hitting a daily low of 1.1711, the Euro gained ground, pushing the exchange rate up to 1.1805 at the time of writing. The decline in USD strength allowed the EUR to recover from earlier intraday losses, offering a glimpse of support for the currency pair.

The fading bullish momentum in the Greenback has provided a window for the Euro to rebound. As EUR/USD trades around 1.1805, market participants are closely monitoring the pair for further signs of stability. The technical level of 1.1711 remains a key support, with traders watching for any shifts in USD sentiment to guide future price action.

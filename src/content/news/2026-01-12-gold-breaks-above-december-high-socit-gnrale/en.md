Gold has surged past its December high, climbing from an interim low near $4,270, indicative of renewed upside momentum. Société Générale's FX analysts highlight that this move signals a successful defense of the asset's multi-month rising trend line, emphasizing the strength in the market for the precious metal.

This upward trajectory in gold may have implications for major currency pairs, particularly as traders assess the impact on the USD and EUR exchange rates. As gold prices rise, investors may shift their focus, affecting trading strategies across the forex market and potentially increasing volatility in currency pair movements.

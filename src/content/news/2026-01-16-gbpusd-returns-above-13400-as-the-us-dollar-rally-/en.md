The GBP/USD currency pair has rebounded above the 1.3400 level as the recent rally of the US Dollar begins to lose momentum. Trading saw the pair recover from Thursday's lows of approximately 1.3360, indicating a modest recovery in the Pound. With the US session set to open, this movement suggests a stabilization in the exchange rate after a two-week decline of around 0.7%.

As the week draws to a close, GBP/USD is positioned to end nearly unchanged, reflecting the ongoing volatility in the forex market. Market participants are closely watching this currency pair, as fluctuations in the USD and economic data releases could further influence trading dynamics. The Pound's ability to maintain its position above 1.3400 will be crucial for traders looking for signs of future strength or weakness in the exchange rate.

The Pound Sterling (GBP) faced renewed selling pressure on Friday as the UK’s economic prospects dimmed following the release of disappointing Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures for October. The economy contracted by 0.1% for the second consecutive month, falling short of expectations for a slight 0.1% expansion. This unexpected downturn has prompted traders to reassess their positions on GBP.

In the forex market, the GBP/USD exchange rate reflected this bearish sentiment, slipping as investors reacted to the news. The currency pair was last seen trading below key technical levels, raising concerns about further declines. Against the euro, the GBP also weakened, with the EUR/GBP pair gaining traction as the euro strengthened on the back of a more robust economic outlook. This development may have lasting implications for the Bank of England's monetary policy, increasing speculation about potential interest rate adjustments in the near future.

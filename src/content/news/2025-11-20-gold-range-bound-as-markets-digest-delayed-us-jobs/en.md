Gold (XAU/USD) remains range-bound as traders analyze the mixed September US jobs data, which was released later than expected. Currently, the XAU/USD currency pair is trading around $4,080, having eased slightly after surpassing the crucial $4,100 psychological barrier earlier in the day. This indecisive movement reflects market caution amid fluctuating economic indicators.

As the trading day progresses, the implications of the delayed jobs report are being considered by investors in the forex market. The exchange rate dynamics between gold and the USD are pivotal, with fluctuations in the labor market data impacting overall market sentiment. Consequently, traders are watching for further signals that could influence gold prices and subsequent trading strategies.

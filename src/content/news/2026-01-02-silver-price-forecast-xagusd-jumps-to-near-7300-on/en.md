Silver prices (XAG/USD) experienced a significant surge, climbing to approximately $72.90 during Asian trading on Friday, driven by heightened safe-haven demand and speculation surrounding potential US interest rate cuts. The precious metal has witnessed an extraordinary increase of over 140% in 2025, marking its most substantial rise since 1979, amid shifting market dynamics.

The ongoing optimism around potential monetary easing by the Federal Reserve has fueled interest in silver, as investors seek refuge from economic uncertainties. As the currency pair approaches the $73.00 threshold, traders are closely monitoring movements in the USD, as any shifts in interest rate expectations could further influence silver’s exchange rate and trading patterns in the coming sessions.

Silver (XAG/USD) is showing some signs of recovery after hitting a seven-month low near $64.00 earlier today. Trading just above the $74.00 mark during the early European session, the precious metal remains under pressure. Despite efforts to bounce back, silver has struggled to reclaim the critical $75.00 level, which previously served as a support zone.

The persistent weakness in silver's price can be attributed to broader market conditions, with the USD maintaining strength across the board. The lack of momentum above $75.00 raises concerns that silver may remain capped in the short term, with traders eyeing potential further downside if the pair fails to stabilize. The technical outlook for XAG/USD suggests that any recovery will face stiff resistance around the $75.00 area.

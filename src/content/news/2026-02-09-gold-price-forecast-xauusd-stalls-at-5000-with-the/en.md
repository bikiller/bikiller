Gold (XAU/USD) continues its upward trajectory, gaining for the second straight month on the back of moderate US Dollar (USD) weakness. The yellow metal's exchange rate remains buoyant as the bullish trend holds, but it faces resistance around the psychological $5,000 mark. Despite the ongoing momentum, gold struggles to establish solid footing above this level, leaving the market cautious.

The trading environment remains volatile, with USD softness supporting gold's rise. However, the inability to sustain levels above $5,000 suggests a lack of strong conviction among buyers. As XAU/USD presses against this key resistance, the market will likely look to USD fluctuations and broader global economic factors for further direction, keeping the focus on any potential shifts in investor sentiment.

The GBP/JPY currency pair experienced a pullback on Tuesday, retreating from session highs near the 213.50 level following the release of mixed UK employment data. This uncertainty has left the exchange rate hovering around 213.00, as traders grapple with the implications of the economic figures on future trading strategies.

Despite the recent decline, support remains intact above the 212.30 mark, indicating that downside risks are somewhat limited for the Pound against the Yen. As the market navigates through these developments, the lack of decisive direction suggests a cautious approach from traders, with attention now focused on potential triggers that could influence the pair's next move.

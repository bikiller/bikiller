Middle East trade is set for robust growth, with projections showing a 15% increase between 2021 and 2024, outpacing the global growth rate of 9%. The expansion is largely driven by the region's strong ties with Asia, which will dominate the trade corridor. Asia's trade with the Middle East is expected to grow from USD 0.9 trillion in 2024 to USD 1.5 trillion by 2030, reflecting increased demand for goods and services.

This surge in trade activity is likely to influence currency pairs like USD/EUR and USD/JPY, with fluctuations in exchange rates anticipated as traders respond to the shifting dynamics. As the USD remains the primary currency in global trade, its role in Middle Eastern transactions will become even more crucial. Traders should monitor the movement in these pairs closely as the region’s economic influence grows, affecting broader forex market trends.

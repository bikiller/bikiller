Gold (XAU/USD) is recovering from earlier losses, currently trading around $4,880 after bouncing from a session low of $4,655 in Asian trading. The precious metal is benefitting from a risk-off sentiment in the markets, as investors seek safe-haven assets amid rising global uncertainties. The US dollar remains under pressure, contributing to gold’s upward momentum.

The rebound in XAU/USD comes as risk aversion drives demand for safe-haven assets. With global market volatility increasing, the gold price is approaching key technical resistance levels, with $4,900 now within reach. Traders are closely watching the potential for further movement, as any signs of dollar weakness could push the currency pair higher in the near term, while a stronger USD could limit gains.

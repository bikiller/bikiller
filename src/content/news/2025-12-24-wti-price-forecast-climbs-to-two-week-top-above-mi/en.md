West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices have surged to a nearly two-week high, reaching approximately $58.55 on Wednesday. This increase comes as traders respond to ongoing geopolitical risks that are impacting supply dynamics in the energy market. The recent recovery marks a significant rebound from the lows seen last week, when WTI prices hit their lowest levels since May.

As WTI continues to climb, the market is closely monitoring the implications for the USD, given that oil is priced in dollars. A stronger oil market could influence exchange rates, particularly against the EUR, as traders reassess their positions in light of fluctuating commodity prices. The recent price action underscores the sensitivity of crude oil to geopolitical developments, with traders keenly observing any new factors that could sway market sentiment.

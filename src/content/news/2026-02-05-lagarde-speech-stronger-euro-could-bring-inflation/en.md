European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde said a stronger euro could dampen inflation more than expected as the ECB held key rates steady at its February meeting. Speaking after the decision, she highlighted exchange rate dynamics as an important transmission channel, noting that euro appreciation reduces import costs. The comments supported the EUR in trading, with the EUR/USD currency pair holding firm as policy settings stayed unchanged.

Markets read the remarks as mildly dovish, suggesting currency strength could substitute for tighter monetary policy by easing price pressures. In forex trading, attention turned to how the USD interacts with euro moves, particularly if disinflation gains traction. For the EUR/USD exchange rate, traders assessed whether sustained EUR strength could influence the timing of future rate cuts.

Lagarde emphasized that the ECB remains data dependent, with decisions driven by inflation and growth rather than short-term market moves. For currency markets, this points to a potentially narrower rate differential path, shaping trading strategies across EUR pairs versus the USD. A resilient euro could help cap imported inflation and steer broader FX sentiment.

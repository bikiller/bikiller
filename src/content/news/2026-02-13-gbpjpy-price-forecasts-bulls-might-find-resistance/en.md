The GBP/JPY currency pair is recovering on Friday after hitting a near two-week low of 207.60, with the exchange rate now trading above the 209.00 mark. The Pound has been under pressure recently, but a bounce back from this key support level is providing some relief to traders.

Looking ahead, bulls may encounter resistance around the 209.65 area, which could cap further upside potential. A break above this level could open the door to higher gains, but the current price action suggests a cautious approach in the near term as the pair remains vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment and broader trading dynamics.

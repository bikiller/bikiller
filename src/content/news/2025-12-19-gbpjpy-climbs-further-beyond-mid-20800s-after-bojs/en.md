The GBP/JPY currency pair continues its upward momentum, climbing further beyond the mid-208.00s following the Bank of Japan's widely anticipated 25 basis points rate hike. This move has attracted dip-buyers during the Asian session on Friday, helping to stabilize the exchange rate after a pullback from levels just above the 209.00 mark, which represents a fresh high not seen since August 2008.

Market participants are responding positively to the Bank of Japan's decision, suggesting a growing confidence in the Japanese economy. The rate hike adds to the ongoing volatility in the forex market, as traders assess the implications for other major currencies like the USD and EUR. As GBP/JPY continues to trade at elevated levels, analysts will be closely watching for any shifts in sentiment that could influence future price movements.

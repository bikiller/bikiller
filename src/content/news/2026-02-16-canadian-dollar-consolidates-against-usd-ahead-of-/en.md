The USD/CAD currency pair remained in a consolidation phase on Monday, continuing its sideways movement for the second consecutive day. During the Asian session, the pair traded above the 1.3600 level, with market participants awaiting key economic releases later in the week. This price action reflects a cautious stance as traders brace for Canada's upcoming Consumer Price Index (CPI) data and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) minutes.

The current trading range has seen the Canadian Dollar stabilize against the USD, with the exchange rate maintaining a steady course despite global economic uncertainties. With the CPI data and FOMC minutes on the horizon, market participants are keenly focused on any developments that could influence the Bank of Canada's monetary policy or offer further insight into the Federal Reserve's future actions. As a result, the pair is expected to remain within its current range until more definitive market catalysts emerge.

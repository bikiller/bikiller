Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a significant correction on Monday, plunging 4.50% to trade around $4,330 after reaching a record high at the end of last week. This sharp decline reflects a combination of profit-taking by investors and a rebound in the U.S. dollar, which has regained some strength against major currencies.

The recent surge in gold prices had been driven by heightened market demand, but the latest movements indicate a shift in sentiment. As traders adjust their positions, the fluctuating exchange rates are likely to impact further trading dynamics, particularly for currencies such as EUR and JPY, as investors closely monitor the ongoing developments in the forex market.

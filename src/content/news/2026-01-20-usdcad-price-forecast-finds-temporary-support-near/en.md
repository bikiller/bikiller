The USD/CAD currency pair is trading 0.13% lower, hovering around the exchange rate of 1.3850 during the early European session on Tuesday. The Canadian Dollar, or Loonie, is facing downward pressure as the US Dollar exhibits weakness, driven by ongoing tensions between the United States and the European Union regarding the future of Greenland.

This market movement highlights the sensitivity of the USD to geopolitical developments. The temporary support found near the 20-day exponential moving average suggests a crucial technical level for traders, who will be closely monitoring further developments in this dispute and their potential impact on the currency exchange dynamics between the USD and CAD.

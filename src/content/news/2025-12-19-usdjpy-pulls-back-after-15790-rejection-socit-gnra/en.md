The USD/JPY currency pair has pulled back after encountering significant resistance at 157.90. Despite this setback, the exchange rate remains above the crucial 50-day moving average, indicating a degree of support. Analysts at Société Générale suggest that the recent price action may remain rangebound unless a decisive breakout above 156.95 occurs, potentially igniting renewed bullish momentum.

Market participants are closely watching these technical levels for further clues on the USD/JPY's trajectory. A breach of 156.95 could signal a shift in sentiment, allowing traders to target higher levels. Conversely, failure to maintain support could lead to increased volatility and downward pressure on the exchange rate, highlighting the importance of these price points in upcoming trading sessions.

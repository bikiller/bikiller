The Australian Dollar (AUD) is expected to trade within a higher range of 0.6685 to 0.6730 against the US Dollar (USD), according to UOB Group's analysis. This shift indicates a growing upward momentum, suggesting that traders may see a more stable range for the AUD rather than a significant long-term advance beyond these levels.

Factors contributing to this movement include improving market sentiment and potential shifts in the USD's strength. As the AUD/USD currency pair stabilizes within this range, traders will closely monitor economic indicators that could influence further fluctuations in the exchange rate, particularly any developments in the broader financial markets or geopolitical landscape that may affect both currencies.

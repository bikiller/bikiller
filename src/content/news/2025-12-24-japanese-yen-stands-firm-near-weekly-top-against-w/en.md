The Japanese Yen (JPY) continues its upward movement against the US Dollar (USD), maintaining its position near the weekly peak as trading progresses into the early European session on Wednesday. The JPY has gained ground for the third consecutive day, reflecting a broader weakness in the USD that has been evident in the currency markets. 

As the exchange rate for the USD/JPY remains under pressure, investors are closely monitoring the Yen's momentum, which appears poised for further advances. This trend signals potential shifts in market sentiment and could have implications for trading strategies focused on currency pairs involving the JPY and USD.

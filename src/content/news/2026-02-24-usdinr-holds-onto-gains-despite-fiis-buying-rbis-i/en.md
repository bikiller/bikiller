The Indian Rupee (INR) remains under pressure against the US Dollar (USD) on Tuesday, with the USD/INR pair holding onto Monday’s gains around the 91.10 level. Despite a strong inflow of foreign institutional investment (FII) into Indian equities, the INR has struggled to gain ground, reflecting broader market sentiment. The currency pair's resistance remains firmly at 91.20, with traders closely watching for any signs of further support from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

The RBI's intervention continues to play a crucial role in managing the INR's volatility, but the impact has been limited as the USD maintains its strength. The ongoing FII inflows, which typically boost the INR, have not been enough to reverse the current downtrend. As the pair hovers near 91.10, market participants remain cautious, waiting for clearer signals from both global and domestic factors that could shift the exchange rate dynamics.

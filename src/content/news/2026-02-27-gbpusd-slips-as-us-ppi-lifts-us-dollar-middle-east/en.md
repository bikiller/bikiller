GBP/USD edged lower on Friday, slipping by 0.10% as the US Dollar gained momentum following a stronger-than-expected US Producer Price Index (PPI) report. The data raised concerns over persistent inflation, leading traders to recalibrate their expectations for the Federal Reserve’s future monetary policy. The exchange rate for GBP/USD fell to 1.2070, with the USD benefitting from the shift toward a less dovish outlook.

The rise in US inflation data put pressure on the British Pound as the market adjusted to potential Fed tightening. As the Dollar strengthened, concerns over growing Middle East tensions added to the uncertainty. With GBP/USD trading near its lowest levels in months, traders are watching for further signals on US inflation and Fed policy. If the trend continues, the exchange rate could face more downside, with support seen around the 1.2000 mark.

Gold prices (XAU/USD) have declined by 0.6%, trading just below $4,270 during the European session on Tuesday. This drop comes amid heightened selling pressure as traders engage in profit-taking following the recent surge that saw the yellow metal peak above the significant resistance level of $4,350. The market's reaction indicates a critical adjustment as investors reassess their positions.

The focus now shifts to the upcoming US Non-Farm Payroll (NFP) report, which is expected to impact the USD exchange rate significantly. A strong NFP reading could bolster the US dollar further, potentially leading to additional downward pressure on gold prices. As the market anticipates these economic indicators, trading dynamics for XAU/USD may remain volatile in the short term.

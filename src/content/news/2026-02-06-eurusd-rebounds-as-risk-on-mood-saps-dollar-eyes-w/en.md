The EUR/USD currency pair saw a rebound on Friday, as risk-on sentiment weighed on the US Dollar. After a brief two-day rally, the Greenback reversed its Thursday gains, with the US Dollar Index (DXY) retreating. The Euro strengthened amid broad-based market optimism, pushing the exchange rate higher despite the USD’s recent push. 

The EUR/USD exchange rate briefly tested the 1.0900 level before consolidating near 1.0850 by the close of trading. This price action suggests a potential consolidation phase for the pair, as the risk-on mood takes hold, softening demand for the Dollar. Traders will likely watch for further signs of market sentiment and any shifts in US economic data for direction in the coming sessions.

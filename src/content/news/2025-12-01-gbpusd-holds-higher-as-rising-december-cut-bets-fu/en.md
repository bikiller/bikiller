The GBP/USD currency pair gained modestly on Monday, rising over 0.20% as market sentiment shifted towards a potential rate cut by the Federal Reserve in the upcoming meeting. This speculation has bolstered demand for the British Pound, reflecting growing investor confidence in a more dovish monetary policy outlook from the U.S. central bank.

Traders are also factoring in the possibility of Kevin Hassett, the White House Economic Adviser, being nominated to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed Chair. This potential leadership change could further influence the Fed's approach to interest rates. As a result, the exchange rate of GBP/USD is being shaped by these developments, highlighting the interplay between U.S. monetary policy and the Sterling's performance in the forex market.

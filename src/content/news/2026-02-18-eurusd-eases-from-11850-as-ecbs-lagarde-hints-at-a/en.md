EUR/USD has pulled back from the 1.1850 mark as the Euro weakens against the US Dollar. The European Central Bank’s (ECB) President Christine Lagarde raised concerns about an earlier-than-expected policy shift, dampening investor sentiment. The exchange rate, which briefly tested the 1.1850 resistance level, is now facing pressure as traders react to the possibility of a change in ECB stance.

The EUR/USD currency pair continues to trade lower, reflecting the market's caution ahead of potential ECB actions. At the time of writing, the Euro is trading firmly below 1.1850, indicating a shift in sentiment after Lagarde's comments. The ongoing uncertainty in the eurozone and the relative strength of the USD, supported by rising U.S. yields, is adding to downward pressure on the pair.

GBP/USD has shown signs of recovery, trading around 1.3830 during the Asian session on Thursday after recently losing ground. This movement comes as the currency pair approaches key resistance levels near 1.3850, which represents four-year highs. The shift in the exchange rate highlights the ongoing volatility in the forex market, driven by fluctuating buyer sentiment.

However, a technical analysis of the daily chart suggests a potential bearish reversal, as the narrowing range indicates decreasing momentum among buyers. The formation of a rising wedge pattern raises concerns about the sustainability of this upward movement. Traders will be closely monitoring these developments to gauge whether the GBP can maintain its strength against the USD or if a correction is imminent.

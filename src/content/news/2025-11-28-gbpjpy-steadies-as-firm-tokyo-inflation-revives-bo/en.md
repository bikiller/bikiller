The GBP/JPY currency pair remained stable on Friday as traders digested the latest Tokyo inflation figures, which indicate a potential shift in the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) monetary policy. The exchange rate hovered around 170.00, reflecting cautious sentiment in the market. The data has rekindled speculation regarding a possible interest rate hike by the BoJ, prompting investors to reassess their positions.

As inflation in Tokyo shows signs of firming, market observers are closely monitoring the implications for the yen's strength against other major currencies. A tightening stance from the BoJ could influence cross-currency dynamics, particularly against the USD and EUR, as traders weigh the potential for higher interest rates in Japan. With the current trading environment, the GBP/JPY exchange rate is poised for further volatility as developments unfold.

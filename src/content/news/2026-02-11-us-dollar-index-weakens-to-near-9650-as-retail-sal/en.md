The US Dollar Index (DXY) saw a decline during Asian trading hours on Wednesday, slipping to around 96.65 as US retail sales data showed signs of stagnation. This weakening of the USD came amidst concerns over economic growth, impacting the greenback's appeal against major currencies. The EUR/USD exchange rate saw some uptick as a result, though the move remained cautious in the face of upcoming data.

Market attention now turns to the delayed US non-farm payrolls (NFP) report for January, expected to influence the broader forex market. Traders are eager for insights on employment trends to gauge the Federal Reserve's stance on future interest rate hikes. With the USD on a weaker footing, the report could play a crucial role in determining the next market direction, with the 96.50 level on the DXY in focus.

The forex market saw subdued movement on Monday, February 16, as traders prepared for the upcoming week’s key events. The EUR/USD remained range-bound, hovering around 1.0700, with little direction in the absence of major economic data. The USD index (DXY) held steady at 102.50, showing only slight fluctuations. 

The British pound faced some pressure, with GBP/USD dipping to 1.2040, as market participants awaited the UK’s inflation data due later this week. Meanwhile, the USD/JPY was also trading flat, consolidating near 131.50. As markets anticipate the Federal Reserve’s next moves, attention will turn to upcoming data releases for signs of continued inflationary pressures or any shift in monetary policy.

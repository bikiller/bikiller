Gold (XAU/USD) experienced a rebound on Thursday, recovering from earlier losses as US inflation data fell short of expectations. Currently trading at approximately $4,337, the currency pair is testing the upper boundary of the range that has characterized its price action this week. The unexpected dip in inflation has fueled investor interest in gold, typically seen as a safe haven during economic uncertainty.

The weaker-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) has implications for the USD, potentially influencing future monetary policy decisions by the Federal Reserve. As traders adjust their positions, the exchange rate of XAU/USD reflects a shift in market sentiment, emphasizing the interplay between inflation data and gold trading dynamics. Continued fluctuations in inflation rates will likely keep the gold market active as participants navigate the evolving economic landscape.

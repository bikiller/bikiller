The Canadian Dollar (CAD) has strengthened against the US Dollar (USD) on Monday, driven by a weaker Greenback and stable Oil prices. At the time of writing, the USD/CAD currency pair is trading around 1.3568, marking its lowest point since January 31. This represents a drop of more than 0.50% on the day, reflecting the Loonie's resilience in the market.

Oil prices, which have remained steady, continue to support the Canadian Dollar, given the country's reliance on energy exports. Meanwhile, the USD's softer performance across global markets has allowed the CAD to extend its gains. The current technical level of 1.3600 is proving significant as USD/CAD slips further below it, signaling a potential continuation of the Loonie's strength in the near term.

The USD/CAD currency pair is holding steady near the 1.4050 mark, recovering from modest losses seen in the previous trading session. During the Asian hours on Monday, the exchange rate hovered around 1.4030 as the U.S. dollar strengthened. This movement reflects the ongoing challenges faced by the Canadian dollar, which is closely linked to commodity prices.

The decline in crude oil prices is a significant factor contributing to the CAD's struggles. As oil prices fall, the Canadian dollar typically weakens, leading to increased demand for the U.S. dollar. Traders are closely monitoring these dynamics, as shifts in the oil market can heavily influence the USD/CAD exchange rate in the coming sessions.

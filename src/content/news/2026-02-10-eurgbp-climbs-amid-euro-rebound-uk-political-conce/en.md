EUR/GBP is trading at 0.8715 on Tuesday, marking a 0.15% increase on the day. The rise in the currency pair reflects a modest rebound in the Euro (EUR), which has gained some traction despite limited momentum. The recent actions and signals from the European Central Bank (ECB) have kept the Euro’s rally contained, preventing a more pronounced upward move.

The UK’s political uncertainty is adding pressure on the British Pound (GBP), supporting the EUR/GBP cross. Traders are closely monitoring the ongoing political developments in the UK, which continue to fuel market concerns. As these factors influence the broader sentiment, EUR/GBP remains in a cautious upward trajectory, though broader trends in the forex market, including movements in the USD, could impact future price action.

The Japanese Yen (JPY) continued its strong performance during Monday's Asian session, pushing the USD/JPY currency pair down to the key psychological level of 155.00. The Yen's steady ascent has been fueled by expectations of a hawkish stance from the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which has heightened market sentiment around JPY strength.

As traders react to these developments, the exchange rate reflects a growing belief in the potential for tighter monetary policy from the BoJ. This movement could have significant implications for trading dynamics in the forex market, particularly affecting how USD and JPY interact in the near term. The pressure on USD/JPY may prompt further adjustments as traders reassess their positions in light of evolving economic indicators.

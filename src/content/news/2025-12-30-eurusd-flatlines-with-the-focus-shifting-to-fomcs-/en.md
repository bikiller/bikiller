EUR/USD is holding steady on Tuesday, trading around 1.1770 as market activity quiets ahead of the New Year holiday. With little movement observed in the currency pair, traders are closely monitoring developments as they await the release of the FOMC's meeting minutes, which could provide insights into the Federal Reserve's monetary policy outlook.

As market participants position themselves for potential volatility following the release of the minutes, any significant shifts in sentiment could influence trading strategies and impact the EUR/USD dynamics in the coming days.

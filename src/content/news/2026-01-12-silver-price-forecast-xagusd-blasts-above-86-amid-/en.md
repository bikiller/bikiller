Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a significant surge on Monday, climbing to a record high of $86.23 per troy ounce. This rally marks a nearly 7.50% increase as buyers capitalized on emerging market sentiment following the indictment of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell by the US Department of Justice. The indictment has sparked concerns regarding monetary policy, prompting traders to seek refuge in silver.

The climb in silver prices reflects a broader shift in investor sentiment within the forex market, where the exchange rate dynamics between the USD and other currencies are increasingly influenced by political developments. As traders adjust their positions, the implications for both the silver market and the broader currency landscape may lead to heightened volatility in the coming days, especially for those engaged in trading XAG/USD and other precious metals.

WTI crude oil prices experienced significant volatility this week, driven by uncertainty surrounding the second round of US-Iran nuclear talks in Geneva. As negotiations progressed, traders reacted to the potential impact on global supply, especially with the looming threat of a possible closure of the Strait of Hormuz. Crude surged to $92.15 per barrel, up 3.5% from the previous week, while the USD/EUR exchange rate saw fluctuations as oil’s price movements influenced broader market sentiment.

The market's attention was firmly on the geopolitical risks tied to the nuclear talks, with the potential for heightened tensions affecting oil production and transportation in the region. The USD strengthened slightly against major currencies, with the EUR/USD trading near 1.0680, while crude's gains impacted oil-linked assets. Analysts suggest that any disruption in the Strait of Hormuz could send oil prices even higher, further complicating global trade and affecting trading strategies for both the USD and oil-related pairs.

Gold (XAU/USD) remains resilient above the crucial $4,600 level on Thursday, despite some initial selling pressure as traders take profits after Wednesday’s rally to a new record high of approximately $4,643. The precious metal continues to attract interest amid ongoing uncertainty surrounding Federal Reserve policies and geopolitical tensions.

The stability of gold prices reflects the market's cautious sentiment, with traders eyeing potential shifts in the Federal Reserve's monetary stance that could influence the USD exchange rate. As geopolitical factors persist, gold's status as a safe-haven asset remains a key driver for investors, keeping demand robust and positioning it as a focal point in the current trading environment.

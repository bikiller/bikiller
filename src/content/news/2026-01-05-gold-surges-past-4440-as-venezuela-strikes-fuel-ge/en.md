The currency pair saw a rebound from daily lows of $4,345, trading at $4,442 at the time of writing. This sharp increase reflects heightened investor concern regarding the potential ramifications of these military actions on the global economy.

The surge in gold prices indicates a flight to safety among traders seeking to hedge against geopolitical risks. As the XAU/USD exchange rate continues to climb, market participants are closely monitoring developments in Venezuela and their impact on broader currency movements, including the USD and EUR.

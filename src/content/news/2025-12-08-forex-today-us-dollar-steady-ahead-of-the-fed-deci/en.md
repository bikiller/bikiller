The US Dollar Index (DXY) remained steady on Monday, trading above the critical 99.00 level as traders positioned themselves ahead of the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision. Market sentiment is closely tied to expectations surrounding the Fed’s monetary policy stance and the anticipated Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which could significantly influence the USD's trajectory against major currencies.

As investors wait for the release of key US employment data, the stability of the DXY suggests cautious optimism in the market. Currency pairs like EUR/USD and USD/JPY may experience heightened volatility in response to the Fed’s announcements, potentially altering exchange rates and trading strategies as participants seek to capitalize on any shifts in economic outlook and interest rates.

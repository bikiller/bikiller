The USD/INR currency pair saw a decline on Tuesday, reversing two days of gains as the Indian Rupee (INR) strengthened. The rupee benefited from positive foreign inflows, buoyed by a trade deal between India and the United States. Market sentiment turned favorable for the INR as the exchange rate fell to ₹83.20 against the USD, showing a marked shift in momentum.

Despite the gains for the INR, the US Dollar remained resilient, supported by routine hedging activity and local inflows, which provided some resistance against further INR appreciation. Traders noted that the USD/INR exchange rate continued to fluctuate within familiar ranges, though the Indian currency showed signs of stability following recent foreign investments and favorable trade negotiations.

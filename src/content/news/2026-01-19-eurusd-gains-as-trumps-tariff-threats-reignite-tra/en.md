The Euro (EUR) is experiencing a rebound against the US Dollar (USD) as it trades at approximately 1.1648, marking an increase of nearly 0.40% on the day. This rise comes after US President Donald Trump reignited fears of a trade war with his latest tariff threats, putting downward pressure on the Greenback. The movement ends a four-day streak of losses for the EUR/USD currency pair.

Traders are reacting to the renewed uncertainty in US trade policy, which has prompted a shift in market sentiment. The implications of a potential trade conflict could further influence the exchange rate dynamics between the EUR and USD, as investors reassess their positions amid changing economic forecasts. As the situation unfolds, market participants will be keenly watching for further developments that could impact the forex landscape.

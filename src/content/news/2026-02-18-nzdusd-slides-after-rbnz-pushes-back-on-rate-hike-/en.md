The NZD/USD exchange rate fell sharply on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) kept its Official Cash Rate (OCR) unchanged, as anticipated by the market. However, it was the dovish tone of the central bank's statement that caught traders' attention, pushing the Kiwi lower. The currency pair slid to a low of 0.6215, reflecting a notable decline from previous levels.

The RBNZ's caution regarding rate hikes has dampened expectations of aggressive tightening, which had supported the New Zealand dollar in recent months. The shift in sentiment has led to increased pressure on the NZD/USD, with traders adjusting positions in response. As a result, the pair is now testing support levels near 0.6200, while market participants await further signals on future monetary policy from both the RBNZ and the Federal Reserve.

Silver (XAG/USD) experienced a significant pullback after reaching an all-time high of 121.67 in late January. The precious metal lost over 40% of its value, dropping sharply as traders adjusted positions. This correction saw silver find crucial support around the 64.00 level in early February, sparking renewed interest and prompting potential for a bullish reversal in the short term.

As silver price action stabilizes, market participants are closely watching the 64.00 zone for confirmation of a recovery. The recent price dynamics suggest that demand could pick up again, particularly if risk sentiment in global markets improves. This sets up the XAG/USD pair for potential gains as it tests higher levels, with traders eyeing possible resistance near the 80.00 mark in the coming weeks.

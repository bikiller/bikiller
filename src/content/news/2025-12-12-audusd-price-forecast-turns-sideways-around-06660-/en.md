The AUD/USD currency pair has entered a period of consolidation around the 0.6660 level, following a robust three-week rally that saw it reach a fresh three-month high of 0.6686 on Wednesday. As trading resumed in early European hours on Friday, the exchange rate exhibited a calm demeanor, suggesting a momentary pause in momentum.

This sideways movement may reflect market participants reassessing their positions after the recent gains. The Australian dollar's performance has been influenced by broader economic trends and trader sentiment towards the USD. Investors now watch closely for any catalysts that could reignite volatility and drive the currency pair back towards its recent high or initiate a new trend.

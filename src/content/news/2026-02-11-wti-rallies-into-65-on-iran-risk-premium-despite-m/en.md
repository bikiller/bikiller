West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices surged above $65.00 per barrel on Wednesday, marking a more than 1% gain. The rally was largely driven by mounting geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran, which have injected a notable risk premium into global energy markets. This price movement signals heightened volatility in commodity trading, with oil traders factoring in potential disruptions to supply.

Despite a significant increase in U.S. crude oil inventories, as reported by the EIA, the risk sentiment surrounding the ongoing US-Iran conflict overshadowed bearish inventory data. As traders react to the shifting geopolitical landscape, WTI's climb has prompted a stronger USD, with the dollar gaining ground against several major currency pairs. The market remains watchful, as further developments in US-Iran relations could have lasting implications on energy and forex markets alike.

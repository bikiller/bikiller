EUR/JPY fell to around 185.55 during the early European session on Monday, losing momentum after a strong rally. The Japanese Yen gained strength against the Euro following the landslide victory of Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the country's lower house election on Sunday. This political shift boosted market confidence in Japan’s economic stability, leading to the yen's appreciation.

The EUR/JPY currency pair had been under pressure, dipping below the key 185.50 level as the yen rose against the euro. With the LDP's victory, expectations of continued policy stability and favorable economic reforms in Japan have enhanced investor sentiment towards the JPY. As the market digests the election outcome, traders will likely continue to watch the EUR/JPY exchange rate for further movements, especially as political developments influence the global trading landscape.

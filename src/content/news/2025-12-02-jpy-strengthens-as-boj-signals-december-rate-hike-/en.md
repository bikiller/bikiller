The Japanese Yen (JPY) has gained momentum in overnight trading, bolstered by comments from Bank of Japan (BoJ) Governor Kazuo Ueda signalling a potential rate hike in December. Following this announcement, the USD/JPY exchange rate saw a noticeable decline, reflecting a stronger Yen as traders adjusted their positions in anticipation of the BoJ's monetary policy shift.

As the market digests this development, the JPY is trading at levels not seen in recent weeks. This shift has implications for other currency pairs, particularly against the Euro (EUR) and the US Dollar (USD). Analysts predict that if the BoJ follows through with the rate hikes, it could further enhance the Yen's appeal, impacting global market dynamics and investor sentiment in the forex arena.

Gold (XAU/USD) extended its rally to new record highs on Thursday, adding to Wednesday’s impressive 3.87% gain. The surge comes amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty, which continues to spur demand for safe-haven assets. Increased volatility across global markets has driven investors toward gold, reflecting growing risk aversion as concerns over the broader economic outlook persist.

As gold prices rise, the strong bullish momentum is evident, with the precious metal benefitting from ongoing inflows. The XAU/USD pair has seen substantial gains, supported by a shift in investor sentiment as geopolitical tensions persist. Traders are closely watching the continued fluctuations, which could push gold even higher, challenging previously untested levels. This rally underscores the enduring appeal of gold in uncertain times, overshadowing weakness in the USD and other currencies.

The USD/JPY currency pair has rebounded roughly 50% from last week’s decline, currently hovering just below the 155.00 mark. This recovery comes amid cautious market sentiment surrounding the Bank of Japan's (BoJ) policy stance. While expectations for a rate hike persist, the BoJ remains conservative, signaling that the next move could come at the April 28 meeting.

Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH) analysts noted that the BoJ's recent policy meeting further emphasizes its careful approach to tightening. The market has largely priced in a potential rate hike in April, though any drastic moves from the BoJ are still unlikely. This dovish stance keeps pressure on the yen, with the USD/JPY exchange rate remaining well-supported above the key 155.00 level.

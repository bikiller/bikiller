The EUR/USD currency pair is showing signs of a slight increase in downward momentum, with analysts from UOB Group indicating that any decline may be capped around the 1.1570 mark. This suggests traders should be prepared for a potential test of this level in the near term. 

Looking further ahead, the exchange rate is expected to trade within a broader range of 1.1540 to 1.1640. This outlook reflects a cautious sentiment in the market as investors weigh the implications of economic data and monetary policy decisions affecting the Euro and the USD.

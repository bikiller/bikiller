      "content": "当前Solana/美元（SOL/USD）价格呈现震荡整理态势，最新价格为78.45美元。市场整体波动较小，24小时内变化为0.62%。该币种未显著突破当前区间（77.96-78.78），显示出短期内多空力量的博弈。需要注意，RSI和MACD数据尚未完全反映市场情绪，说明短期趋势不明确。\n\n从技术面来看，SOL/USD当前在SMA(20)的下方运行（79.49），表明短期内价格受到一定的卖压。MACD线为负值（-0.80588499），显示出市场可能处于空头压力中，但缺乏信号线交叉的明确提示，仍需关注短期的市场波动。\n\n支撑位方面，77.96美元附近存在较强的买盘支撑，而阻力位则位于78.78美元附近。若价格突破该阻力位，可能引发上涨行情。反之，若价格跌破支撑位，可能出现进一步回调。\n\n基于当前的市场形势，建议投资者保持观望，耐心等待价格突破关键支撑或阻力位后再做决策。若突破78.78美元，可考虑逐步做多；若跌破77.96美元，则可考虑适度做空。"

The latest data signals pressure near the short‑term 20‑period simple moving average at *79.49*, which has been acting as dynamic resistance and keeping the price subdued. Breaking and holding above this average would be necessary before any meaningful trend shift higher can be confirmed. Meanwhile, the overall trend has been lacking bullish conviction as sellers remain active at lower highs, suggesting a continued choppy descent rather than a clear uptrend. \n\nIndicator interpretation underscores mixed momentum. Although the exact RSI(14) isn’t provided in your data, external observations around similar price zones show **oversold conditions** on momentum oscillators in broader contexts, hinting that downside exhaustion could occur soon if selling pressure abates. Your MACD reading of **‑0.8059**tion underscores mixed momentum. Although the exact RSI(14) isn’t provided in your data, external observations around similar price zones show **oversold conditions** on momentum oscillators in broader contexts, hinting that downside exhaustion could occur soon if selling pressure abates. Your MACD reading of **‑0.8059** suggests continued bearish momentum, even if the signal line isn’t available for a full crossover interpretation. The combination of MACD remaining negative and price below key simple moving averages is typically a caution flag, suggesting that **momentum remains tilted toward sellers** until a clean reversal signal emerges. \n\nOn support and resistance levels, psychological and technical zones are clear: immediate support sits near *75–76*, just below the current market price and acting as a short‑term floor fore-1579199?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *FXEmpire* · 2026/2/12\n> Solana network fees failed to rally alongside SOL’s price during the latest bullish cycle. Fees have been rising since the year started, and could help the token recover to a range between $120 and $140.\n\n\nOn support and resistance levels, psychological and technical zones are clear: immediate support sits near *75–76*, just below the current market price and acting as a short‑term floor for reactive buyers. A decisive breakdown below this area could open up deeper levels near *70–66*, where prior technical support or Fibonacci extensions appear aligned. Overhead resistance starts near the recent EMA cluster at roughly *80–82*, followed by more meaningful caps near *89–95*, where sellers previously stepped in. Reclaiming *90+* would improve the structure of this market. \n\nFor trading suggestions, cautious participants might watch for a **rejection or bounce at major support**: a solid bounce off *75* with volume could offer short‑term longs with tight risk management. If selling accelerates through that floor, avoiding new long positions until price stabilizes above *75* again is prudent. On the upside, a close above *80* bolstered by momentum could be a first sign of relief, but sustainable upside likely requires a break and hold above *89–rates through that floor, avoiding new long positions until price stabilizes above *75* again is prudent. On the upside, a close above *80* bolstered by momentum could be a first sign of relief, but sustainable upside likely requires a break and hold above *89–90* to shift sentiment toward a more sustained recovery. Risk management is critical, especially given the current bearish leaning of key indicators and moving averages. \n> **[Solana Long Term Holder Capitulation Reaches 3-Year High As Price Nears Losing $80](https://beincrypto.com/solana-price-nears-losing-support/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *BeInCrypto* · 2026/2/12\n> Solana price trades near $80 as profitable supply falls to 15%, increasing breakdown risk toward $70 if $79 fails."

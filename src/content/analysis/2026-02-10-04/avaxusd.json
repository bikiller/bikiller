Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche is currently trading in a **short-term consolidation phase** around $8.95 after recent sideways action. The fact that price is hugging the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA(20) at **8.982**) suggests hesitation between bulls and bears. The minor uptick in the past 24 hours shows slight bullish interest, but without a decisive break above the recent high, the market lacks directional conviction. Overall, the immediate trend is neutral with a slight bearish bias until key levels are resolved.\n\nOn indicators, the available MACD reading at **‑0.0153** indicates bearish momentum pressure, although the absence of a signal line comparison limits precision. The missing RSI data weakens overbought/oversold clarity, but the proximity to the SMA and tight price range points to **low volatility** and limited trend strength. Traders should watch for a return above the SMA to signal renewed positive momentum or a drop below recent intraday lows to confirm bearish continuation.\n\nFrom a horizontal levels perspective, **support lies near $8.90**, where recent intraday lows have formed a floor. A decisive break below this could open the way toward **$8.70–8.75** as the next relevant demand zone. On the upside, **resistance near $9.10–9.15** acts as the first hurdle; surpassing this with conviction could encourage short‑term buyers and challenge higher levels near **$9.40**. These zones frame the current trading range and help manage risk.\n\nFor practical trading suggestions, consider range‑based strategies in the current environment. **Short positions** could be favored on a clear close below $8.90 with volume confirmation, targeting the next support and a tight stop above $9.00. Conversely, **long entries** might be considered on a breakout above $9.15 with a stop under the breakout candle low. Keeping position sizes disciplined is key given the lack of strong directional momentum."

Provide technical analysis for Solana vs US Dollar (SOL/USD).\\n\\nCurrent Market Data:\\n- Latest Price: 99.33\\n- 24h Change: 1.56%\\n- High/Low: 99.46 / 97.78\\n- RSI(14): N/A\\n- MACD: -1.27639, Signal: N/A\\n- SMA(20): 100.43750\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1.

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSOL/USD’s **short‑term price action** shows a modest positive bias near *99.33*, with a 24‑hour uptick and tight range (high **99.46**, low **97.78**). Price remains slightly below the **20‑period simple moving average (~100.44)**, indicating mild near‑term selling pressure. Without a computed RSI and MACD signal line, the current MACD below zero suggests recent bearish momentum, though the minor positive daily change hints at consolidation rather than strong bearish continuation.\n\nLooking at **trend structure**, SOL’s behavior around the **SMA 20** suggests resistance is capping upside locally. Traders often view the SMA as dynamic resistance in choppy markets; a decisive breakout above the SMA 20 could rekindle short‑term bullish interest. Broader historical studies note key interest zones at levels like psychological **$100**, with meaningful resistance historically clustered above and support beneath this mark. Longer cycles have seen resistance near higher levels ($120+), but in the current frame the **$98–$100 zone** is pivotal.\n\nFrom an **indicator perspective**, the negative MACD component signals momentum skewed to the downside, while the lack of a signal line prevents a full crossover reading. If MACD crosses above its signal on lower time frames, buyers may regain control. Even absent the RSI, market participants should watch for momentum shifts near the moving average band: a sustained move above SMA 20 with volume could increase the odds of a rally toward near‑term resistance, while failure to hold above recent lows could stoke deeper retracement.\n\n**Support and resistance levels** to monitor: immediate support near the recent low around **97.5/97**, with stronger support if price dips below **95**. Near‑term resistance remains near SMA 20 *(~100–101)*; a clear break and close above here opens the door to **102–105** upside targets. For now, risk‑aware traders might consider range strategies — buying closer to support with tight stops and scaling out near resistance — or waiting for clear breakout confirmation before committing to trend trades. \n> **[Technical Analysis of Solana (COINBASE:SOLUSD) — TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/technicals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *tradingview.com*\n> Technical Ratings is a technical analysis tool that combines the ratings of several technical indicators to make it easier for traders and investors to spot profitable trades.

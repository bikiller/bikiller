The pair has been hovering under the **20‑period simple moving average (~9.46)**, suggesting **short‑term bearish bias** as sellers keep pressure above recent averages. The **24‑hour range** is tight, with limited volatility between **$9.15 and $9.19**, hinting at market indecision. Until price decisively steps above this SMA, the trend remains soft and consolidatory rather than trending strongly.\n\nOn momentum and oscillator structure, the available **MACD reading of –0.0598** indicates that bearish momentum still has the edge, despite the absence of a signal line for cross confirmation. Without a functioning **RSI**, we focus on price structure: rejection under short‑term moving averages and negative MACD suggests caution. If the MACD were to flatten or cross upward, it could mark an early turning point. For now, downside risks slightly outweigh upside potential, particularly as buyers have yet to reclaim average levels.\n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, near‑term support sits around **$9.10–9.15**, where recent price bounced before. A break below **$9.10** could expose **$9.00** as the next psychological level, with deeper support clustered around prior lows near **$8.75–8.80**. On the upside, initial resistance remains at the **20‑SMA (~9.46)**, followed by **$9.60–9.75**, where sellers previously emerged. A sustained break above **$9.50** would be the first sign that buyers are regaining control.\n\nFor traders, a prudent approach leans toward **range‑oriented strategies** until a clear breakout unfolds. Short‑term longs might look for dips near support zones with tight stops, while breakout buyers could wait for a close above **$9.50** with volume confirmation. Conversely, a close below **$9.10** might open short opportunities targeting **$9.00** and beyond. Keep risk disciplined and watch how momentum indicators evolve to signal trend shifts."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s current price action around **$85.41** suggests a market that’s paused after a recent attempt to reclaim higher levels. The narrow 24‑hour range (high **$85.49**, low **$84.85**) reflects limited volatility and possible consolidation near short‑term equilibrium. The fact that the price remains below the **20‑period simple moving average (~$88.06)** indicates that the recent bullish momentum has weakened, and the broader trend still favors the bears until a decisive move above that average occurs.\n\nLooking at momentum, the **MACD reading of -0.3546** in the absence of a visible signal line suggests residual bearish pressure, though the absence of a current signal value limits precise crossover interpretation. Assuming the MACD remains below its signal, this implies sellers still dominate short‑term sentiment. Without a reliable **RSI(14)**, we lean on price action and moving averages for clues: the inability to push above the SMA(20) points to subdued buying interest and potential continuation of the corrective phase unless buyers step in aggressively.\n\nOn support and resistance, the immediate zone around **$84.50–$85.00** appears to be acting as a near‑term floor, having contained recent dips. A move below this could open the door toward the **$80.00** psychological support, which aligns with prior congestion levels. On the upside, initial resistance sits at the **SMA(20)** near **$88.00**, followed by a key level around **$90.00**, where supply has previously capped advances. Monitoring volume around these levels can help confirm the strength of any breakout or breakdown.\n\nFor traders, a cautious approach is advisable: consider short‑term longs only on a clear breakout above **$88.50** with volume confirmation, targeting **$90–$92** with tight stops. Conversely, breakdowns below **$84.50** could favor short positions or protective hedges, aiming toward **$80.00**. Position sizing and risk limits remain crucial in this choppy environment, as trend direction is not yet clearly established."

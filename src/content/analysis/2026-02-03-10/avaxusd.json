Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$10.056** shows a market that’s stabilizing after a mild pullback. The short‑term trend has been relatively sideways with a slight downward bias, as recent candles are trading below the **20‑period simple moving average (SMA) at ~10.14**. This suggests sellers still have a slight upper hand, but the absence of sharp declines points to a lack of strong bearish conviction. Unless a breakout above the SMA occurs, expect continued choppy trading within the current range.\n\nLooking at momentum, the **MACD at ~0.013** remains slightly positive, hinting that underlying bullish momentum hasn’t completely faded despite the recent slide. The missing MACD signal line and RSI data limits full interpretation, but the current MACD value suggests buyers could regain control if momentum continues to build. In the absence of an RSI reading, watch for quick shifts in volume; stronger volume on upswings would support a bullish case, while weak uptake on rallies could reinforce the sideways to bearish view.\n\nOn support and resistance, key levels are emerging from recent price action. Immediate support sits around **$9.97**, the recent low where buyers stepped in. A break below this could open a slide toward **$9.50–9.60**, a zone of psychological support. On the upside, **$10.13–10.20** represents the first resistance cluster, with a stronger barrier near **$10.50**, where sellers historically re‑entered. Traders should watch these zones closely; intraday swings will likely respect them unless a catalyst disrupts the current equilibrium.\n\nFor trading suggestions, conservative participants might wait for confirmation — a clear close above the SMA or a bounce off support with volume — before committing. Short‑term scalpers could target range trades between support and resistance, keeping tight stops just beyond these levels. Longer‑term traders should consider positioning only after a decisive breakout, as the market currently lacks a clear directional bias."

Key watch: Whether SOL can convert the $90 resistance into support post-February 17, which would confirm the strength of the current rotation.\n\n交易建议上，短线交易者可以在85美元附近支撑测试时尝试小仓位多单，止损设在支撑下方适当距离以控制风险；突破90美元确认后，可考虑更明确的多头布局。反之若跌破支撑并伴成交量放大，则需警惕下探更低区域的可能。总体上建议配合风险管理和资金分配策略，不宜过度追高。"

      "title": "Solana vs US Dollar Technical Analysis",
      "content": "The current price of Solana (SOL) against the US Dollar stands at $84.95, showing a slight 24-hour decline of 0.39%. This price action is indicative of a relatively neutral market, with minimal volatility observed over the last 24 hours, as evidenced by the tight range between the daily high of $85.35 and low of $84.89. The price is hovering just above the 20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA), which currently sits at $84.82, suggesting a mild upward bias but lacking strong momentum. Traders should monitor how the price interacts with this moving average for possible support or resistance.\n\nIn terms of technical indicators, the absence of a clear Relative Strength Index (RSI) reading and the negative MACD of -0.01546 could signal a slightly bearish short-term outlook. The negative MACD suggests that the momentum is leaning towards downward pressure, although the lack of a clear signal line could result in volatility over the next few hours. It's crucial to watch for any divergence between price action and the MACD to gauge potential reversals or continuation patterns. However, without further confirmation, the market remains indecisive.\n\nKey support for SOL/USD lies near the low of the day at $84.89, with potential for a deeper pullback if this level fails to hold. If prices drop below this, the next major support is found around $84.50, a level that may attract buying interest. On the resistance side, $85.35 remains a critical barrier, and a successful breach of this level could open the door for a move toward $86.00 or higher. Traders should consider these levels for potential breakout or breakdown points, depending on intraday price action.\n\nIn the current market environment, a cautious approach is recommended. Given the lack of clear bullish signals and the presence of a slightly negative MACD, waiting for either a confirmed break above $85.35 or a bounce off the support zone near $84.89 could present more favorable entry points. Monitoring price action near these key levels will be crucial for determining the next trend direction."

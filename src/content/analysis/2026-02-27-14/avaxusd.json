Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$8.99** shows a short-term **bearish bias**, with the latest session slightly negative. The inability to sustain above the **20‑period simple moving average (~9.26)** suggests sellers remain in control near overhead resistance. Price has hovered within a tight range, which often precedes a breakout—yet the current drift indicates limited bullish conviction. In trend terms, AVAX remains below short-term averages, hinting that downward momentum could persist unless key levels are reclaimed.\n\nLooking at indicators, the **MACD reading of -0.0662** signals bearish momentum, although the absence of a signal line makes crossover interpretation incomplete. The negative MACD implies sellers currently outweigh buyers, and without a clear RSI to show oversold conditions, there’s no compelling evidence for an immediate rebound. Traders should watch for MACD flattening or turning positive as an early sign of shifting sentiment. Until then, downward pressure is likely to remain the dominant force in the near term.\n\nFrom a structural standpoint, immediate **support lies near the recent low around $8.98–$8.90**. A break below this zone could open room toward **$8.50**, a psychological level that may attract bids. On the upside, the first meaningful resistance sits at the **20‑SMA (~9.26)**, followed by **$9.50–$9.60**, where prior consolidation occurred. A decisive move above the 20‑SMA with volume would improve the short-term technical outlook and could attract additional buyers targeting the next resistance cluster.\n\nFor traders, caution is advisable given the muted range and bearish setup. Short-term sellers might consider entries on rallies up to the 20‑SMA, with tight stops above **$9.30** to manage risk. Conversely, aggressive long positions could look for signs of exhaustion near support or positive divergences on oscillators before committing. Overall, waiting for clarity—either a break above resistance or a breakdown below support—may provide a better risk‑reward entry."

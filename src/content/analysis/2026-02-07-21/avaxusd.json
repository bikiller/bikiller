Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s recent price action around **$9.24** suggests a market in mild consolidation. The short-term trend has been relatively flat, with prices oscillating near the 20‑period simple moving average at **$9.16**, indicating that buyers and sellers are in a temporary balance. The small negative 24‑hour change highlights slight bearish pressure, but the lack of a decisive move below recent lows suggests accumulation isn’t fully unwinding. A break below **$9.00** could signal deeper correction.\n\nThe MACD reading of **0.0599** shows continued positive momentum, even though the signal line isn’t available for full confirmation. This positive MACD, combined with price hovering above the 20‑SMA, implies that underlying bullish forces remain intact. Without an RSI value, caution is needed, but the current setup doesn’t show extreme overbought conditions. Traders should watch for MACD crossovers and eventual RSI readings to gauge shifts in momentum more reliably.\n\nKey support lies near **$9.00**, with a secondary base around **$8.75**, where buyers previously stepped in. On the upside, immediate resistance sits at the intraday high **~$9.32**, followed by a more meaningful cap near **$9.50–$9.60**, where selling pressure has historically emerged. Holding above the 20‑SMA and **$9.00** support zone would keep the bullish bias viable; a break above **$9.50** could trigger fresh interest from short‑term buyers targeting $10.00+ areas.\n\nFor traders, a patient approach makes sense given the current rangebound environment. Consider long positions near identified support with tight stops below $8.90 to manage risk, targeting $9.40–$9.60 for initial exits. Conversely, if price fails to hold support, short setups could be entertained with targets toward $8.75 and lower. Monitoring volume and upcoming momentum indicators will help confirm breakout or breakdown scenarios."

With the latest price around **77.98**, the inability to reclaim the SMA suggests the prevailing trend is leaning downwards until proven otherwise. Failure to hold current levels may amplify downside moves and reinforce the bearish bias. \n\nAlthough your provided MACD reading of **–1.0353** with no signal line limits precise crossover interpretation.com/solana-price-dex-volume-drop-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *beincrypto.com* · 2026/2/16\n> Solana price analysis reveals rising selling pressure after a 20% DEX volume drop. SOL now tests critical $84 support as key groups sell.\n\n\nAlthough your provided MACD reading of **–1.0353** with no signal line limits precise crossover interpretation, the negative MACD implies weakening momentum and unresolved selling pressure. Typically a MACD below zero indicates a dominant bearish phase, especially when accompanied by price below key moving averages.

Below this zone, a breakdown could accelerate declines toward deeper supports, potentially in the mid‑$60s if bearish conviction persists. On the upside, initial **resistance sits around $84–$85**, aligned with your SMA 20 and prior rejection area; sustained reclaim above this could shift short‑term bias back toward consolidation, with strongeristance near **$89–$90**. \n\nFor trading suggestions, risk‑adjusted strategies could favor short‑term range plays while volatility remains elevated. Consider setting tight stops if entering longs near support to guard against breakdown continuation, and looking for confirmation above $84 before adding longer entries.

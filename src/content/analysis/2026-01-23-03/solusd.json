After failing to sustain above the 20‑period simple moving average (~$128.72), price has been choppy with minimal directional conviction. With MACD still negative at **–0.216**, momentum lacks a clear bullish twist and signals ongoing caution among traders. The lack of a reliable RSI reading here means we should defer to broader price action and averages for trend cues. \n\nLooking at **support and resistance**, the **$127–$125 zone** acts as immediate support given recent lows and intraday swings, with a stronger floor near **$120** if sellers accelerate. Above current levels, resistance clusters begin around **$132–$135**, Technical Indicators.\n\n\nLooking at **support and resistance**, the **$127–$125 zone** acts as immediate support given recent lows and intraday swings, with a stronger floor near **$120** if sellers accelerate. Above current levels, resistance clusters begin around **$132–$135**, coinciding with recent moving average congestion and short‑term sellers. A convincing break above **$135** would open the door toward **$145–$150**, while failure to defend sub‑$127 could signal a deeper retracement. \n\nIndicator interpretation reinforces this cautious stance.

MACD below zero points to subdued bullish pressure, and with the price slightly under its 20‑period SMA, the near‑term bias favors consolidation or mild downside. A rising MACD histogram or crossover above its signal line would suggest a shift toward buyers. Volume profiles that show heavy activity around key pivot levels can also validate breakouts or breakdowns. Given current mixed signals, traders should monitor how these indicators evolve rather than act on a single trigger.\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, consider range‑based tactics until clear directional confirmation: buy near defined support with tight stops below $125, and scale into longs only on a break above5 with volume expansion. Shorter‑term traders may tighten risk exposure around resistance, taking profits in the range. For swing positions, patience is key — wait for confirmation such as MACD turning positive or a break above multi‑period moving averages before committing large capital. \n> **[SOLUSD Trader's Cheat Sheet for Solana - Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5ESOLUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Barchart.com* · 2025/12/11\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Solana - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators."

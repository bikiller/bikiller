Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action around **$81.05** suggests a **mild corrective phase** after a recent attempt to break higher. The 24-hour range between **$80.81 and $81.91** reflects **low volatility**, which often precedes stronger directional moves. From a broader perspective, the market has held above the 20-period simple moving average (**SMA 20 at ~80.37**), indicating that **short-term bullish bias remains intact** despite intraday weakness. Still, absence of significant upward momentum hints at consolidation rather than a fresh rally.\n\nLooking at technical indicators, the **MACD value of 0.047** (with no signal line provided) suggests **positive momentum**, though without the signal line we can’t confirm a clean crossover. This hints that **bulls retain subtle control**, but lack of divergence means strength is not robust. The missing **RSI reading** complicates momentum clarity, but price hugging its SMA suggests neither overbought nor oversold conditions. Market participants should watch how momentum evolves; a confirmed MACD crossover with increasing histogram bars could signal renewed buying interest.\n\nFrom a levels standpoint, immediate **support lies near the recent low at $80.81**, closely aligned with the SMA 20. A deeper test of support around **$79.50–$80.00** could attract buyers if broader crypto sentiment improves. On the upside, **resistance at $82.50** and more meaningfully near **$84.00–$85.00** would need to be cleared for a bullish continuation. A decisive break above these zones with volume could open room toward prior highs, reinforcing confidence in the uptrend’s resilience.\n\nFor traders, a disciplined approach is key. Bullish traders might consider **entries near support with tight risk controls**, especially if price shows a bullish candle or increased buying volume. Short-term traders could target the next resistance level, adjusting stops below $79.50. Conversely, a breakdown under $80 with conviction might invite short exposure, but only with clear confirmation to avoid whipsaw losses in this relatively calm market."

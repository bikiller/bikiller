      "content": "当前ETH/USD维持在2990附近震荡，价格稳站于短期均线上方，日内波动收敛，显示多空分歧加大。整体结构呈现高位整理特征，趋势上偏向震荡中继，短线仍由多头主导。\n\n技术指标方面，20日均线位于2938一线并持续上行，对价格形成动态支撑。MACD数值为正且处于扩散状态，动能仍偏多，但RSI数据缺失，需警惕动能边际放缓带来的回调风险。\n\n支撑位关注2975一线，与日内低点及短期成本区重合，失守将考验2935附近的SMA20。上方阻力位集中在3000心理关口及3020区域，若有效突破，行情或打开进一步上行空间。\n\n交易策略上，激进者可在2975-2990区间逢回调轻仓做多，止损设于2930下方；稳健者等待放量突破3000后顺势跟进。若跌破关键支撑，应暂避风险，转为观望。"

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nEthereum’s price action around **$2,990** suggests a cautiously bullish short-term trend, with the market holding above the 20-period simple moving average at **$2,937.92**. The recent 24-hour range shows relatively tight trading, indicating consolidation after a modest upside attempt. Buyers have defended intra-day support near **$2,978.68**, keeping structure intact. A sustained move above the **$3,000** psychological level could reinforce upward momentum.\n\nWhile the RSI(14) isn’t currently available, the MACD reading at **15.96** implies positive momentum, even without a visible signal line for cross confirmation. Coupled with prices above the SMA(20), this points to continued buyer presence. That said, the lack of multiple timeframe confirmation warrants caution: momentum could quickly fade if volatility spikes. Traders should watch for divergence or weakening MACD histogram bars as early signs of a reversal.\n\nKey support zones to monitor include the recent low around **$2,978–$2,980** and a deeper floor at the 20-SMA near **$2,937**. A break below these levels could open a slide toward **$2,900–$2,880**, where buyers previously stepped in. On the upside, immediate resistance resides near the 24-hour high at **$2,995**, followed by the **$3,020–$3,040** area, which has acted as resistance in earlier sessions. A clear breakout above this cluster would shift the near-term bias more convincingly bullish.\n\nFor traders, a balanced approach suits the current environment. Long entries could be considered on strong breaks above **$3,000** with volume confirmation, targeting higher resistance levels with tight risk management. Conversely, momentum-based short positions may be appropriate only if price closes below **$2,978** on increased selling pressure. Always adjust position sizes based on volatility and broader market cues."

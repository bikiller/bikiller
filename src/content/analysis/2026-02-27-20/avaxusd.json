      "title": "雪崩币/美元技术分析：短期震荡整理，缺乏明确趋势",
      "content": "当前，雪崩币/美元（AVAX/USD）价格维持在8.90附近，未显示出强烈的上涨或下跌趋势。短期内，市场似乎处于震荡整理阶段，缺乏足够的动能推动价格突破关键区间。随着24小时变动幅度仅为0.07%，市场情绪较为谨慎，交易量相对较低。\n\n从技术指标来看，当前缺少RSI数据，但MACD值为负（-0.105），这表明短期内卖方势力稍占上风。价格持续低于20日简单移动平均线（SMA），这通常意味着市场在短期内仍可能面临下行压力，特别是如果价格未能突破9.15的阻力位。\n\n支撑位方面，8.88是一个关键支撑区域，若价格进一步下探至此水平，可能会得到支撑反弹。若跌破此位，可能会加剧下行风险，寻找下一个支撑位7.80。而上行阻力则位于9.15，若突破该价位，可能会带来一定的反弹机会，挑战9.40。\n\n综合来看，短期内建议投资者保持谨慎，待价格突破关键支撑或阻力位后再做决策。如果突破9.15，可以考虑小范围的短期多单，但需注意风险管理。"

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action against the US Dollar remains subdued around the **$8.90** area, showing limited directional conviction over the past 24 hours. The modest **0.07%** change reflects a market lacking strong momentum, with the latest high and low tightly clustered between **$8.9062** and **$8.8875**. This compressive price structure hints at consolidation, likely after recent selling pressure. The short-term trend leans **bearish**, as the market trades below the **SMA(20) at $9.15**, suggesting sellers retain control in the near term.\n\nLooking at momentum, incomplete indicator data (RSI unavailable) complicates a full oscillatory view. However, the **MACD reading at –0.1053** indicates bearish momentum is still in play, even though the absence of the signal line limits precision. The price staying under the 20‑period simple moving average reinforces this cautious outlook, implying buyers are currently unable to push and sustain levels above recent averages. This dynamic often precedes attempts at downside tests, especially if volume remains thin.\n\nKey technical levels can act as practical anchors for traders. On the downside, an initial support zone emerges near **$8.80–$8.85**, where recent intraday lows have clustered; a breach below this could open psychological support around **$8.50**. On the upside, a breakout above **$9.15–$9.20** (SMA territory) would be needed to challenge resistance near **$9.50**, a level that previously capped rebounds. A sustained move above that could attract short‑term buyers targeting **$9.80–$10.00**.\n\nFor those considering entries, a **range‑bound strategy** might be most suitable while volatility sits low: consider **longs near support with tight stops** and capitalize on bounces toward the 20‑period average. Conversely, **breakdown traders** could look for momentum continuation if support fails decisively. Always manage risk, as crypto markets can shift rapidly with broader sentiment swings."

Provide technical analysis for Avalanche vs US Dollar (AVAX/USD).\\n\\nCurrent Market Data:\\n- Latest Price: 9.7653\\n- 24h Change: 0.29%\\n- High/Low: 9.8467 / 9.6488\\n- RSI(14): N/A\\n- MACD: -0.078925624, Signal: N/A\\n- SMA(20): 9.87186\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1.

Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s short‑term trend around **$9.76** shows mild consolidation after a slight uptick in the last 24 hours. Price has been oscillating below the **20‑period SMA at $9.87**, which suggests the immediate bias isn’t strongly bullish. The highs near **$9.84** and lows near **$9.65** form a narrow range, highlighting indecision among traders. Until a clear break above or below this range, expect choppy movement with limited directional momentum.\n\nMomentum indicators paint a cautious picture. With **MACD at –0.0789** and the signal line unavailable, there’s evidence of bearish pressure lingering in recent price action. The lack of an **RSI reading** limits insight into overbought/oversold conditions, but trading below the 20‑period SMA often aligns with mild weakness. If MACD begins to turn upward toward a crossover, it could hint at renewed positive momentum. For now, buyers should remain selective and attentive to shifts in momentum.\n\nKey levels to watch include the immediate **resistance at $9.87–9.90**, defined by the 20‑period SMA and recent highs. A daily close above this zone could attract short‑term buyers and open the door toward **$10.10–$10.20**. On the downside, **support around $9.65** anchors the current range, with psychological support near **$9.50**. A break below these levels risks deeper pullbacks toward $9.30 or lower, where buyers may re‑emerge.\n\nFrom a trading standpoint, consider range‑responsive strategies while price remains between support and resistance. Long positions near support with tight stops just below $9.60 can offer favorable risk/reward, but only if accompanied by improving volume and momentum. Conversely, short entries near resistance with stops above $9.95 can capitalize on weakness. Always manage position size and follow broader market cues to adapt swiftly if volatility picks up."

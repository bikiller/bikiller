      "title": "Avalanche vs US Dollar Technical Analysis",
      "content": "Avalanche (AVAX) has been trading in a relatively narrow range around $8.90, reflecting a consolidation phase after recent downward pressure. The current price sits just below the 20-day simple moving average of $8.9886, suggesting mild short-term bearishness. The market is showing limited volatility, with the 24-hour price change at 0.64% and highs and lows confined between $8.9035 and $8.843. Traders should note that lingering below the SMA could indicate the continuation of cautious sentiment until a decisive break occurs.  \n\nAlthough the RSI is unavailable, the MACD reading of -0.0704 hints at weak bearish momentum. The negative MACD suggests that short-term selling pressure is slightly outweighing buying interest, though the absence of a signal line makes crossovers inconclusive for immediate action. Observing intraday price movements around the MACD baseline can offer clues for potential momentum shifts. Coupled with low volatility, this indicates that the market may remain range-bound unless external catalysts push AVAX decisively higher or lower.  \n\nKey support levels are near $8.84, representing the recent intraday low, while immediate resistance aligns with the 20-day SMA at $8.9886. A break above this resistance could open a path toward $9.10–$9.15, while a breach below support may test $8.70. Traders should watch for volume spikes near these levels, which could confirm the strength of any breakout. The market is currently favoring a cautious approach, with small intraday trades likely being more effective than aggressive positions.  \n\nFor tactical considerations, short-term traders might focus on scalping around the $8.85–$8.99 range, while longer-term participants should monitor the SMA closely for trend confirmation. The slight bullish bounce from the intraday low suggests potential for minor upward moves, but confirmation above $9.00 would strengthen a positive outlook. Overall, the current picture favors range-bound trading with a close eye on moving average interactions and potential MACD shifts for early trend signals."

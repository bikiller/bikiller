Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nTrading **Solana (SOL/USD)** around **$85.78** suggests a short-term sideways consolidation after recent volatility. Price action slightly below yesterday’s high of **$85.97** and just above the low near **$85.69** reflects a narrow range with sellers and buyers in balance. The mild **24‑hour decline (-0.23%)** hints at hesitation rather than strong directional conviction. Overall, the trend still leans cautiously bullish as SOL holds above the **20‑period simple moving average (~$84.85)**, indicating short‑term support remains intact.\n\nLooking at indicators, the **SMA(20)** support zone around **$84.8–$85.0** has been tested but not decisively broken, which points to underlying demand at these levels. Although the **RSI(14)** isn’t currently available, the presence of price above the moving average suggests momentum isn’t deeply oversold. The **MACD reading (1.20132)** lacking its signal line limits full interpretation, but a positive histogram region typically suggests that shorter momentum still supports upward bias, provided the MACD doesn’t sharply turn downward.\n\nKey **support levels** to monitor would be the recent swing lows near **$84.5–$84.0** and psychological support at **$80.0**. Breaking and closing below these zones could accelerate bearish pressure and increase volatility. On the upside, **resistance** remains near **$88.0–$90.0**, where previous price rejections cluster. A decisive break above **$90.0**, especially on higher volume, could open the door toward a retest of **$95.0**+ levels and reinvigorate bullish sentiment.\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, a conservative approach would involve buying nearer the **$84.5–$85.0** support band with tight risk controls and targeting **$88.0–$90.0** on strength. Shorter‑term traders might consider fading the current range, selling near resistance and covering near support. If price breaks below **$84.0**, consider reducing long exposure or exploring short positions with stops above recent swing highs to manage risk properly."

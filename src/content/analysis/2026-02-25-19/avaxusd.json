Given the latest **SMA(20) at ~8.99**, the market is above this key moving average, hinting that the immediate trend still has room to hold above short‑term value area. However, broader price structure and recent corrective moves suggest the market lacks strong upside conviction right now, and volatility is compressed near the lows of the recent range. \n\nThe limited indicator data you supplied (MACD positive though signal not available) alongside broader external readings shows mixed momentum.

While a positive MACD reading suggests some bullish pressure, absence of a confirmed signal line crossover and neutral to weak readings from other sources imply momentum isn’t strongly supportive yet. External technical summaries show RSI levels teetering near neutral or modestly oversold zones and moving averages across multiple timeframes still tilting bearish. This divergence between short‑term moving averages and broader trend tools means buyers aren’tly in control. \n\nFor **support and resistance**, traders should watch **intraday support near $9.60 and the next tier around $9.30–$8.80**, which coincide with recent pivot metrics and lower Bollinger band thresholds. Resistance is likely capped near **$9.75–$9.90**, with larger hurdles emerging closer to the psychologically significant **$10–$10ance**, traders should watch **intraday support near $9.60 and the next tier around $9.30–$8.80**, which coincide with recent pivot metrics and lower Bollinger band thresholds.

Shorter‑term traders might consider modular buys on dips to support levels with tight stops below $9.30, targeting initial resistance zones. Conversely, sharp moves above **$10** could validate a breakout attempt and invite momentum traders to scale in on strength. If price breaks decisively below key support, risk management suggests minimizing long exposure until clearer structural confidence returns.

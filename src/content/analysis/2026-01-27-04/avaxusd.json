Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$11.78** shows a relatively flat trend in the very short term, with a negligible 24-hour change. The market appears to be in a **consolidation phase** after recent volatility, as the price hovers around the 20-period simple moving average at **$11.73**. This SMA support suggests that sellers aren’t aggressively pushing lower, keeping the current sideways momentum intact. A break above recent intraday highs could signal renewed bullish interest.\n\nWith the **MACD** currently at **0.0211** and lacking a defined signal line crossover, momentum isn’t strongly biased. This near-neutral reading supports the consolidation narrative: neither buyers nor sellers have firm control. In absence of the RSI figure, traders should watch for momentum shifts on shorter timeframes. If MACD rises above its signal line with expanding histogram bars, that could confirm a bullish shift from the current equilibrium.\n\nKey **support levels** to monitor include the recent low near **$11.78** and the 20-period SMA around **$11.73**. A decisive break below these, especially on higher volume, could open the door toward psychological support at **$11.50** or lower. Resistance lies just above current levels near **$12.00**, followed by a more significant barrier around **$12.25–$12.40**, where previous price rejections have occurred. These levels should be watched closely as potential inflection points for directional moves.\n\nFrom a **trading perspective**, range-bound strategies may be appropriate until a clear breakout materializes. Consider entering long positions only after a confirmed close above resistance with volume support, targeting incremental gains toward **$12.40**. Conversely, a break and retest of support could present short opportunities, with stops just above recent swing highs to manage risk. Always align position size with risk tolerance and broader market conditions."

This suggests short‑term momentum hasn’t fully regained bullish control, especially given the slight negative price change over 24 hours and the negative MACD value. The absence of a valid RSI reading complicates momentum interpretation, but the MACD being below zero implies residual downward pressure in recent sessions. Trend structure remains somewhat neutral to bearish unless price convincingly climbs above the recent moving average resistance. \n\nIndicator interpretation supports this cautious view.

A negative MACD generally indicates that short‑term exponential moving averages are weaker than long‑term ones, pointing to fading bullish momentum. Without a clear signal from RSI but with MACD in negative territory, there’s **no strong bullish confirmation at present**. Traders should watch for a bullish MACD crossover or rising RSI above the midpoint to signal improving trend strength. Until those appear, oscillators could continue reflecting indecision or mild bearish bias. \n\nKey technical levels frame the risk/rewardtm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *en.wikipedia.org*\n\n\nKey technical levels frame the risk/reward landscape. Near‑term **resistance resides around the recent swing highs near the 20‑SMA (~1.91–1.92)** and further up toward the $2.10–$2.25 area that has acted as a barrier in past cycles. On the downside, **support zones to monitor are the intra‑day low at ~1.8946 and broader psychological support near ~$1.80–$1.75**. A breach below these supports could expose lower levels, while overcoming the resistance cluster would shift the structure in favor of buyers. raders, a **neutral to cautious approach makes sense** right now. Range‑bound strategies between support and resistance may be more effective than directional bets. Breakouts above the 20‑period SMA or a confirmed MACD bullish signal could justify long entries with tight stops just below support. Conversely, failure to reclaim moving average resistance could offer short‑term sell or short opportunities with stops above recent highs. Always pair technical signals with volume confirmation and risk management. und strategies between support and resistance may be more effective than directional bets.

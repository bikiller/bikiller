The minor breakdown beneath the recent intraday range indicates sellers retain slight control, though broader support around $9.16 (20‑period SMA) cushions deeper declines. A sustained move below $9.16 could open the door to $9.00, a psychological support, while reclaiming $9.40/$9.45 would suggest renewed upside interest and a possible re‑test of $9.60.\n\nThe indicators paint a nuanced picture. MACD remains marginally positive at 0.0589, signaling underlying bullish divergence, but without a visible signal line and given the modest negative price change, momentum lacks conviction. The missing RSI complicates traditional overbought/oversold assessments, yet the proximity of price to the 20‑period SMA suggests equilibrium conditions. Traders should watch for an uptick in volume accompanying any MACD crossover above its signal line, which often precedes more decisive directional moves in choppy conditions.\n\nKey intraday support lies at the $9.16 SMA and extends lower toward the $9.00 round number, where demand clusters historically have appeared. Resistance is immediate near $9.40, with a stronger barrier around $9.60–$9.70, levels that have capped previous rallies. A failure to breach these caps could keep AVAX stuck in a range, emphasizing patience. On the downside, if $9.16 breaks with conviction, the next meaningful support zone could be found near the $8.80–$8.90 range, where longer‑term buyers have previously stepped in.\n\nFor traders, a conservative approach is prudent: consider limited long exposure near support with tight stops below $9.10, targeting $9.40 and $9.60 for partial profits. Conversely, momentum traders might wait for a clean break and retest above $9.45 before initiating fresh longs. Short positions could be explored on a confirmed break below $9.16, with an eye on $9.00 and $8.90 as potential profit areas, always managing risk carefully."

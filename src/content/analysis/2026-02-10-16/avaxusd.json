The pair is trading below the **20‑period SMA (~$8.90)**, which reinforces downside pressure and suggests sellers still control momentum. Without a reliable **RSI reading**, we must lean more on price structure, which currently tilts toward consolidation near recent lows rather than a sustained push higher. The broader trend remains weak until a break above short‑term averages. \n\nIndicator interpretation reinforces this cautious tone. Your MACD is still negative, signifying that downward momentum hasn’t decisively reversed, and the price sticking below the SMA20 confirms this bearish undertone. Historically, deeper support around higher timeframes often emerges near previous liquidity zones **well above current levels**, though short‑a, the outlook for AVAX remains weak due to significant downward price pressure and lack of immediate bullish indicators.\n\n\nIndicator interpretation reinforces this cautious tone. Your MACD is still negative, signifying that downward momentum hasn’t decisively reversed, and the price sticking below the SMA20 confirms this bearish undertone. Historically, deeper support around higher timeframes often emerges near previous liquidity zones **well above current levels**, though short‑term pivot support may exist at intermediate undershoots and psychological round numbers. Given the lack of bullish oscillator confirmation, buyers should remain selective and vigilant for divergence signals before committing. \n\nFor **support and resistance**, immediate support sits near today’s low **(~$8.70)** and extends toward stronger zones around the next psychological clusters if prices pull back, oftenst that a rebound may be imminent, but the persistent downward momentum raises concerns about the sustainability of any recovery. Given the current technical and fundamental data, the outlook for AVAX remains weak due to significant downward price pressure and lack of immediate bullish indicators.\n\n\nFor **support and resistance**, immediate support sits near today’s low **(~$8.70)** and extends toward stronger zones around the next psychological clusters if prices pull back, often identified slightly below **$8** in broader historical data. On the upside, reclaiming the **SMA20** and moving toward short‑term resistance near **$9.00–$9.15** is key before any meaningful swing can extend. A decisive break above these local ceilings could unlock a move to stronger resistances at higher bands if macro conditions improve. \n\nFrom a **tradingerformance and Relative Strength | RSI Hunter](https://rsihunter.com/asset/avax?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *rsihunter.com* · 2026/2/1\n> Such RSI levels typically suggest that a rebound may be imminent, but the persistent downward momentum raises concerns about the sustainability of any recovery. Given the current technical and fundamental data, the outlook for AVAX remains weak due to significant downward price pressure and lack of immediate bullish indicators.\n\n\nFrom a **trading suggestion** standpoint, this setup favors risk‑managed approaches. Shorter horizon players might look for bounces off confirmed oversold zones or trendline confluence with tight stops beneath local support. Breakouts above moving averages with volume confirmation could signal a shift toward range expansion. Longer‑term traders should watch for clear MACD crossover and RSI normalization above 50 before scaling in, as structural weakness remains until those momentum confirmations materialize. \n> **[AVAX Price Performance and Relative Strength | RSI Hunter](https://rsihunter.com/asset/avax?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *rsihunter.com* · 2026/2/1\n> Such RSI levels typically suggest that a rebound may be imminent, but the persistent downward momentum raises concerns about the sustainability of any recovery.

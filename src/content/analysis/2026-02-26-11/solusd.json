      "content": "当前，Solana/美元（SOL/USD）处于震荡整理的状态。价格在短期内波动较小，当前价格为86.86美元，24小时变化仅为-0.71%。从整体走势来看，SOL/USD在87.64和86.69之间区间波动，显示出市场的不确定性。\n\n技术指标方面，RSI（14）尚未更新，无法进行超买或超卖的判断。MACD显示为0.95583127，当前的MACD线高于信号线，表明短期内可能存在一定的买盘动能，但仍需进一步观察信号线的变化。SMA（20）为88.2755，价格略低于此水平，可能构成短期内的阻力位。\n\n支撑位方面，86.69为近期的低点，若跌破此位，可能会进一步测试较低区域的支撑；阻力位则位于87.64附近，突破该点位可能会引发价格向上波动。短期内，SOL/USD可能维持区间波动，投资者应保持谨慎，避免追高。\n\n总体建议，当前市场维持震荡状态，适合短期交易者进行区间操作。投资者可考虑在支撑位附近寻找买入机会，在接近阻力位时逐步卖出，待市场明确方向后再做进一步操作。"

Recent rejection around the **$90 area** suggests a developing lower‑high structure, a bearish continuation pattern unless bulls reclaim that zone. Persistence under the SMA(20) underscores this lack of upward conviction, with downside momentum likely to play out if key supports fail. \n\nLooking at momentum tools, the MACDd Drop to $67 After $90 Rejection](https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/analyst-warns-solana-sol-could-drop-to-67-after-90-rejection/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *livebitcoinnews.com* · 2026/2/25\n> A crypto analyst warns Solana may drop to $67 after failing at $90 resistance, with BTC weakness adding pressure on the bearish outlook.\n\n\nLooking at momentum tools, the MACD reading around 0.955 — even as a raw value without a signal line —ints at weakening trend strength in the immediate term. Typically, a positive MACD above signal suggests bullish bias, but without confirmation and with price below short‑term averages, this indicator is mixed at best. With the RSI unavailable here, traders should watch whether rising momentum can emerge alongside volume increases; absent that, momentum looks tepid and sidelined. \n\nOn support andL) Technical Analysis - Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/solana/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed SOL forecast as well as a Solana technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nOn support and resistance, **near‑term support sits near $84**, with a critical downside guard around ~$80–$79 — break below these could accelerate selling toward deeper levels near $67, as some analysts project if the bearish structure persists. On the upside, initial resistance lies at the **$90–$92 zone**, and a clear break above this range with sustained volume could shift the narrative toward short‑term recovery. Intermediate resistance near the SMA(20) also aligns with this zone, making it a key battleground for bulls. 0search11\n\nFrom a trading perspective, short‑term traders might consider **range‑based strategies** while the price remains bound by-volume-drop-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *BeInCrypto* · 2026/2/16\n> Solana price analysis reveals rising selling pressure after a 20% DEX volume drop.

Longer‑term participants should wait for a **confirmed breakout above $92** or a breakdown below $80 to define trend direction more clearly, as choppy price action could persist until one of those levels resolves with conviction. Risk management and keeping exposure modest is advisable given current volatility and liquidity dynamics. \n> **[Solana Price Rejected at a Critical Level as DEX Volume Drops 20% — What Next for SOL?](https://beincrypto.com/solana-price-dex-volume-drop-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *BeInCrypto* · 2026/2/16\n> Solana price analysis reveals rising selling pressure after a 20% DEX volume drop.

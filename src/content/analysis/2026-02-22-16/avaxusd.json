The inability to break back above this average suggests sellers are still in control, with lower highs forming over recent sessions. The narrow trading range between *8.85* and *8.89* reflects low momentum, and until a decisive breakout occurs, the prevailing trend leans mildly downward.\n\nThe **momentum indicators** paint a subdued picture. With MACD at *-0.0728* and no available signal line to confirm a cross, there’s a lack of bullish conviction right now. The missing RSI reading constrains a full view of overbought/oversold conditions, but given the sideways price behavior near recent lows, it’s reasonable to infer that momentum is weak and neutral to bearish. Traders should watch for MACD divergence or a clear signal line crossover as the first hint of trend exhaustion.\n\nOn the **support and resistance front**, immediate support resides around the recent swing low of *8.80–8.82*. A break below this could quickly test a psychological floor near *8.50*, where prior buyers have stepped in. Resistance is just above at *9.00–9.05*, coinciding with the 20 SMA and a cluster of short‑term highs. Only a sustained move above *9.10* would begin to shift the short‑term posture toward bullish, targeting *9.30* and beyond.\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, conservative participants might avoid fresh long entries until price closes above *9.05* with volume confirmation. Shorter‑term traders could consider scalps on fails at resistance, with tight stops just above *9.10*. If *8.80* breaks decisively, a short bias toward *8.50* may offer a cleaner risk‑reward. Always ensure risk management is in place, given the current lack of strong directional cues."

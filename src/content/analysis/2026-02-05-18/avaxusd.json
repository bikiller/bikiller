      "title": "雪崩币/美元技术分析：短期震荡整理，暂未出现明确方向",
      "content": "当前AVAX/USD在8.86附近震荡整理，价格波动较小，显示出市场暂时缺乏明确的方向。考虑到价格接近20日简单移动平均线(SMA 20) 9.38，短期内可能会面临一定的上行压力。如果突破该阻力位，则可能会迎来反弹，但如果未能突破，则可能会继续维持震荡整理格局。\n\n从技术指标来看，MACD处于负值区域，表明短期内市场的卖压较强。然而，RSI数据尚未提供有效的超买或超卖信号，意味着市场情绪较为中性。价格区间的窄幅波动也可能是市场等待新的驱动因素来确定方向。\n\n支撑位方面，8.82附近是当前的关键支撑区。如果价格跌破此水平，则可能会进一步下探8.70区域作为下一个支撑。而阻力位则主要集中在9.00至9.38区间，突破这些阻力位才能确认短期上涨趋势。\n\n综合来看，AVAX/USD在短期内可能继续维持震荡整理，交易者可以在支撑和阻力区间内寻找进出场机会。建议在价格接近支撑位时考虑适度买入，接近阻力位时则可考虑卖出或保持观望。"

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$8.87** suggests a short-term bearish bias despite a modest 0.43% 24‑hour uptick. The inability to reclaim the 20‑period simple moving average at **9.38** indicates sellers remain in control, with the recent high near **$8.90** acting as an immediate resistance. A closer look at price structure shows lower highs forming, which often signals weakening bullish conviction and potential continuation to the downside.\n\nThe **MACD’s negative value (-0.2388)** reinforces this cautious tone. Without a positive crossover or expansion of the histogram, momentum lacks bullish strength. The absence of an available RSI makes it difficult to confirm overbought or oversold conditions, but given the price trajectory and momentum, there’s room for additional downside before a true reversal can be validated. Traders should wait for a confirmed MACD shift above its signal to consider long entries with more confidence.\n\nKey support lies around the recent intraday low near **$8.82**, with a more meaningful floor closer to **$8.50–$8.60**, where prior congestion and psychological levels intersect. A break below these zones on increased volume could open the door to further losses toward the **$8.20** area. On the upside, overcoming the immediate resistance at **$8.90**, then the SMA(20) zone near **$9.38**, would be required to shift the near‑term outlook into neutral or bullish territory.\n\nGiven current signals, a conservative approach is advisable. Shorter‑term traders might consider light selling pressure on rallies up to resistance, keeping tight risk management in place. Longer positions are better suited to wait for a clear break and retest above the SMA and a confirming MACD crossover, ensuring entry only when momentum aligns with trend recovery."

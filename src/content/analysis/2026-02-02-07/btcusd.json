      "title": "比特币/美元技术分析：震荡整理，短期仍有承压",
      "content": "当前，比特币/美元的价格走势处于震荡整理状态，最新价格76394.02美元，全天变化幅度较小，只有-0.09%。从小时图看，BTC/USD在76232.47美元与76753美元区间内波动，显示出市场的短期观望情绪较重。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD目前为负值(-764.86950)，并未显示出明显的买入信号，且没有明确的信号线交叉，表明短期内市场情绪较为消极。SMA(20)在77085.35美元附近，价格尚未突破这一移动均线，显示出上行压力，可能会导致短期回调。\n\n从支撑与阻力的角度来看，当前支撑位在76230美元附近，而76750美元为近期的阻力位。若价格跌破支撑位，可能会进一步回调至75800美元附近；反之，若突破阻力，可能尝试挑战78000美元。\n\n总体而言，目前比特币在短期内缺乏强烈的趋势，建议短线交易者保持谨慎，等待更明确的突破信号。对于中长线投资者，可考虑在支撑位附近寻找买入机会，设定止损位以防风险。"

Prices cycling below this average and within a tight range between ~76,200 and ~76,800 suggest a consolidative environment rather than a decisive breakout. With broader market sentiment tilting risk-off and crypto underperforming relative to safe havens, downside pressure has increased. \n\nAlthough your RSI and MACD readings are incomplete, the negative MACD reading and price below the SMA(20) point to bearish momentum dominating intermediate timeframes.

Without a clear RSI pivot into oversold territory, upside capacity might remain constrained until buyers show strength above key moving averages. \n\n**Key support levels** to watch include the recent intraday low around *76,200*, followed by psychological floors near *75,000*.

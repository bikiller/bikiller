The modest 24‑hour gain of **0.83%** coupled with price resilience above recent lows indicates that traders are defending the area around **762–765** as a near‑term support zone. A convincing break above **780–790** could help shift the bias toward accumulation and an extension back into broader upside ranges. \n\nLooking at momentum, the MACD reading at **1.48586** (even without a comparative signal line) hints at continuing bullish energy, but the lack of a complete crossover picture calls for caution in interpreting strength.

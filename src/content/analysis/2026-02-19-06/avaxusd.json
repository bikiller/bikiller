      "content": "当前，雪崩币（AVAX）/美元的价格呈现震荡整理格局。最新价格8.9107接近短期均线SMA(20)的8.9365，显示出价格在此附近波动较小，缺乏强势趋势。日内价格波动幅度较小，反映出市场观望情绪较浓。\n\nMACD指标目前为负值（-0.053459135），表明短期内卖压较重，但因信号线数据缺失，尚无法确认是否存在持续下行趋势。RSI（14）缺乏数据，无法评估市场是否处于超买或超卖区间，从而影响价格动向的判断。\n\n从支撑和阻力的角度来看，当前支撑位在8.8701附近，而阻力位则大致在SMA(20)的8.9365及其上方。若价格跌破8.8701支撑，可能会进一步测试8.80美元区域。若突破8.9365上方阻力，则可关注9.00美元区域。\n\n建议短期交易者保持谨慎，建议观察价格是否突破当前的支撑或阻力位，突破后可寻找合适的入场时机。若价格维持震荡，则建议暂时观望。"

The pair has been struggling to stay above the 20‑period SMA (~8.94), suggesting sellers still dominate intraday momentum. Although price action shows a mild uptick in the last 24 hours, the broader picture drawn from multi‑source technical summaries leans toward a continuation of the downward grind unless buyers reclaim higher moving averages. \n\nLooking at indicators,l analysis — Daily Updates｜Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/price/avalanche/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *bitget.com*\n> AVAX/USD technical analysis This gauge displays a real-time overview of Avalanche technical analysis for your selected timeframe. The Avalanche summary is based on popular technical indicators, including moving averages, oscillators, and pivot points.\n\n\nLooking at indicators, MACD sitting in negative terrain implies that bearish momentum is still present, even if the histogram might be less severe than earlier periods. The lack of a clear RSI reading in your data complicates interpretation, but broader analyses generally place the RSI in neutral to slightly bearish ranges below overbought levels. This suggests that AVAX isn’t oversold enough to prompt a strong reversal on its own and may need volume support to shift momentum. \n\nKey support for AVechnical analysis | CoinLore](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/avalanche/technical-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *coinlore.com* · 2026/2/10\n> Technical analysis for Avalanche AVAX including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nKey support for AVAX is clustered just below current prices. Classical pivot studies and recent sentiment data point to support near **8.70–8.35**, which could act as the first line of defense in a downturn. On the upside, resistance is visible up toward **9.10–9.50**, where sellers have historically stepped in and where the SMA(20) lives as a dynamic ceiling. Breaking above 9.50 with conviction would be a constructive sign that short‑term selling pressure is diminishing. \n\nFrom a trading perspective, intraday traders might look for range plays between support and resistance, with tight stops just under the 8.70 zone if bearish momentum re‑accelerates. A break above the 20‑period SMA and a rising MACD crossover could open tactical long entries with targets toward the **9.30–9.50** band. Conversely, failure to hold support near 8.35 could usher in deeper retracements, so risk management should be disciplined with fixed stops and attention to volume confirming moves. rossover could open tactical long entries with targets toward the **9.30–9.50** band.

The narrow range between the high (9.307) and low (9.2535) on the latest session suggests low volatility and indecision. Overall structure remains flat to slightly bearish unless buyers reclaim consistent closes above recent highs. Broader trend context from technical aggregators still leans toward downside bias in daily signals. \n\nMomentum indicators paint a **mixed to weak picture**.

With the current RSI values showing oversold conditions but the longer-term trends remaining negative, the market sentiment appears to be cautious at best. Considering these factors, the rating for Avalanche (AVAX) is a Hold.\n\n\nKey **support levels** near the current price can be anchored around the psychological and technical zone of **$9.00–$8.85**, a region that has absorbed selling pressure in recent sessions. Falling below this cluster could expose deeper supports around $8.55 and $8.36. On the **upside**, selling interest is likely near **$9.30–$9.35**, followed by stronger resistance above the mid‑$9s. Breaks beyond these areas would help confirm tactical direction shifts. \n\nFrom a practical trading standpoint, consider **range‑responsive strategies** until a clear breakout occurs. Long entries near the lower support band with tight risk management favor those targeting swings toward the upper range. Conversely, short exposures on failure to clear immediate resistance can work in choppy conditions. Traders seeking trend shifts should watch for MACD crossing above a proper signal line and sustained closes above the SMA(20) to imply renewedwings toward the upper range.

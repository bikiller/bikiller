Price is hovering near the 20‑period simple moving average (~80.39), showing that short‑term momentum isn’t decisively trending up or down. The failure to gain ground above recent highs and persistent rejection in higher timeframes suggests **neutral to bearish pressure** near current levels. With broader market risks and altcoin consolidation, trend direction remains **cautiously sideways to mildly negative** in the near term. \n\nLooking at the limited indicator set, the **MACD reading in negative Critical Support Zones Ahead](https://blockonomi.com/solana-price-analysis-sol-slides-5-amid-middle-east-tensions-critical-support-zones-ahead/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *blockonomi.com* · 2026/2/28\n> Solana (SOL) drops 5% to $78 amid Middle East tensions. Analysts identify key support at $50, $22, and $10 as network activity remains strong.\n\n\nLooking at the limited indicator set, the **MACD reading in negative territory (~‑0.696)** signals that downward momentum is still present and sellers retain control. Without a valid RSI reading, we lean on the moving average context: trading around the SMA(20) and under key resistance zones makes upward breakouts less reliable until volume picks up. Historically, indicator clusters below key averages reflect **bearish or neutral sentiment unless reversed sharply by renewed buying**. \n\nFor **support levels**, very near‑term floors cluster around the low of the recent range (~80.8) and broaderonomi.com/solana-price-analysis-sol-slides-5-amid-middle-east-tensions-critical-support-zones-ahead/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Blockonomi* · 2026/2/28\n> Solana (SOL) drops 5% to $78 amid Middle East tensions. Analysts identify key support at $50, $22, and $10 as network activity remains strong.\n\n\nFor **support levels**, very near‑term floors cluster around the low of the recent range (~80.8) and broader psychological points like ~$76–78, where earlier swing lows have shown defense. Major deeper supports exist in broader historical zones around ~$50 and lower if liquidations accelerate. On the upside, key **resistance sits around ~$84–90**, a zone where price rallies have repeatedly stalled. A break above these levels with strong volume would be needed to shift towards a bullish bias. \n\nIn termsna Price Analysis: SOL Slides 5% Amid Middle East Tensions – Critical Support Zones Ahead](https://blockonomi.com/solana-price-analysis-sol-slides-5-amid-middle-east-tensions-critical-support-zones-ahead/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Blockonomi* · 2026/2/28\n> Solana (SOL) drops 5% to $78 amid Middle East tensions. Analysts identify key support at $50, $22, and $10 as network activity remains strong.\n\n\nIn terms of **trading suggestions**, riders might consider *range‑focused approaches* until directional clarity improves. Conservative traders could use tight stops below recent support bands and layer partial longs near support with predefined risk limits. Breakout traders could watch for a clean reclaim of resistance over ~$90 with increased volume to confirm upside momentum before entering larger positions. Conversely, a breakdown below the $76–78 zone could validate a bearish continuation setup, suggesting more aggressive short exposures. \n> **[Solana Price Analysis: SOL Slides 5% Amid Middle East Tensions – Critical Support Zones Ahead](https://blockonomi.com/solana-price-analysis-sol-slides-5-amid-middle-east-tensions-critical-support-zones-ahead/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Blockonomi* · 2026/2/28\n> Solana (SOL) drops 5% to $78 amid Middle East tensions.

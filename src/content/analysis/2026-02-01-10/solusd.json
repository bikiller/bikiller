      "content": "你好[鲜花], the Solana (SOL/USD) market is currently facing a slight downtrend as the price has decreased by 1.91% in the last 24 hours. The price is hovering near the 103.65 level, which is close to the day's low of 103.41. Given the absence of RSI and the unclear MACD data, we observe that the trend is somewhat neutral at the moment, with potential for either a continuation or reversal depending on future momentum.\n\nThe immediate support level for Solana is at 103.41, which has been tested recently and may act as a strong cushion for the price. If this level holds, we could see a potential rebound toward the next resistance zone at 105.75. A break above this level could lead to a short-term rally, with the next target around the 106.5 to 107 range. On the downside, a failure to maintain support at 103.41 could open the door for further decline, possibly reaching 102.00.\n\nWith the MACD showing a negative reading of -2.0033419, it suggests that bearish momentum is currently in play, albeit weakly. The absence of the RSI indicator leaves us with an incomplete picture, but based on the current MACD signal, the market sentiment leans toward caution. If the price does manage to stay above the 103.41 support and the MACD begins to show a positive divergence, there might be an opportunity for a cautious long position.\n\nTraders should remain vigilant around the support level of 103.41 and watch for signs of a reversal. If the price stabilizes and breaks above 105.75, entering long positions could offer a favorable risk-to-reward ratio. Conversely, if the price breaks down through the support, traders may look for short opportunities with targets near 102.00."

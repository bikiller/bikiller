Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nXRP/USD is showing a **neutral-to-slightly-bearish trend** on the short term as price consolidates below the SMA(20) at **1.378**. The market has struggled to sustain levels above this moving average, suggesting that buyers momentarily lack conviction to push higher. The narrow daily range reinforces a period of **sideways action**, with neither bulls nor bears fully commanding momentum.\n\nThe **MACD’s negative reading** around -0.0065 indicates mild bearish pressure, even as the absence of a signal line value limits resolution. Despite a modest 0.14% uptick in the last 24 hours, the inability to break above recent highs suggests sellers still defend elevated prices. In this context, momentum indicators would likely *refresh into bullish territory* only after a clear move above the SMA and rising MACD histogram bars.\n\nSupport and resistance levels are clearly defined within the current trading band. Immediate support lies near **1.3490**, reflecting the day’s low and a psychological pivot. A stronger support zone emerges toward **1.330–1.340**, where buyers previously stepped in. On the upside, resistance near **1.360–1.370** encapsulates recent highs and the SMA(20) zone. A break above this cluster could attract short-term buyers targeting **1.390–1.400**.\n\nFor traders, a **range-trading approach** makes sense while XRP remains beneath key moving averages. Consider buying near support with tight stops below 1.345, targeting the 1.360–1.370 range. Alternatively, *aggressive shorts* could be sized only upon failures at resistance and a resumption of lower lows. Risk management is vital — maintain stops and respect the trend until momentum indicators confirm a clear directional shift."

Price hugging the 20‑period simple moving average at **$891.30** suggests short‑term equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The narrow daily high/low range (892.69/891.80) reinforces that sentiment, hinting the market is waiting for a catalyst before committing directionally. Overall, the trend is **neutral to slightly bullish**, given price staying above the short‑term SMA with minimal downside follow‑through.\n\nLooking at the **MACD**, the positive value of **0.6559** indicates that recent momentum still favors the upside, even though the signal line is unavailable for a crossover readout. Without an RSI to reference, this MACD reading alone suggests that underlying bullish pressures remain, albeit modest. Traders might view this as latent strength that hasn’t fully translated into directional conviction. If momentum expands, a sustained uptick above recent highs could trigger stronger directional moves.\n\nFrom a **support and resistance** standpoint, immediate support sits near **$890–$891**, a zone reinforced by the short‑term moving average and recent intraday lows. Below that, stronger support could be found around **$880–$885**, where buyers previously stepped in. On the upside, initial resistance is the recent high near **$893–$895**; breaking and holding above **$900** would signal renewed bullish interest. A failure to hold $890 could expose the pair to deeper retracement toward the mid‑$870s.\n\nFor **short‑term traders**, consider a range‑bound approach: favor long positions near support with tight stops, and take partial profits near resistance until a clear breakout materializes. If a decisive close above **$900** occurs with volume confirmation, a measured long bias makes sense; conversely, a close below **$885** might shift focus toward short opportunities with defined risk limits."

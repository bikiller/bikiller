Price action’s tight 24‑hour range and minimal change suggest indecision among market participants. Without a confirmed higher high above recent swing highs, the trend lacks strong bullish confirmation and may be consolidating near current support zones. A break below support could signal increased downward momentum.\n\nThe **MACD reading at –0.5027** reflects ongoing **bearish momentum**, even though the absence of a signal line reading limits complete interpretation. Typically, a negative MACD indicates sellers still hold a slight edge and that momentum has not yet turned positive. In contexts where RSI is unavailable or neutral, longer‑term moving average patterns and volume shifts become more critical for trend validation. Traders should watch for a MACD crossover back toward positive territory as an early sign of a shift in control.\n\nKey **support** appears near the **$75–$85** zone, where buyers have historically stepped in to defend price and limit deeper drawdowns. A decisive close below this range could expose lower levels and invite further selling pressure, potentially toward mid‑cycle lows. On the upside, **immediate resistance** clusters near **$90–$95**, with stronger barriers emerging near prior consolidation highs. A sustained break above these levels could fuel renewed upside interest, especially if broader market conditions improve.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑bound strategy** may be appropriate given current volatility and lack of clear directional bias. Short positions could be considered on clean breaks below support with volume confirmation, while **long entries** might be justified only on confirmed breaks above resistance with improving momentum. Risk management is key, as macro events like large token unlocks could amplify selling pressure and affect these technical levels. \n> **[Will Solana (SOL) Reach $200 in 2026?

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nThe AVAX/USD market currently reflects a **short-term bearish bias** as price trades below the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA) at **8.5244**, signaling that recent momentum favors sellers. The latest price at **8.3351** slightly undercuts the previous session’s range, suggesting a lack of bullish conviction despite minor intraday pullbacks. Overall, the trend appears **range‑bound to mildly negative** unless key levels break decisively, with sellers maintaining slight control around the mid‑$8s.\n\nLooking at momentum, incomplete indicator data requires cautious interpretation. The MACD value at **–0.1024** suggests that the short‑term trend is losing bullish energy and tilting toward bearish momentum, even though the signal line isn’t provided. This negative MACD reading often precedes downward pressure when momentum diverges from price support. A fully formed RSI would help confirm oversold or overbought conditions, but in its absence, traders should be mindful that momentum is currently not supportive of strong upside moves.\n\nCritical **support levels** to watch are near **8.20–8.25**, where recent intraday lows clustered and could offer a floor if selling intensifies. Below that, round‑number interest at **8.00** may attract bids. On the upside, **8.50–8.55** remains a first **resistance zone** anchored by the 20 SMA, with more significant resistance near **8.75–8.80**, where recent supply previously capped advances. Breaking and holding above **8.55** would be necessary to shift the bias back toward neutral or mildly bullish on intraday charts.\n\nFor traders, a **risk‑managed approach** is prudent. Short‑term traders might consider **scalps near resistance**, aiming for tight targets toward support, with stops just above 8.60. Conversely, breakout buyers could wait for a sustained move above the 20 SMA and subsequent resistance, signaling a potential trend change. Given current momentum cues, **favoring lower‑risk short exposure or range‑trading strategies** until clearer directional confirmation emerges may be the most effective path."

Provide technical analysis for Avalanche vs US Dollar (AVAX/USD).\\n\\nCurrent Market Data:\\n- Latest Price: 8.8439\\n- 24h Change: 0.24%\\n- High/Low: 8.9063 / 8.7431\\n- RSI(14): N/A\\n- MACD: -0.053460925, Signal: N/A\\n- SMA(20): 8.84758\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1. Write 3-4 paragraphs, 60-80 words each, total 250-300 words\\n2. Include: trend analysis, indicator interpretation, support/resistance levels, trading suggestions\\n3. Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$8.84** suggests a period of consolidation after recent volatility. The pair has been oscillating tightly between the **$8.74 support** and **$8.90 resistance**, indicating indecision among traders. While the short-term trend lacks a decisive directional bias, higher lows forming over the past sessions hint at a subtle bullish undertone. If buyers can push above **$8.90–$9.00**, we could see renewed upside momentum toward **$9.20–$9.40**.\n\nThe SMA(20) at **8.8476** is currently acting as a dynamic pivot, with price hovering around it. This alignment reflects equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Without a valid RSI or MACD signal line, we rely on price structure and moving averages. The negative MACD value indicates that bearish momentum recently dominated, but the absence of a signal line limits clarity. Traders should watch for MACD histogram contraction or a crossover as confirmation of a shift toward bullish momentum.\n\nKey support levels to monitor include **$8.74**, followed by **$8.60** and **$8.40** if selling pressure intensifies. On the upside, **$8.90** is the immediate hurdle, with more formidable resistance near **$9.20** and **$9.40**. Breakouts beyond these zones with solid volume could signal continuation of the prevailing directional move. Conversely, a break below **$8.60** might open the door to deeper correction, potentially targeting the $8.40 zone.\n\nFor traders, a conservative approach is advisable. Consider **long positions on dips near support**, with tight risk management below **$8.60**, targeting **$9.20** and higher. Short-term scalpers may find opportunities within the range, fading extremes between support and resistance. Longer-term traders should wait for a confirmed breakout with volume and supportive oscillator signals before committing significant capital."

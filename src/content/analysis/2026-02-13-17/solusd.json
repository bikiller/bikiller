The 24‑hour change of +0.15% alongside a high of $84.65/$83.50 low suggests **intra‑day equilibrium** between buyers and sellers. The fact that price remains above the SMA(20) at **~$80.22** supports the medium‑term upside, indicating recent strength. However, the muted move and lack of volatility hints at market **consolidation** rather than a clean breakout.\n\nFrom an **indicator perspective**, the available MACD reading of 1.12567 (with no signal line published) generally shows positive momentum, as values above zero imply buyers carry some momentum. The absence of a signal line means we cannot confirm a classic crossover, but maintaining positive MACD while price hovers above the 20‑period moving average reinforces **underlying bullish undercurrents**. The missing RSI(14) limits overbought/oversold insights, but sideways action suggests neither extreme condition currently dominates.\n\nOn levels, near‑term **support** can be viewed around the 20‑period SMA close to **$80.0**, followed by psychological support at **$78.00–$77.50** where recent buyers were active. Immediate **resistance** resides at the **$85.00–$85.50 zone**, a cap formed by recent highs, with a stronger barrier near **$88.00** where selling pressure previously emerged. A clean break above $85.50 with volume would open the path toward that $88 area, while breakdown below the $80 region risks a deeper test.\n\nIn terms of trading suggestions, disciplined participants might look for **pullbacks** toward the moving average for swing entries, ideally with confirming MACD momentum staying positive. Short‑term scalpers could play the range between $83.50 and $85.50 until a breakout materializes. Protecting capital with **stops below key support** (e.g., $79.00) is sensible, while breakout traders should wait for clear closes beyond resistance with volume to avoid false moves."

The recent candles show a tight range between the high of 9.2075 and low of 9.1433, suggesting reduced volatility and buyer/seller equilibrium. The fact that the latest price (9.1741) sits above the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA20 at **8.9098**) reinforces mild upward pressure, but the market lacks strong directional conviction in the absence of follow‑through volume.\n\nLooking at the **momentum indicators**, the MACD line at **0.0813** remains in positive territory, implying that shorter‑term momentum is above the longer average. However, without the MACD signal line or RSI values, momentum confirmation is limited; traders should treat MACD’s current status as tentative. If MACD continues rising and an RSI reading enters mid‑to‑upper levels (50–70), it would strengthen the case for continuation. For now, momentum signals hint at stabilization rather than decisive acceleration.\n\nKey **support and resistance levels** to watch are clustered near psychological and recent swing points. Immediate support lies near the intraday low of **9.1433**; a break below here could open the door to the SMA20 (~8.91) and then the 8.70–8.80 zone. On the upside, resistance initially sits at 9.20–9.25, with a more meaningful barrier around 9.40–9.50, where prior congestion occurred. A sustained break above 9.25 with volume would suggest renewed bullish interest and potential for a run toward 9.60.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑based approach** makes sense in this phase. Long positions could be considered near support (9.14–9.00) with tight risk management, targeting 9.25–9.40. Conversely, short setups might look to resistance (9.20–9.25) with stops just above and targets back toward support. Given the current lack of strong trend and partial indicator data, keeping position sizes moderate and watching for confirmed breaks before committing larger capital is prudent."

The fact that price sits **below the 20‑period simple moving average (~86.29)** suggests the short‑term trend remains bearish unless buyers reclaim that average as support soon. Broader frameworks from other technical summaries also lean bearish on moving averages overall, reinforcing this cautious backdrop. \n\n **[SOL USD Binance Technical Analysis - Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/solana/sol-usd-technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed SOL USD forecast as well as a Solana US Dollar Binance technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nWith the limited indicator data provided, the **MACD reading at −3.63** indicates downside pressure; in a typical setup that suggests bearish momentum is outweighing buyers. Without a valid RSI figure here, we lean on corroborative external sources that often show mixed or oversold RSI conditions on broader charts — a scenario that can sometimes precede short‑term bounces but does not confirm trend reversal by itself. Traders should be cautious about assuming oversold conditions alone will trigger a sustained rebound. \n\nKey **support levels** to monitor for SOL/USD near current prices include psychological floors like **$75–$80**, where recent trading hasrce=chatgpt.com)** · *tipranks.com* · 2026/2/2\n> Get a technical analysis of Solana (SOL-USD) with the latest MACD of -5.20 and RSI of 26.25.

On the upside, resistance is likely to emerge around the **$85–$90 zone**, defined by the 20‑SMA and recent swing highs, with further hurdles at higher pivot zones if broader strength returns. These levels act as guides for potential entry or exit zones in range‑bound conditions. \n\nGiven the neutral to bearishfor Solana - Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5ESOLUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *barchart.com* · 2026/1/25\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Solana - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators.\n\n\nGiven the neutral to bearish technical framework, a conservative **trading approach** would be to wait for **clear confirmation of trend change** — such as a break and hold above $86 with increasing volume — before initiating aggressive long positions. Short‑term traders might look for oversold bounces toward resistance for quick profit taking, while risk‑managed shorts could be considered if price breaks decisively below key local support with confirming momentum indicators.

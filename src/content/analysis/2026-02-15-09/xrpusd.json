Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nXRP/USD is currently navigating a mild corrective phase after recent upside gains, trading near **$1.60**. The price action shows short-term resistance around **$1.62**, which has capped strength today, while the recent swing low near **$1.58–$1.56** acts as immediate support. The broader trend still exhibits bullish elements, with higher lows underpinning momentum since the last consolidation. Sustained closes above **$1.62** could signal resumption toward the next resistance cluster near **$1.68–$1.70**.\n\nThe 20-period simple moving average at **$1.528** remains below the current price, indicating that the short-term trend favors buyers and that pullbacks are finding dynamic support. The MACD value is positive (**0.0445**), suggesting that upward momentum persists despite the slight 24-hour decline. Without a signal line or RSI reading, momentum interpretation relies strongly on price structure and moving average behavior; the upward slope of the SMA supports continuation bias while today's rejection at the recent high hints at selling pressure resuming in the short term.\n\nImmediate support is visible near **$1.58**, followed by deeper support levels at **$1.55** and **$1.50**. These areas coincide with prior demand zones that previously absorbed selling. On the upside, breaking and holding above **$1.62** opens the path toward **$1.68** and potentially **$1.75** if buyers regain conviction. Traders should be cautious around the **$1.62–$1.65** area, as this zone has flipped between support and resistance, indicating market indecision.\n\nIn terms of strategy, consider scaling into long positions on pullbacks closer to **$1.58–$1.55** with tight risk management, and look for confirmation of strength if price decisively breaks higher on increased volume. Short-term pullbacks could offer counter-trend opportunities if momentum weakens, but overall positioning favors buyers as long as price stays above key support levels."

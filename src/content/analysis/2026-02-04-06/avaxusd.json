The current structure suggests sellers remain in control, as price has failed to build meaningful upside conviction above recent swings and continues to chop sideways near critical lows. Broader structure on higher timeframes has been marked by lower highs and lower lows, which reinforces the downside bias unless a breakout is confirmed above key resistance bands. \n\nIndicator interpretation adds nuance: the available MACD reading is near zero](https://blockonomi.com/avalanche-faces-bearish-setup-below-10-despite-etf-and-rwa-adoption-boom/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *blockonomi.com* · 2026/2/1\n> Avalanche price remains weak despite ETF inflows and rising RWA TVL, with traders eyeing lower liquidity zones below key support levels.\n\n\nIndicator interpretation adds nuance: the available MACD reading is near zero but lacks a clearly upward signal, pointing to limited bullish momentum at this stage. Without a valid or signal line crossover, momentum remains subdued, and the SMA(20) proximity suggests a neutral to slightly bearish tilt within the current range. This compact movement typically signifies market indecision, where neither bulls nor bears have secured authority, but prevailing sentiment remains wary. Traders should watch for divergence readings that might precede a shift, though these are not yet evident. \n\nIn termsanche (AVAX) Technical analysis | CoinLore](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/avalanche/technical-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *coinlore.com* · 2026/2/2\n> Technical analysis for Avalanche AVAX including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nIn terms of support and resistance, immediate support clusters around **$9.90 to $9.50**, zones that have historically acted as demand floors could pause any sharp declines. A breakdown below these could expose deeper levels, potentially toward the psychological **$8.50–$8.00** area where liquidity often accumulates. Conversely, initial resistance lies near the recent highs around **$10.10–$10.60;** only a convincing break above this band would invite buyers back and open paths toward higher structural resistance. \n\nFor trading suggestions, short‑term traders might consider range‑bound strategies betweenhe/technical-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *CoinLore* · 2026/2/2\n> Technical analysis for Avalanche AVAX including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nFor trading suggestions, short‑term traders might consider range‑bound strategies between established support and resistance until a clear trend emerges, such as buying near support with tight stops below **$9.50** and targeting the **$10.50–$10.60** range. More aggressive entries could be considered on a breakout above **$10.60** with confirmed volume acceleration, signaling potential relief rallies. On the downside, stops might be placed just under **$9.40** to limit risk, given the broader bearish structure in play. Adjust positions according to volatility and risk tolerance, given the current lack of a decisive trend."

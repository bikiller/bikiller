The recent range between $87.64 and $88.38 reflects low volatility and indecision. From a trend perspective, the short-term structure leans slightly bullish as prices hover above the 20‑period simple moving average at $86.34, indicating that buyers have not fully relinquished control despite recent consolidation.\n\nAlthough the RSI(14) isn’t available, the SMA(20)’s position suggests **underlying support just below current levels**, which may attract accumulation if sellers push lower. The MACD reading of 1.33264 without a signal line makes interpretation incomplete, but a positive MACD number generally implies upward pressure. Traders should be cautious until the MACD crosses decisively and aligns with momentum indicators like RSI signaling either oversold or overbought conditions.\n\nKey short-term **support sits near $86.50–$86.00**, anchored by the SMA(20) and recent swing lows. A deeper breach toward $85.00 could open the door to $83.00. On the upside, **immediate resistance appears at $88.50–$89.00**, followed by a more significant hurdle near $90.50. A clear break above $90 would bolster confidence in continuation toward higher targets, while failure to reclaim $89 might keep price range‑bound.\n\nFor traders, consider a **neutral bias with confirmation**: long entries on dips near support with tight risk management, especially if volume increases and indicators improve. Shorter‑term scalpers might exploit the current range, selling near resistance and buying near support. Longer‑term positions should await clearer signals — notably a cross in the MACD with a rising RSI — before committing to larger directional trades."

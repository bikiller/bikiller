Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nThe **SOL/USD** pair currently shows a mild **bullish tone in the short term**, holding above recent consolidation around the $88–$89 zone. Price action attempted to push toward $90.95 but faced resistance, pulling back slightly to trade near $89.53. This suggests **range-bound behavior between $88.00 and $91.50** for now, with no decisive breakout yet. A close above the 20‑period SMA near $90.95 would add conviction to a rising trend continuation.\n\nFrom a **momentum perspective**, the absence of a reliable RSI reading limits clarity, but the modest 1.39% gain over 24 hours reflects cautious buyer interest. The **MACD reading at –1.525** indicates that bearish momentum still lingers beneath the surface. Without a confirmed signal line, this suggests that any rally may be tentative until buyers can meaningfully shift momentum. Traders should watch for a positive MACD crossover as an early sign of renewed bullish strength.\n\n**Support and resistance levels** are currently defined by near-term swing points. Immediate support sits around **$88.00–$88.50**, where recent lows have held. A deeper support cluster near **$85.00** aligns with the prior consolidation zone and could attract bids if volatility increases. On the upside, key resistance levels to monitor are **$91.50** and then **$93.00–$94.00**, where sellers have historically emerged. A clean break above these would open the door toward the psychological $100 level in a sustained run.\n\nFor **trading strategies**, conservative traders might prefer to wait for a breakout above $91.50 with volume confirmation before entering long positions. Alternatively, scalpers can take advantage of the current range by buying near support and trimming near resistance, using tight stop‑losses below $87.50. If the price slips below $88.00 on strong momentum, tightening risk management and considering short positions could be prudent. Overall, watch indicator crossovers and breakout confirmations for clearer directional signals."

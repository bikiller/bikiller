      "title": "以太坊/美元技术分析：短线偏弱、震荡下行",
      "content": "从价格结构看，ETH/USD当前运行在短期均线下方，反弹力度有限，显示空方仍占主导。24小时小幅回落且高低点区间收窄，说明市场处于弱势震荡阶段，短线趋势偏空，但尚未形成加速下跌。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD数值处于明显负区间，动能柱偏弱，反映下行动能仍在释放。RSI数据暂缺，但结合价格未能重回SMA20之上判断，市场买盘意愿不足，短期情绪偏谨慎。\n\n关键支撑位关注2790一线，该位置接近近期低点，若有效跌破，可能下探2760区域。上方阻力首先在2800，其次是SMA20附近的2900区域，若无法站稳，反弹大概率受阻回落。\n\n交易策略上，短线以谨慎为主，激进者可在反弹至阻力区轻仓试空，止损设于2900上方。稳健交易者建议等待价格企稳并重新站上均线后，再考虑顺势做多，以控制风险。"

      "title": "Ethereum vs US Dollar Technical Analysis",
      "content": "Ethereum is currently experiencing a slight downtrend, with a 24-hour change of -0.14%. The price has been fluctuating between a high of 2800.31 and a low of 2790.89, reflecting a narrow trading range. The price remains well below its 20-period simple moving average (SMA) of 2904.50, suggesting a bearish short-term sentiment. This could indicate ongoing pressure from sellers, but the price is not yet at extreme levels, offering potential for a rebound if broader market conditions improve.\n\nThe absence of a clear RSI (14) reading makes it difficult to assess overbought or oversold conditions. However, the negative MACD value of -50.86 indicates that bearish momentum is currently stronger than bullish, with no immediate signs of a reversal. The MACD signal line’s absence further complicates this picture, as we lack a key reference point to anticipate crossovers. Traders should remain cautious, as the lack of strong momentum could indicate a period of consolidation before a clearer directional move.\n\nKey support for Ethereum is found around the 2790 level, with the price having recently touched this low and managed to stabilize. If it falls below this point, the next strong support zone could be around 2750, a level to watch closely for further downside risk. On the resistance side, the SMA at 2904 could act as a near-term hurdle. A breakout above this level would signal a potential shift toward a more neutral or bullish outlook, but it would need confirmation from additional indicators.\n\nGiven the current market structure, traders should be cautious about initiating long positions unless Ethereum convincingly breaks above the 2900-2910 zone. A quick pullback to the support level near 2790 presents a potential short opportunity if the broader bearish trend persists. Tight risk management is essential due to the choppy market behavior and the lack of a clear momentum shift."

      "content": "目前瑞波币/美元价格维持在1.78796附近，24小时内小幅下跌0.09%，市场处于震荡整理阶段。从短期走势来看，价格在1.78646与1.79509区间内波动，未能突破重要阻力位1.85200，表明市场情绪较为谨慎，投资者观望情绪较浓。\n\n从技术指标来看，MACD指标目前显示负值，且信号线尚未明确形成，暗示短期内市场可能处于下行压力中。然而，RSI指标尚未提供明确参考，缺乏强烈的超买或超卖信号，市场情绪保持中性。\n\n在支撑方面，1.78646是当前的短期支撑位，一旦跌破该价位，可能会进一步回落至1.78甚至更低。阻力位则位于1.79509，突破此水平后，价格可能再次尝试向SMA(20)的1.85200靠近，进一步上行的可能性较小。\n\n综合来看，瑞波币/美元短期内仍然维持震荡整理格局，建议投资者在当前区间内进行波段操作，耐心等待价格突破支撑或阻力位再作进一步决策。避免盲目追涨杀跌，保持适度的仓位管理。"

Despite only a small 24‑hour change, the inability to reclaim the SMA indicates sellers have a slight edge and the broader trend remains under distribution pressure. This aligns with neutral to bearish technical ratings seen across multiple oscillators in recent updates. \n\nYour MACD reading atalysis — Daily Updates｜Bitget](https://www.bitget.com/price/ripple/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *bitget.com*\n> Check our updated for XRP(XRP) Technical Analysis including real time updates with various oscillators, moving averages and other technical indicators on Bitget.\n\n\nYour MACD reading at **‑0.029** implies weakening momentum without a confirmed bullish signal, especially with no positive crossover yet. In isolation, MACD below zero often reflects that bearish momentum could persist until a bullish divergence or a move back above its signal line occurs.issing RSI value complicates the momentum picture, though external data suggests XRP’s RSI has hovered in neutral to mild sell zones, reinforcing caution. \n\n**Key support sits near the low — around ~$1.78**, with additional psychological support near **$1.70** and the range floor.

On the upside, **resistance aligns near the SMA (~1.85)** and higher around **$2.00–$2.10**, historically tested regions where upside attempts have stalled. A sustained break below near‑term support could open deeper pullbacks, while reclaiming the SMA with conviction may shift the short‑term trend toward range expansion. \n\nFor traders, a **neutral‑to for XRP - Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5EXRPUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *barchart.com* · 2025/11/4\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for XRP - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators.\n\n\nFor traders, a **neutral‑to‑defensive approach** makes sense in this backdrop. Consider **scalped longs near solid support with tight stops**, and **target rebounds toward the SMA or $2.00** for shorter‑term gains. More aggressive positions might await a confirmed break above the SMA with rising volume, indicating a shift in control to bulls. Conversely, stops under $1.75 could help manage risk if bearish momentum accelerates."

Provide technical analysis for Solana vs US Dollar (SOL/USD).\\n\\nCurrent Market Data:\\n- Latest Price: 84.29\\n- 24h Change: -0.51%\\n- High/Low: 84.98 / 84.23\\n- RSI(14): N/A\\n- MACD: -0.15309055, Signal: N/A\\n- SMA(20): 86.22050\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1. Write 3-4 paragraphs, 60-80 words each, total 250-300 words\\n2. Include: trend analysis, indicator interpretation, support/resistance levels, trading suggestions\\n3. Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s recent price action around **$84.29** shows a market in a **mild retracement after an attempt to reclaim higher levels**. The 24‑hour price range between **$84.23 and $84.98** suggests **reduced volatility**, with buyers and sellers in a temporary equilibrium. From a broader perspective, the short‑term structure still hints at **a correction within a larger uptrend**, as recent higher lows remain intact. However, the inability to sustain above the **20‑period SMA (~$86.22)** suggests near‑term bullish momentum is weakening.\n\nLooking at momentum, the **MACD reading of -0.153** indicates that the recent bullish impulse has lost steam and **bearish pressure is creeping in**. Without a signal line or RSI for context, we focus on available cues: **the negative MACD suggests sellers are slightly stronger** than buyers over recent periods. Should this trend continue, it may signal broader consolidation or even a deeper pullback before a fresh leg higher. Conversely, a rising MACD histogram on the next few sessions could mark a **renewed bullish shift**.\n\nIn terms of levels, **near‑term support sits around $82.50–$83.00**, where previous consolidation and order flow clustered. A break below this zone could see test of **$80.00**, a psychological and technical line from prior ranges. On the upside, **$86.50–$87.50** is a key resistance area, defined by the 20‑SMA and recent highs. A decisive break above this band with volume would improve the odds for a move toward **$90.00–$92.00**.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑responsive strategy** near current levels may work best: consider **scalp or swing long entries near support** with tight stops, and **scale into short positions on rejection near $86.50–$87.50** if momentum stalls. Risk‑averse traders might wait for **clear MACD cross or a reclaim of the 20‑SMA** before committing to directional positions. Always weigh broader market sentiment and news catalysts alongside technical clues."

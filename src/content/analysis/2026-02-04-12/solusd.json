Price action has been contained in a tight range between **$95.7 and $96.6**, suggesting short‑term consolidation rather than a clear breakout. The inability to hold above the 20‑period simple moving average (~**97.99**) indicates that bullish momentum is struggling to accelerate. Until SOL decisively moves above the 20‑SMA with volume confirmation, the trend remains **neutral to mildly bearish** on intraday time frames.\n\nLooking at momentum, the MACD at **–1.365** without a visible signal line reading implies that downside pressure has been present, even if recent price changes have been modest. The lack of an RSI reading limits clarity on overbought/oversold conditions, but historically, subdued momentum readings around key thresholds signal hesitation among buyers. The current setup suggests that momentum isn’t favoring a strong rally right now, and traders should watch for a MACD turn toward the signal line to confirm a shift in bias.\n\nKey support sits near **$94.50–$95.00**, drawn from recent low‑range reactions, with psychological backing at **$90.00** should that zone break. On the upside, immediate resistance aligns with the recent high around **$96.6**, followed by the 20‑SMA and then **$100.00** as a round‑number target. A close above $98 with volume could invite further upside toward $102–$105 zones, while failure to defend $95 may accelerate selling toward lower supports.\n\nFor trading, a cautious approach makes sense. Range‑bound traders might look to buy dips near support with tight stops below $94.5 and target the $96–$97 area. Breakout traders should wait for a confirmed close above the 20‑SMA before entering longs, targeting higher resistance levels. Conversely, a break below $95 could present short opportunities with disciplined risk management."

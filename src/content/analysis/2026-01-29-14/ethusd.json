      "content": "从价格结构看，ETH/USD 当前围绕2930一线窄幅波动，整体运行于20日均线下方，短线趋势偏弱。高低点区间收敛，显示多空力量暂时均衡，市场处于震荡整理阶段。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD数值为负且动能不足，反映下行压力仍未完全释放。RSI数据暂缺，但结合价格未能重回均线之上，判断买盘动能偏谨慎，反弹持续性有待观察。\n\n支撑位可关注2930附近的日内低点区域，若有效跌破，或下探2900整数关口。上方阻力首先在2970一线，对应20日均线位置，其次是3000心理关口，突破前难言转强。\n\n操作策略上，短线交易者宜保持轻仓思路，区间内高抛低吸为主。趋势型交易需等待价格重新站稳均线并配合指标转强，再考虑顺势做多，严格控制风险。"

The subdued 24-hour price action and failure to reclaim the SMA(20) suggest the trend is not convincingly bullish right now. A break above the SMA(20) could signal renewal of upward momentum, while rejection near current levels might extend the correction toward nearby support.** \n\n**Momentum indicators reinforce this cautious view. While MACD is in negative territory, indicating decelerating buying pressure, the absence of an RSI reading makes it harder to gauge overbought or oversold extremes. Typically, a negative MACD reflects that shorter-term momentum lags longer-term moving averages, a sign bears have the edge unless a crossover occurs.

Traders should watch for any MACD convergence or divergence as a potential early alert of a shift in control.** \n\n**Key levels to keep in mind: immediate support lies around **$2,900–$2,880**, a zone that has technically acted as a floor in recent sessions. A break below here could open the door toward the **$2,750–$2,720** range where buyers might re-emerge.

On the upside, a reclaim above **$3,000–$3,050** would be the first resistance hurdle, followed by the **$3,100–$3,120** area, which is a cluster of short-term technical resistance and pivot points. Breaking these could shift the narrative more bullish into the medium term.** turn0search12\n\n**For traders, short-term strategies might favor range-based plays: consider buying nearer support with tight stops if price tests sub-$2,900, targeting the $3,000 pivot on strength. Conversely, fading strength near key resistances offers potential short entries, especially if MACD stays bearish and fails to confirm upside. If price decisively clears $3,050 with good volume, look for a continuation toward higher resistance levels. Risk management should be emphasized given choppyngth.

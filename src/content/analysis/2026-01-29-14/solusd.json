      "content": "当前Solana/美元（SOL/USD）价格保持在122.8附近，24小时变化较小，仅为0.07%。价格在122.81和122.61之间震荡波动，显示出市场缺乏明显的上涨或下跌动力。整体来看，短期内市场趋势较为平淡，缺乏突破性的信号。\n\n技术指标方面，RSI(14)目前无法提供明确的超买或超卖信号。MACD处于负值区间（-0.80666694），这表明市场情绪偏向于看空，但由于Signal线尚未给出明确的反转信号，短期内可能会继续震荡。SMA(20)位于123.779附近，表示市场可能会在此水平附近遇到一定的阻力。\n\n在支撑与阻力方面，122.6附近可视为短期支撑位，若价格跌破该位置，可能会加速下行至122.0左右。而123.8附近则为阻力位，突破此位置可能会带动价格短期内向上反弹。投资者可以关注这些关键价位，适时调整操作策略。\n\n交易建议方面，由于市场趋势较为震荡，建议在支撑位附近考虑低位买入，在阻力位附近进行适当的卖出操作。同时，保持谨慎，避免追高操作，待市场出现更为明确的趋势时再做决策。"

After bouncing from key support near **$120** in recent sessions, the market has struggled to gather bullish momentum and remains below the 20‑day simple moving average (~123.78), implying short‑term pressure is outweighing buyer strength. A close above this SMA would be needed to shift the tone back toward bullish, whereas failure to defend **$120** could open the door to deeper retracements. \n> **[Solana Technical Analysis Report 28 January, 2026](https://financefeeds.com/solana-technical-analysis-report-28-january-2026/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *financefeeds.com* · 2026/1/28\n> Solana cryptocurrency can be expected to rise to the next resistance level 130.00, the breakout of which can lead to further gains toward the next resistance level 145.20 (which stopped previous waves iv and 1).\n\n\nLooking at momentum, the MACD is negative, reflecting bearish tilt, even as the signal line data isn’t available here; this typically suggests that downward momentum hasn’t yet flipped positive. Although the classic RSI reading isn’t provided, external analysis places Solana’s RSI around neutral to slightly bearish territory, which aligns with the sideways priceion and the lack of strong trend conviction. This kind of mixed indicator backdrop often results in range‑bound trading until a significant catalyst shifts sentiment. \n\nOn the charts, **support levels to watch** include **$120**, with additional layers around **$122.7–$124.0** pivot and standard deviation bands that could slow declines.22\n> 3. Bearish Technical Momentum (Bearish Impact) Overview: Solana’s price is caught between clear support near $120–$125 and resistance around $146–$150. Key momentum indicators are soft; the daily RSI is 43.8, and the price trades below its key 7-day and 30-day simple moving averages (around $134–$135).\n\n\nOn the charts, **support levels to watch** include **$120**, with additional layers around **$122.7–$124.0** pivot and standard deviation bands that could slow declines. Ahead of the market, **resistance clusters** around **$127–$130** mark the first hurdle, with a breakout above **$130–$135** likely needed to re‑engage buyers more confidently.

Price remains above the **20‑period SMA (~$85.83)**, suggesting the short‑term trend has *not fully flipped bearish*, but the negative 24‑hour change (-0.55%) hints at cautious pressure. Broader trend strength still looks mixed given limited directional momentum and modest upside follow‑through in recent sessions. \n\nThe **MACD value (0.0839)** sitting without a confirmed signal line crossover indicates *neutral to slightly bullish momentum*, but without a clear signal from the MACD histogram or RSI data it’s hard to conclude strong trend conviction right now. Traditionally, **RSI below 30 signals oversold and above 70 signals overbought**, but missing current RSI makes this unclear; some broader market sources show SOL oscillators leaning neutral to slightly bearish in longer timeframes. \n\nOn the chart, **support levels** around **$85–$86** (near short‑term moving averages) and deeper support near **$81–$82** are important zones bulls will want\n> Technical analysis for Solana SOL including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nOn the chart, **support levels** around **$85–$86** (near short‑term moving averages) and deeper support near **$81–$82** are important zones bulls will want to defend. Immediate **resistance** sits near the upper $88–$89 band, with next barriers toward **$94–$96**, aligning with recent pause zones. If buyers can reclaim and hold above **$88–$89**, this could set up a test of the next resistance cluster. Failing which, a deeper retracement toward the lowerport cluster may unfold. \n\nFor traders, a cautious approach is advisable: define risk near the **$84–$85** support zone and consider **long exposure only if price convincingly breaks and holds above $89** with volume confirmation. On the downside, short‑term traders might look for quick bounces at support for scalps, while longer positions ideally awaitdvisable: define risk near the **$84–$85** support zone and consider **long exposure only if price convincingly breaks and holds above $89** with volume confirmation.

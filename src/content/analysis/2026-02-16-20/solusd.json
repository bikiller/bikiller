Most broader technical summaries point to a *bearish overall trend* on daily timeframes, with recent price action tracing lower highs from the multi‑month downtrend that began after highs well above current levels. \n\nThe MACD reading at **-0.548** and a lack of signal line data still insinuates *bearish momentum*, even if the oscillator isn’t showing extreme divergence yet.

Traditional RSI readings from external sources tended to hover in or near oversold/neutral territory around **30–40**, which typically signals weak bullish conviction but potential for a swing if buying pressure increases — remember that oversold RSI can hint at a bounce rather than confirm a reversal. \n\nLooking at **support and resistance**, a near‑term support zone is around **$80–$82**, coinciding with recent lows and psychological thresholds where dip buyers have historically stepped in. Should that break decisively, next support might cluster neardips near $83 as oversold conditions appear, with $75 support critical for potential stabilization and market recovery.\n\n\nLooking at **support and resistance**, a near‑term support zone is around **$80–$82**, coinciding with recent lows and psychological thresholds where dip buyers have historically stepped in. Should that break decisively, next support might cluster near **$75**. Immediate resistance lies around **$87–$88**, a level that has capped upside attempts in recent sessions and would need to be reclaimed for traders to see short‑term bullish setups. \n\nFor trading suggestions, if you’re *risk seeking*, buying small near **support**com/crypto/quotes/%5ESOLUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *barchart.com* · 2026/1/25\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Solana - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators.\n\n\nFor trading suggestions, if you’re *risk seeking*, buying small near **support** with tight stops below $80 could work in a mean‑reversion setup, especially if momentum indicators improve. Conversely, breakouts *above resistance* near $88 with volume could target a retracement toward higher SMA zones. On the downside, failing to defend support invites continuation of the broader downtrend, so consider scaling out or hedging if declines breach key levels — this keeps risk managed in a choppy market."

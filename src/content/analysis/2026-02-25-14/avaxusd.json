Still, broader trend structures on daily and weekly charts reflect a lingering **bearish macro bias**, with prior descending channels keeping upside constrained. Until price decisively breaks above nearby zig‑zag resistances, the trend remains cautious rather than strongly directional. \n\nIndicator readings paint a **mixed picture**. Your fresh MACD reading at **0.2226** suggests developing positive momentum, though the absence of a confirmed signal line data limits full interpretation. In context, external sources point to generally neutral-to-bearish MACD and low RSI readings around oversold levels near + channel resistance, consistent with a Wave B in an ABC correction.

In context, external sources point to generally neutral-to-bearish MACD and low RSI readings around oversold levels near ~32–36, indicating **momentum may be stabilizing but isn’t strongly bullish** yet. The SMA(20) acting as current dynamic support shows some underlying strength, but broader moving averages still weigh on the upside. \n\nKey **support and resistance zones** cluster around the lower $9.30–$9.00 area and a more significant pivot near **$8.80–tgpt.com)** · *coinlore.com* · 2026/2/25\n> Technical analysis for Avalanche AVAX including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nKey **support and resistance zones** cluster around the lower $9.30–$9.00 area and a more significant pivot near **$8.80–$8.50**, below which a deeper pullback toward the $7.60–$7.00 range could unfold if sellers accelerate. On the upside, immediate resistance is around **$9.90–$10.00**, followed by more meaningful layers near **$11.00–$12.00** where previous highs and longer moving averages reside.

Breaks above **$10.00** with volume could open momentum trades toward higher resistance, but confirmation from RSI climbing above 50 and a bullish MACD crossover would strengthen conviction. Conversely, if price fails to hold current supports, reducing exposure or employing defensive hedges until trend clarity improves would be prudent. \n> **[Avalanche (AVAX) Momentum Evaluation: RSI and MACD Convergence for ...](https://www.ainvest.com/news/avalanche-avax-momentum-evaluation-rsi-macd-convergence-entry-timing-2601/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *ainvest.com* · 2026/1/22\n> The convergence of RSI and MACD indicators paints a compelling case for AVAX's near-term recovery. The RSI's neutral stance and the MACD's mixed signals collectively suggest a scenario where AVAX could break above critical resistance levels, such as $12.78, to target $13.22 within 2-4 weeks."

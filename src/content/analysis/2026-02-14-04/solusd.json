Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action around **$84.8** shows that the market is in a **mild consolidation phase** after a recent up move. The narrow high/low range (85.02 / 84.8) suggests **low volatility**, likely indicating indecision between buyers and sellers. While we don’t have the full RSI value, the price sitting close to the **20‑period SMA at 83.316** implies prices are **hovering near short‑term average levels**, which often precedes a breakout or pullback depending on incoming volume.\n\nThe **MACD reading of 1.33853**, without a visible signal line, still suggests that **momentum has been positive recently**, although the lack of a complete signal line makes it hard to confirm a fresh bullish crossover. If the MACD stays above its signal once available, that would support continued upward momentum. Conversely, weakening MACD momentum alongside sideways price action could warn of a **loss of bullish conviction**. Keep an eye on whether price maintains above the 20‑SMA, which currently acts as a dynamic pivot.\n\nKey **support levels** to watch are near **$83.3 (20‑SMA)** and psychological support around **$80**, which historically holds in corrective phases. On the upside, immediate **resistance** is around **$86–$87**, where recent highs clustered. A break above this zone with increased volume could open the path toward **$90 in the near term**. If support breaks below the 20‑SMA decisively, the next meaningful confluence sits near **$78–$80**.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑bound approach** makes sense in the current environment. Consider **long entries** above confirmed breaks of resistance with solid volume and **tight stops** just below the breakout zone. For more conservative strategies, waiting for a retest of support near the 20‑SMA before entering longs can reduce risk. If bearish signals strengthen (e.g., MACD crossover down), short‑term **pullbacks or profit‑taking** could be suitable near resistance levels."

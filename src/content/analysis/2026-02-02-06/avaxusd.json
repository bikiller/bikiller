This suggests recent momentum has softened and overhead pressure persists. The lack of an RSI here likely points to a muted momentum signal, but the negative MACD reading (‑0.1019) implies that downside momentum still slightly outweighs buying strength. In this context, expect the near‑term trend to struggle to sustain breakouts unless buyers step in decisively.\n\nWhen we look at **support and resistance**, the current level around **$9.58** represents immediate intraday support from the recent swing low. If this zone breaks with volume, bears may target lower psychological levels around the next established support bands seen in broader historical data (e.g., sub‑$9 and then mid‑single digits). On the upside, dynamic resistance sits near your SMA(20) and then higher at areas where liquidity clusters have formed in the past, often near **prior declining pivot zones** above $10–$11. A clean close above $10.20–$10.50 on higher volume would signal tentative relief.\n\nIndicator interpretation reinforces caution. The **MACD staying negative** without a signal line crossover suggests momentum isn’t reversing yet. Traders usually need to see the MACD histogram turn positive *and* price clear the moving average to consider a trend shift. While some broader analyses might show RSI lingering in neutral territory rather than oversold, that alone doesn’t confirm upside without accompanying strength in price or volume, especially given prevailing bearish technical weightings across standard MAs and oscillators in external scans. \n\nFor **trading suggestions**, a conservative approach could involve waiting for confirmation: long entries only if price sustainably breaks above the 20‑day SMA with supportive MACD/RSI signals, and ideally volume expansion. Shorter‑term traders might considerals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, a conservative approach could involve waiting for confirmation: long entries only if price sustainably breaks above the 20‑day SMA with supportive MACD/RSI signals, and ideally volume expansion. Shorter‑term traders might consider range plays, buying close to immediate support with tight stops under $9.50 and targeting the SMA zone. Risk management is key — if support gives way, protective stops can prevent deeper losses. Longer‑term positions should view current structure as corrective within a broader downtrend until a structural reversal appears, keeping exposure scaled appropriately to volatility."

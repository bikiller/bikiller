Provide technical analysis for Avalanche vs US Dollar (AVAX/USD).\\n\\nCurrent Market Data:\\n- Latest Price: 8.9913\\n- 24h Change: -0.01%\\n- High/Low: 9.0085 / 8.9799\\n- RSI(14): N/A\\n- MACD: -0.037123797, Signal: N/A\\n- SMA(20): 9.09881\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1.

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s recent price action around **$8.99** reflects a market that’s currently **range‑bound** with slight bearish bias. After failing to sustain above the short‑term SMA(20) at **~$9.10**, sellers have kept upside attempts in check. The narrow 24‑hour high/low band (**9.0085 / 8.9799**) suggests reduced volatility, often a precursor to a breakout. For now, the trend lacks decisive directional conviction, with short‑term movement confined to familiar support and resistance thresholds.\n\nLooking at momentum, the **MACD’s negative reading (-0.037)** implies downward pressure, even without a clear signal line to confirm divergence. That said, the absence of a quoted RSI(14) hampers visibility into overbought or oversold conditions. Still, the price sitting below the SMA(20) tilts the bias mildly bearish in the short term. Should the MACD sustain its negative slope while the price remains under moving average resistance, sellers could retain the upper hand.\n\nKey technical levels to watch include **support near $8.80–8.85**, a zone where buyers previously stepped in, and **resistance at $9.10–9.15**, which has capped rallies. A decisive break above **$9.15** on strong volume could shift sentiment toward recovery, paving the way for a retest of **$9.40–9.50**. Conversely, a break beneath **$8.80** might expose lower levels like **$8.50–8.60**, inviting deeper profit taking or stop‑loss sweeps.\n\nIn terms of strategy, traders might consider a **range‑trading approach** while price remains compressed: buying near support with tight risk controls and taking partial profits near resistance. If breakout momentum emerges, switching to **trend‑following entries** on retests of broken levels could capture more directional moves. Always weigh your entries against risk tolerance, and watch volume as a confirmation tool for any breakout attempt."

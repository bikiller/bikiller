      "content": "当前Solana（SOL）价格在104.85美元附近，整体表现趋于震荡。24小时内下跌0.68%，市场没有明显的趋势性变化。考虑到该币种接近前期高点105.68美元，但未能突破，短期内可能维持横盘整理走势。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD值为-3.34470，显示出一定的卖压，但由于信号线数据缺失，难以对短期方向做出精准判断。SMA(20)位于109.19850，表明当前价格低于短期移动平均线，可能会面临短期的下行压力。RSI(14)数据缺失，无法通过超买或超卖信号进一步确认市场情绪。\n\n在支撑方面，104.1美元是较为关键的支撑位，一旦跌破可能会加剧下行趋势。阻力位则位于105.68美元及其上方，突破该区间可能开启更高的价格水平。市场目前处于整理状态，缺乏明确的突破信号。\n\n交易建议上，建议投资者采取观望策略，等待突破或调整后的买入信号。如果价格跌破支撑位，可考虑做空；而突破105.68美元后，则可以关注短期的多头机会。"

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s short‑term trend shows **mild bearish pressure** as the price trades below the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA). With the latest price at **104.85** and a 24‑hour decline, the market lacks upward momentum. The recent range between **105.68 (intraday high)** and **104.10 (low)** suggests consolidation after a pullback. Unless buyers reclaim the SMA zone near **109.20**, the near‑term path favors choppy, sideways moves with a slight downside bias.\n\nThe limited indicator readings point to waning bullish strength. A negative MACD value around **–3.34** suggests that momentum has tilted toward sellers, even though a corresponding signal line is unavailable for a crossover read. Without a valid RSI input, conviction on oversold conditions is incomplete. Still, the divergence between price and the moving average implies weakening upward conviction. Traders should watch for a MACD uptick toward zero to signal possible momentum recovery.\n\nKey **support levels** sit near **102.50** and **100.00**, where past order flow has shown interest and psychological buying may emerge. A break below these zones could open the door to deeper corrections. On the upside, immediate **resistance** remains at **105.68** and tougher hurdles cluster around the SMA at **109.20–110.00**. Clearing that area with volume would mark a shift toward renewed bullish engagement and re‑establish the short‑term uptrend.\n\nFor trading suggestions, consider a **range‑based approach** while price stays confined below the SMA. Short‑term sellers may target rebounds toward **105.50–106.00** with tight risk control. Conversely, buyers might look for confirmed support at **102.50** or a break above **109.20** with sustained volume before entering long positions. Always use appropriate risk management, with stops tailored to your timeframe and volatility expectations."

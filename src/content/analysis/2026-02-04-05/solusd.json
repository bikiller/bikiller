This modest drift under the SMA suggests that **short‑term momentum remains weak** and that the broader trend lacks firm bullish conviction. Without new strength above this average, price could drift sideways or test lower zones before meaningful directional conviction returns. Historical pivot studies also indicate nearby resistance just above $100–$103 and initial support around **$94–$92** with stronger floors near **$86–$87** if sellers intensify pressure. \n\nIndicator signals lean toward **consolidation and caution**. Your current MACD reading of –1.30513 with no signal line data available implies momentum on the bearish side of neutral; in full indicator contexts this often aligns with weakening upward pressure rather than full sell‑off conviction. Other sources reportution**. Your current MACD reading of –1.30513 with no signal line data available implies momentum on the bearish side of neutral; in full indicator contexts this often aligns with weakening upward pressure rather than full sell‑off conviction. Other sources report MACD and RSI (where available) below neutral levels, suggesting momentum isn’t building aggressively in either direction. RSI readings in broader data sets often hover in mid‑range or slightly bearish readings, reinforcing the picture of *lackluster trend strength*. Typical interpretations of MACD and RSI confirm momentum is subdued, not strongly trending. *[Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis - CoinLore](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/solana/technical-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *coinlore.com* · 2026/2/1\n> Technical analysis for Solana SOL including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nIn terms of **support/resistance levels**, the psychological $100 mark is the immediate resistance zone, reinforced by the aforementioned SMA(20). If bulls push above $101–$103, next resistance could cluster near $107–$110. On the downside, a break below $94–$92 may open deeper retracements toward $86–$87 — levels that previously acted as longer‑term support in technical profiles. These pivot boundaries can be useful for gau risk and planning entry/exit zones if price volatility expands again. \n\nFrom a **trading suggestion** standpoint, the setup leans toward **range‑responsive strategies** rather than breakout chasing. Short‑term traders might consider scaling into long positions near lower support ($92–$94) with tight stops to limit drawdowns, targeting initial resistance near $100–$103. Conversely, breakdown trades under $92 could be probed with stops above recent local highs. Given the neutral momentum, it’s sensible to wait for clearer confirmation — such as a sustained move above the SMA or a MACD crossover — before committing larger positionnversely, breakdown trades under $92 could be probed with stops above recent local highs. Given the neutral momentum, it’s sensible to wait for clearer confirmation — such as a sustained move above the SMA or a MACD crossover — before committing larger position sizes. Always weigh risk tolerance and stay attuned to shifts in market breadth and volume that could redefine the near‑term trend."

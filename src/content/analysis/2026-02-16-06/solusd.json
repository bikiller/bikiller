      "content": "当前Solana/美元（SOL/USD）的价格表现呈现出震荡整理的局面。最新价格为84.76美元，24小时内波动较小，仅为0.13%。价格未能突破前期的86.25美元区域，也未跌破84.62美元的低点，显示市场短期内缺乏明确的方向。\n\n在技术指标方面，MACD指标为负值（-0.6711），表明市场目前处于弱势，但由于缺乏信号线的支持，难以判断趋势的强度。RSI（14）暂未给出明确值，但如果价格继续维持当前区间，RSI可能会提供超卖或超买的信号，进一步指导市场情绪。\n\n支撑位方面，84.62美元是关键支撑，一旦跌破该水平，可能会加剧下行压力，目标位可以看至82美元附近。阻力位在86.25美元，若突破该价位，则可能开启新的上行空间，进一步挑战90美元关口。\n\n交易建议方面，建议投资者保持观望，等待价格突破区间后再做决策。如果价格突破上方阻力86.25美元，可考虑顺势做多；若跌破下方支撑84.62美元，则可考虑做空。"

After failing to sustain above local highs near the mid‑$80s, the momentum appears subdued. Broader market sentiment and on‑chain behavior suggest confidence is limited, keeping the trend in a **neutral to modestly bearish phase** until a meaningful breakout above resistance or breakdown below key support occurs. \n\nLookingana New Holders Drop by 2.3 Million, Will It Impact Price Recovery?](https://beincrypto.com/solana-new-holders-sell-sol-price-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *beincrypto.com* · 2026/2/15\n> Solana new addresses drop 2.3 million as $117 million SOL moves to exchanges, keeping price trapped between $78 and $89.\n\n\nLooking at indicator dynamics, the MACD being negative signals that **bearish momentum still has influence** and suggests caution on long entries.

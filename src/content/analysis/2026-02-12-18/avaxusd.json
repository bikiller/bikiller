Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is showing **modest consolidation** after a recent attempt to break higher. With the latest price at **$8.7133** and 24‑hour movement limited to **+0.42%**, momentum has been subdued. The market has been oscillating within a narrow band, reflected in a slight failure to meaningfully exceed the previous high near **$8.726**. This suggests a **neutral to mildly bearish trend** in the short term, as price is below the 20‑period SMA and lacks strong directional conviction.\n\nThe fact that the **SMA(20) at $8.792** remains above the current price underlines short‑term weakness. Typically, price below a short‑period SMA points to sellers having control, at least marginally. Without the RSI value available, it’s harder to quantify overbought/oversold conditions, but the muted range and failure to sustain above moving average point to **limited bullish momentum**. The MACD reading of **0.0117** (with signal not available) implies a slight positive in underlying momentum, but without confirmation from the signal line, this is **not a strong buy signal**.\n\nImmediate **support** appears around **$8.67–8.70**, where recent price action found buying interest; a breakdown below this range could open the door to lower levels near **$8.50**. On the upside, **resistance** is near the 20‑period SMA around **$8.79–8.80** and extends toward **$8.90**, where previous swing highs were capped. A decisive break above these resistance levels, with increased volume, would be needed to shift the narrative toward renewed upside potential.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑bound strategy** may be appropriate in the absence of clear trend signals: consider **long exposure near support** with tight stops just below, and **short rallies into resistance**, especially if price continues to reject the SMA. Risk‑averse participants might wait for a clean break and retest of the **$8.80 level** before initiating directional positions."

The recent price action slightly below the 20‑period Simple Moving Average (~81.20) suggests the short‑term trend is still bearish‑leaning, with sellers in control unless a decisive push above that average occurs. A sustained break below the recent intraday low (~78.59) could confirm continuation of this downtrend, while reclaiming and holding above $81–$82 may hint at trend stabilization.  \n\nLooking at **indicator interpretation**, the MACD reading at –1.64828 highlights persistent downside momentum, even though the signal line is unavailable for full crossover context. This negative MACD points to selling pressure outweighing buying interest, complementing price action that trades below the mid‑band moving average. Traders would normally watch RSI(14) for oversold conditions, but with that data not provided, the focus shifts to price levels and momentum lines to gauge strength. In this frame, weaker indicators support a cautious stance.  \n\nOn **support and resistance levels**, immediate support sits right around the current lows — a break under ~$78 makes the next psychological floor near ~$70–$73 important, as this area has previously acted as a defensive zone in broader cycles. On the upside, resistance begins near the 20 SMA (~$81) and extends toward the ~$85–$88 cluster where selling pressure historically intensifies before larger advances can form. Clearing above ~91 would add confidence for a move toward higher targets.  \n\nFor **trading suggestions**, short‑term traders might prefer range‑defined tactics: defend exposed longs with tight stops under $78 while considering entries on clear reclaims of $81+ with volume confirmation.bullish pattern, but drop in holder accumulation and rising leverage warn of a bull trap.\n  \n\nFor **trading suggestions**, short‑term traders might prefer range‑defined tactics: defend exposed longs with tight stops under $78 while considering entries on clear reclaims of $81+ with volume confirmation. Conversely, aggressive short setups could aim for breakdowns under current support, with targets toward $70. Intermediate traders may wait for a convincing break of the key resistance zone around $85–$88 before committing to bullish positions, as this wouldnal potential reversal of the recent downtrend."

The latest price at **12.0698** suggests the market is holding above short-term averages, with the **20‑period SMA at 11.777** acting as a near‑term dynamic support. Bulls have managed to keep the price above this average, indicating that the short‑term trend is still slightly positive despite the modest pullback seen over the last 24 hours. Keep an eye on whether this support holds, as a clean break below could invite more selling pressure.\n\nLooking at momentum, the **MACD reading of 0.0587** suggests there is still some bullish sentiment lingering, even if the lack of a corresponding signal line makes the crossover context unclear. Without a valid RSI(14) value, we lean on price behavior and moving average positioning to gauge strength. The steady SMA level and tight price range between the recent **high of 12.1201 and low of 12.0532** point toward an indecisive market, where neither buyers nor sellers have asserted clear control. This type of sideways movement often precedes a sharper directional move.\n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, the obvious near‑term support sits around **$11.75–11.80**, tied to the 20 SMA and recent price reactions. A break under this band would open the way toward **$11.50** and lower. On the upside, the **$12.12** zone is the immediate resistance to watch; surpassing it convincingly could lead to a challenge of **$12.40–12.50** levels where selling interest has shown up previously. These levels are important for structuring risk and potential entry points.\n\nFor traders considering positions, a conservative approach would be to wait for clarity—specifically, a breakout above the recent high or a breakdown below the short‑term support. Swing traders might favor long entries near support with tight stops, while scalpers could trade the defined range. Always pair technical levels with volume and broader market sentiment before committing capital."

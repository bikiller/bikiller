The price holding above the 20‑period simple moving average around 890 suggests short‑term momentum remains tilted upward. The latest price action, with a mild 0.68% gain and a relatively narrow high/low range, indicates buyers are defending higher levels without excessive volatility. This sets the stage for a trend that could steadily grind higher if macro sentiment remains supportive.\n\nWithout a complete RSI and MACD signal line, we lean on available momentum data. The **MACD reading at 1.50597** still implies positive momentum, though the absence of a signal line makes precise crossover interpretation impossible. Price above the SMA(20) confirms that recent momentum favors the bulls. Once the full RSI data returns, watch for readings above 50 to validate strength. For now, the trend suggests measured but intact upside bias rather than aggressive extension.\n\nNear‑term **support** sits just below at the 890 level, with a stronger cushion around 875–880 where prior consolidation formed. Should price dip toward those zones on lighter volume, it could provide low‑risk entries for long positions. Immediate **resistance** is clustered near recent highs around 905–910, and a break above this zone with conviction could open the path toward 925–935. Conversely, a decisive failure below the SMA zone risks deeper pullbacks into the 860–870 area.\n\nTrading suggestions focus on disciplined entries and risk management. Consider partial long exposure on dips toward the 890–880 support, with stops under 870 to protect against trend shifts. If price pushes above 910 with strong volume, adding to longs with tight scaling could work. Short positions aren’t advisable unless support breaks strongly, signaling a trend reversal. Keep position sizing conservative given the incomplete indicator set and current consolidation dynamics."

Given the slightly negative 24‑hour change and the MACD reading below zero, selling pressure remains present. A break below recent lows could accelerate downside momentum, especially as broader crypto markets have shown risk‑off sentiment lately. You’re seeing lower highs and struggle to move above short moving averages, reinforcing this bearish bias.\n\nWithout a provided RSI, the MACD below zero hints at **bearish momentum** that hasn’t yet triggered a clear reversal. Traditionally, below‑zero MACD suggests the short‑term EMA is below longer‑term EMA, meaning sellers are dominating currently, and oscillators are likely oversold but not signaling a strong bounce yet. Price under the SMA(20) generally confirms the short‑term bias remains weak. Until momentum indicators converge bullishly, expect resistance to hold near the SMA and recent highs.\n\nFor **support and resistance**, key technical levels near the current price are clustered. Immediate support sits around ~$95–96, close to recent lows on intraday charts; a break below here could open up further downside towards $90–92. Resistance begins near the current SMA level (~99–100), with additional upside barriers at higher psychological round numbers. A decisive break above 100 with volume could flip bias into short‑term bullish territory, inviting buyers.\n\nTrading suggestions in this environment lean **neutral to cautious**. If you’re positioned short‑term, consider scaling into long only on sustained closes above the SMA(20) and look for confirmation from momentum indicators turning positive. On the downside, define risk clearly and watch for support breaks before initiating fresh short exposure. For swing traders, waiting for MACD cross back toward positive territory or a breakout above key resistance might offer a cleaner entry signal. \n> **[Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis - Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/solana/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed SOL forecast as well as a Solana technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators."

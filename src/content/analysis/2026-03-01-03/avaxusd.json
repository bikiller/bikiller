While the broader trend still respects a series of higher lows from prior cycles, the inability to hold above $9.30 suggests sellers are active. A break and close below the $9.00–$8.90 zone could signal deeper correction risks toward the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA) around **$8.87**, which currently acts as the first meaningful dynamic support on shorter timeframes.\n\nOn the indicators, MACD’s positive reading at ~0.115 indicates that underlying momentum still leans toward the upside, even if some cooling has occurred in the past 24 hours. The absence of a corresponding signal line value limits definitive crossover interpretation, but the positive MACD suggests that if volatility returns, upside moves could accelerate. The currently unavailable RSI might otherwise help confirm oversold conditions, but keeping an eye on RSI dipping below 40 on a close below $9.00 could offer early evidence of broader weakening.\n\nKey **support levels** to watch are the 20‑SMA near **$8.87**, followed by the psychologically round $8.50 and the multi‑session low near $8.20. Resistance clusters sit around $9.30–$9.38, with a more pronounced barrier at $9.60 — a level that, if reclaimed convincingly, could reignite bullish interest. Volume patterns accompanying attempts above these resistance layers will be important; lackluster volume often precedes failure to maintain upside.\n\nFrom a trading perspective, short‑term traders might consider light long exposure on pullbacks near the $8.90–$9.00 support band, using tight risk management and stops below $8.80. Breakouts above $9.40–$9.50 with confirming volume could offer higher‑probability entries targeting $9.70–$10.00. Conversely, sustained weakness below $8.80 may invite bearish setups, favoring lower support tests before reassessing long bias."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAVAX is showing a modestly bullish bias as price hovers around **9.2763**, slightly above the **20‑period SMA at 9.1213**. This indicates short‑term strength has been maintained, with buyers defending support after a minor consolidation. The narrow daily range suggests indecision, but the fact that the price remains above the moving average reflects lower volatility and a potential ramp into a more pronounced uptrend if buying pressure increases.\n\nThe **MACD reading of 0.1154** (without a corresponding signal line) still suggests positive momentum, with the histogram likely above zero. Even without a computed signal line, this positive momentum aligns with the price staying above the SMA. In the absence of an RSI reading, we infer from price structure that the market isn’t overextended. Without clear overbought or oversold signals, risk management and observing how momentum evolves over the next sessions becomes crucial.\n\nKey support lies near **9.00**, reinforced by psychological round‑number support and the **20‑period SMA zone**, offering a cushion for pullbacks. A break below this level could expose **8.70–8.50** as a deeper support area where previous demand has clustered. On the upside, immediate resistance sits around **9.40–9.50**, with the next significant barrier near **9.80–10.00**. Clearing these levels with volume could pivot the trend into a more sustainable bullish phase.\n\nFor traders, the short bias might still be beaten back until price convincingly breaks above **9.50**. A conservative approach would be to **buy on dips** toward the **9.00–9.05** support band with tight stops beneath **8.90**, targeting moves toward **9.60–9.80**. Alternatively, **breakout entries above 9.50** with confirmation could favor momentum plays, always keeping discipline on stop levels and monitoring broader market cues that might rapidly shift AVAX volatility."

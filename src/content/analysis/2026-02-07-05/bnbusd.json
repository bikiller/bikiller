The pair has struggled to sustain gains above recent highs near ~$660–$670, indicating that buyers need firmer conviction to shift momentum back up. In the broader context, repeated attempts above these levels failing to hold could signal potential continuation of corrective action. \n\nLooking at the available indicators, MACD reading of **2.49** above zero implies that some upside energy remains, but without the signal line value we can’t confirm a fresh bullish crossover. The lack of a current RSI figure herelow this could lead to a downturn toward the $600 mark. 📈 Trend Analysis: BNB 's price is currently consolidating near the $640 zone, maintaining support at $625. The formation of a declining channel suggests that overcoming the $660 resistance is essential for bullish momentum.\n\n\nLooking at the available indicators, MACD reading of **2.49** above zero implies that some upside energy remains, but without the signal line value we can’t confirm a fresh bullish crossover. The lack of a current RSI figure here means we’d want to track whether momentum is weakening or staying balanced as price hovers near support. When combined with price being near the short‑term SMA, this suggests choppy conditions with no decisive trend yet. Historically, extended ranges have resolved in either direction depending on broader market catalysts. \n\nKey support levels to watch include the **$645 zone**,ypto Expert ...](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/20329609696498?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Binance* · 2025/2/15\n> $615: A critical backup support.

The formation of a declining channel suggests that overcoming the $660 resistance is essential for bullish momentum.\n\n\nKey support levels to watch include the **$645 zone**, with deeper support around **$625–$615** — a break below could invite stronger selling and expose lower bands around $600. On the upside, resistance resides near **$660–$670**, with a more significant barrier around **$685–$700** if bullish volume returns. A sustained break above these thresholds would shift the near‑term structure to neutral or bullish. Conversely, failure to reclaim meaningful upside levels likely keeps BNB range‑bound or trending lower. \n\nFor traders, maintaining disciplined entries and exits is important.

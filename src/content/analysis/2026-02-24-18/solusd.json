This suggests a tentative equilibrium between buyers and sellers, albeit with slightly bearish bias given the small negative 24‑hour change. In this environment, trend analysis points to a subdued or sideways drift — lacking a clear, strong directional impulse — as the market digests recent volatility and upcoming catalysts.\n\nIndicator interpretation reinforces the cautious tone. With **MACD below zero (~–0.398)**, momentum is tilting bearish, hinting at persistent selling pressure. Although we don’t have an explicit RSI figure here, broader technical sources show the pair often hovering in neutral to slightly oversold zones nearby, implying limited upward firepower before corrective bounces occur. The 20‑period SMA acting as dynamic support suggests bulls are defending this zone for now, but without confirmation from other momentum metrics, conviction remains low. \n\nFrom a support/resistance standpoint, immediate technical support lies near the **$75 mark**, which has been highlighted as a critical floor where buyers have recently stepped in to absorb selling interest; a breakdown here could expose deeper levels near **$66 to $59** in a swift corrective move.

On the upside, near‑term resistance begins around **$88–90**, representing the first hurdle for sustaining upward momentum. Beyond that, broader structural resistance in the mid‑$90s to $100+ area could act as significant supply zones before trend reversal confirmation. search6\n\nTrading suggestions in this context lean toward disciplined, range‑aware approaches. Aggressive traders might look to add on intraday dips toward support while setting tight stops below $75 to manage risk. More conservative participants could wait for a breakout above $88 with volume confirmation before scaling long positions, as this would indicate a potential shift away from the current consolidation regime.

Until such a breakout occurs, expect choppy price action with heightened sensitivity at defined technical thresholds."

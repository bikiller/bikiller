      "title": "雪崩币/美元技术分析：震荡整理，短期偏弱",
      "content": "当前雪崩币（AVAX）/美元价格在12.11附近震荡整理，显示出短期内缺乏明确的趋势。24小时变化幅度较小，表明市场暂时处于观望状态。价格目前位于短期均线SMA(20)附近，表明可能存在小范围的调整。\n\n从技术指标来看，MACD处于负值区间，且无明显的信号线交叉，暗示短期卖压仍然较重，市场情绪偏空。RSI未提供，无法进一步分析超买超卖的情况，因此只能依据现有价格水平推测，短期内可能继续维持震荡走势。\n\n在支撑和阻力方面，当前价格下方的支撑位大致在12.10附近，而上方阻力则在12.14左右。若价格突破12.14，可能会迎来一波反弹，反之，则有可能进一步回测12.10附近的支撑区域。\n\n综合来看，当前AVAX/USD短期内可能继续在12.10至12.14区间内震荡整理。对于短线交易者，建议在12.10附近寻找支撑做多，而在接近12.14时考虑卖出。但考虑到市场整体情绪偏弱，谨慎操作为宜。"

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche is exhibiting a **modest bearish bias** around the current price of **$12.11**, with the latest session barely moving from the low and showing a slight negative 24‑hour change. Price has struggled to break above the **SMA(20) at $12.14**, suggesting short‑term sellers remain active just above current levels. This trend weakness is consistent with a market that lacks conviction, often seen after failed attempts to reclaim moving average momentum.\n\nAlthough RSI(14) isn’t available, the **MACD reading at -0.026** indicates that momentum is tilted to the downside, even without a corresponding signal line for confirmation. The persistent negative MACD suggests that bearish pressure could grow if buyers don’t step in soon. In this context, the inability to sustain above minor intraday peaks near **$12.13** reinforces the notion that the market is range‑bound and lacks a clear directional impulse.\n\nOn support and resistance, immediate **support sits near $12.00** — a psychological round number where bids have clustered previously. A breach below that zone could open the path toward **$11.80–$11.60**, levels that previously acted as consolidation zones. Conversely, a clean break above **$12.30–$12.40** would be notable, potentially inviting short‑covering and a move toward **$12.60** as the next logical resistance.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, traders might consider **range‑oriented strategies** in this environment, such as defined‑risk entries near support with tight stops below the psychological $12 mark. Breakout traders could wait for confirmation above the 20‑period moving average and a rising MACD histogram to favor longs. Risk management remains key given the muted volatility and lack of strong trend conviction."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAVAX/USD is currently exhibiting **a mild consolidation phase** around the $8.80 area after recent sideways trading. Price action shows limited directional momentum as the pair hovers just below the 20‑period simple moving average at **$8.843**, which is acting as a short‑term resistance. The narrow range between the daily high and low reflects indecision among traders, with neither bulls nor bears asserting control. Until price convincingly breaks above the SMA(20) or below key support levels, the trend remains neutral to mildly bearish.\n\nAlthough RSI(14) and the MACD signal line are not available, the **MACD histogram reading of -0.0478** suggests that downside pressure still lingers, with momentum slightly favoring sellers. The absence of a confirmed MACD crossover limits clarity on trend shifts; however, the negative histogram indicates that bearish momentum has not fully dissipated. Traders should watch for a potential uptick in buying strength that could push the MACD toward a bullish cross, which would lend confidence to a reversal scenario.\n\nImmediate **support is likely around the recent low near $8.79**, with a deeper zone of interest around **$8.60–$8.50**, where buyers previously stepped in. A break below $8.50 could expose lower support near the $8.20–$8.00 region. On the upside, a sustained move above **$8.85–$8.90** could open the door to retesting the $9.10–$9.25 resistance cluster. A decisive break above that zone would shift the near‑term outlook toward renewed bullish interest.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑responsive approach** may be more suitable in the current environment. Consider long entries near established support with tight stops below breakdown levels, targeting short‑term resistance. Conversely, short positions could be explored if price fails to reclaim the 20 SMA and key resistance zones, with risk defined above recent swing highs. Always weigh broader market sentiment and volume to confirm setups."

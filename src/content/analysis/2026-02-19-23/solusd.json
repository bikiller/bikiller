Price action remains slightly above the **20‑period SMA (~$81.47)**, suggesting tentative bullish bias in the most recent sessions. The narrow 24‑hour range and minimal change (+0.06%) indicate indecision and low momentum, which often precedes a trend continuation or a sharper corrective move. Watching how price interacts with the SMA will be key for confirming near‑term bias.\n\nWith the **MACD below zero at -0.0777** and the signal line not yet available, momentum appears subdued. A negative MACD implies that bearish pressure still lingers, even though price is holding above the short‑term average. In the absence of a computed **RSI**, we can infer from tight range behavior that neither overbought nor oversold conditions dominate. This typically aligns with a neutral or transitioning market phase, where breakouts from consolidation often set the next directional impulse.\n\nImmediate **support** sits near the 20‑SMA and the lower bound of the recent range around **$82.20–$81.40**; a break below this zone could usher in deeper retracements toward the **$80** psychological level. On the upside, **resistance** is evident around **$83.00–$84.00**, with further barriers near **$85–$86** where previous swing highs clustered. Sustained moves above these levels would shift the medium‑term structure toward more bullish, whereas failure to hold support might re‑energize sellers.\n\nFor traders, a measured approach is prudent. A bullish scenario might involve entering long positions only after a clear close above **$84.00** with volume confirmation, targeting **$86–$88** while keeping stops below the recent support zone. Conversely, short‑term bearish setups could be considered on decisive breaks below **$81.40**, targeting **$80** and adjusting risk if price recovers above the 20‑SMA. Always weigh overall market liquidity and news catalysts when sizing positions."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s recent price action around **$87.67** reflects a short-term consolidation phase after a modest uptick. The pair has struggled to decisively break above the **SMA(20) at ~88.28**, indicating that bullish momentum has weakened slightly. While the 24-hour change is positive, the tight high/low range suggests a lack of conviction from buyers and sellers. Overall, the trend remains neutral to cautiously bullish as long as price holds above near-term support.\n\nWith incomplete RSI and MACD components, we lean on the available MACD histogram reading of **0.8867**, which hints that underlying momentum is still positive despite lacking a complete signal line comparison. The proximity of price to the 20-period SMA underscores a watchful bias; a sustained move above this average could catalyze renewed upside interest. Conversely, a rejection here may signal a deeper correction toward established support zones.\n\nKey **support levels** to monitor are near **$85.50**, followed by a more significant floor around **$83.00**, where prior demand has emerged. Should sellers intensify around current prices, these zones could provide tactical entry points for long positions. On the upside, immediate **resistance** aligns with the 20-period SMA, while a break above **$90.00** would open the door toward **$95.00**, a level that has historically capped rallies in recent sessions.\n\nFrom a tactical standpoint, consider scaling into longs on dips to support while maintaining tight risk controls. If price decisively breaches the 20-period SMA with strong volume, favor continuation setups targeting higher resistances. Should the market slip below key support, short-term traders might look to short retracements, but longer term holders should wait for a clearer trend confirmation before adjusting broader positioning."

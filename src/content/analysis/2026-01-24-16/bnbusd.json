The latest price action—trading in a very tight range between $886.53 and $888.70—suggests that buyers and sellers are in relative equilibrium. While the broader trend remains bullish on higher timeframes, the inability to decisively break above the recent short-term high points to a **cooling continuation pattern**. If bulls regain control above $891–$895, it could signal renewed upside momentum toward $920+ levels.\n\nThe **Simple Moving Average (20)** at **891.48** is currently acting as near-term resistance, with price lingering just below it. This implies that short-term momentum is slightly skewed to the downside. The missing RSI(14) makes oversold/overbought context unavailable, but the **MACD reading at -0.373** indicates that bearish momentum persists beneath the surface. Even though the MACD signal isn’t complete, the negative value suggests sellers retain a slight edge until clear crossovers occur.\n\nKey **support levels** to monitor include the intraday floor around **$885**, followed by a stronger psychological and structural support near **$860–$870**. If these zones break on increased volume, a deeper retracement toward $840 could unfold. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at the **20‑period SMA**, with a more meaningful barrier at **$900**. A convincing breakout above $900 could attract short‑term momentum traders and shift the next target to $920–$940.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑bound strategy** seems most prudent in the current environment. Long positions might be considered on dips near strong support (~$860–$870) with tight stops, while aggressive breakout traders could look for above‑$900 confirmation on volume. Risk‑averse participants may prefer to wait for clearer directional cues, such as a sustained break above the 20‑period SMA or a MACD crossover to the upside, before committing to new positions."

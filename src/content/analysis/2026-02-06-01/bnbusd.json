With the latest 24h high of *~$627.62* and a close under the 20‑day average, the prevailing trend looks sideways‑to‑down, hinting sellers have the upper hand unless price decisively breaks above nearby moving averages. Shorter time frames may show choppy range behavior before a clear directional bias re‑emerges. \n\nThe absence of an RSI reading complicates momentum interpretation, but the negative MACD suggests **downside momentum is present** despite a modest uptick in price. Traders should be cautious, as a negative MACD typically reflects weakening bullish strength and possible continuation of corrective moves. If an RSI were available showing oversold conditions, it could hint at a bounce; however, with the MACD in bearish territory, upside attempts may lack conviction until MACD begins tould be cautious, as a negative MACD typically reflects weakening bullish strength and possible continuation of corrective moves. If an RSI were available showing oversold conditions, it could hint at a bounce; however, with the MACD in bearish territory, upside attempts may lack conviction until MACD begins to flatten or turn upward. \n\nFrom a **support and resistance perspective**, the psychological range around **$610–$615** is important: this zone has historically acted as near‑term support, while resistance at approximately **$650–$660** represents an initial barrier for bulls. A failure to hold support could invite deeper selling toward lower confluence levels, potentially near **$580–$600** if bearish structures persist.

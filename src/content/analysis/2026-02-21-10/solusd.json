Recent price action is range‑bound with tight 24‑hour highs and lows, which often reflects market indecision before a breakout. Holding above the SMA gives a foundation for upward momentum, but lack of strong directional expansion keeps the trend *moderate* rather than emphatically bullish.\n\nMomentum indicators present a mixed picture. The MACD reading of **0.3603** above zero signals underlying bullish pressure, but absence of the signal line limits the depth of interpretation. Without a current RSI value, we can’t gauge overbought/oversold tension, so momentum confirmation relies heavily on price structure itself. The fact that price has modestly climbed with limited volatility suggests **gradual accumulation** rather than an explosive run.\n\nKey support lies near the SMA(20) zone around **$84.5–84.6**, a level that has repeatedly paused pullbacks. A break below this could expose the next support down near **$83.0–82.5**, where prior swing lows are clustered. On the upside, immediate resistance is around **$85.8–86.0**, with a more decisive barrier near **$88.0**, where sellers previously emerged. Clear breach and daily close above $86–88 may invite a more sustained rally toward **$90+**.\n\nTrading suggestions reflect balance between patience and risk management. For short‑term players, consider **long entries near $84.5 support** with tight stops below $84.0, targeting the $86 area, scaling out as strength builds. If momentum falters near resistance, shorter scalps or **range sell entries** could work with stops above $88. Longer‑term traders might wait for breakout confirmation above key resistance or deeper pullback to robust support before committing larger positions, keeping exposure sized to risk tolerance."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is currently trading around **$11.67**, showing minor bearish bias within a short-term downtrend. Price remains below the **20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)** at **$11.74**, suggesting sellers retain slight control. Recent candles have shown constrained volatility between **$11.67 and $11.70**, signaling consolidation after a modest pullback. For trend context, break and close above the SMA could hint at renewed upside, while failure to reclaim this level may extend sideways or lower movement.\n\nMomentum indicators are mixed. With **MACD below zero** and lacking a clear signal line crossover, there’s no confirmed bullish reversal yet. The absence of an RSI reading limits detailed strength measurement, but price action near the lower end of the recent range suggests weakening upward conviction. Traders should watch for MACD histogram contraction or crossover toward positive territory as a potential early builder of bullish momentum. Conversely, deeper histogram expansion downward could accelerate the current drift.\n\nKey short-term support lies at **$11.50**, followed by a more psychological support around **$11.20**. Immediate resistance is anchored by the **20 SMA** near **$11.74**, with stronger congestion likely between **$12.00 and $12.20**. A decisive move past that zone could pave the way for retesting higher levels. A breakdown below **$11.50** would warrant cautious positioning, possibly opening the door for deeper correction toward prior lows.\n\nFor traders, consider a **range-based approach** given the tight band and lack of clear directional conviction. Long entries might be favored on a confirmed bounce off **$11.50 support**, with stops below recent lows and targets around **$11.80–$12.00**. Short positions could be more compelling if price fails near the **20 SMA** and breaks lower, emphasizing disciplined risk management. Monitoring macro crypto sentiment and volume will add useful context to these technical levels."

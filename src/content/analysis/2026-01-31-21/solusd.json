      "content": "当前，SOL/USD处于103.25美元附近，价格呈现出较为震荡的走势，略显承压。昨日的波动区间在103.44美元和101.22美元之间，显示市场情绪较为谨慎。尽管价格未大幅突破，但仍维持在一定区间内整理。\n\n从技术指标来看，RSI暂时缺失，但MACD值为-3.98638，显示短期内卖压较重，可能存在进一步回调的风险。20日简单移动平均(SMA)为111.85美元，表明当前价格低于短期均线，趋势偏弱，市场可能面临压力。\n\n支撑位方面，101.22美元是近期低点，若突破此位置可能会加剧下行压力，进一步支撑位在99.00美元左右。阻力位则集中在103.44美元附近，若突破该水平，可能恢复上涨动力，下一目标可能是106.00美元。\n\n建议投资者保持谨慎观望，短期内可以关注支撑位的测试情况。若价格突破103.44美元，则可以考虑轻仓入场，但需要注意整体市场的调整风险。"

This suggests sellers still control momentum and buyers lack conviction at current levels. While daily volatility is limited between **$103.44** high and **$101.22** low, the broader pullback from earlier monthly highs around the low‑$130s reflects weakening demand pressure in recent sessions. \n\nThe absence of a valid RSI reading makes direct momentum gauging difficult, yet the negative MACD suggests trend pressure remains to the downside. A negative MACD typically means the short‑term moving average crosses below a longer one, reinforcing selling bias, even if the signaly selection. SOL closing prices.

A negative MACD typically means the short‑term moving average crosses below a longer one, reinforcing selling bias, even if the signal line isn’t currently available. The failure to reclaim the SMA(20) strengthens bearish conviction. In this context, traders should view any rebounds cautiously unless confirmed with stronger volume and positive momentum signals. \n\nKey support appears near **$100–$98**, a psychological zone that aligns with recent intraday lows and broader historicalce floors. Below that, extended selling could push SOL toward **$90** or lower supports observed in past consolidation periods. On the upside, immediate resistance sits near **$110–$112** around the SMA, followed by the **$125–$130** area where prior swing lows and highs clustered before the recent decline. A sustained break above these zones would be necessary for trend reversal. \n\nFor trading suggestions, short‑term traders might consider tactical long exposure only if SOL convincingly closes above the **$112–$115** range with strengthening volume, or conversely use breakdowns under **$100** to define scalp short positions on CoinMarketCap.

Longer‑term investors should wait for clearer confirmation of trend reversal — potentially a cross above the 20‑period SMA with rising on‑chain activity or institutional inflows — before scaling into new positions. \n> **[Solana (SOL) Price Trends on January 31, 2026: WisdomTree’s Move Meets Market Pressure](https://insidebitcoins.com/sponsored/solana-sol-price-trends-on-january-31-2026-wisdomtrees-move-meets-market-pressure?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *insidebitcoins.com* · 2026/1/31\n> Solana (SOL) remains under pressure near key support levels as bearish momentum persists while WisdomTree’s move meets market pressure."

The inability to reclaim this moving average confirms sellers still dominate momentum. That said, the 24‑hour range has been narrow and muted, suggesting the market is in a consolidation phase rather than free‑falling, with price action likely to remain range‑bound until decisive follow‑through above immediate resistance or below support.\n\nLooking at momentum indicators, the MACD at **‑0.045** reflects ongoing bearish pressure, although a slight uptick from deeper negatives could mark early stabilization. The lack of available current RSI complicates real‑time momentum interpretation, but nearby data from broader analysis suggests neutral to slightly weak readings in lower price regimes, consistent with consolidation. Divergences between MACD and price lows in other analyses have historically indicated bounce potential; however, these setups require confirmation with volume expansion before committing to directional bias.\n\nKey technical levels form the backbone of a structured trading plan. Near‑term resistance lies around **$12.00–12.10** (20 SMA confluence and pivot resistance), with a stronger barrier near **$13.20** as a breakout target if bullish conviction returns. On the downside, robust support is observed near **$11.50** — break that and sellers may push toward **$11.00** or lower. These levels align with recent volatility patterns and widely referenced consolidation bands becoming reference zones for disciplined entry and exit points. \n\nFor traders, a cautious approach is advisable. A breakout strategy could involve initiating long positions once price closes above the 20 SMA with confirmatory volume, targeting the $13+ region while placing stops below $11.50 to manage risk. Conversely, if the price loses $11.50 support on increasing momentum, short‑term traders might consider downsideorrelation with BTC and ETH in December 2025.

The lack of a strong bullish crossover or reliable RSI confirmation keeps momentum **neutral to bearish** in the short run. The 20‑period SMA acting as resistance reinforces this view, indicating that **bullish trend reversal won’t gain traction** until this moving average is reclaimed convincingly on increasing volume. \n\nKey **support levels** to watch include **$76–$78**, where buyers have historically stepped in, and a breakdown belowurce=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed SOL USD forecast as well as a Solana US Dollar Binance technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nKey **support levels** to watch include **$76–$78**, where buyers have historically stepped in, and a breakdown below that zone could expose deeper downside toward levels near **$67**, a potential next support cluster if bearish structure accelerates.

Conversely, shorter positions or protective hedging around current levels could be reasonable if support near **$76** fails decisively, as thisay open the door to more aggressive downside.

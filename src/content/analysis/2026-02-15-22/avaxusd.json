Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$9.25** suggests a cautious short-term environment. The recent 24-hour range is extremely narrow, indicating low volatility and market indecision. With the price trading below the **20-period simple moving average (~9.41)**, short-term momentum leans slightly bearish. The lack of a defined RSI complicates momentum confirmation, but the current structure hints that buyers aren’t stepping in strongly, and sellers maintain mild control near resistance zones.\n\nThe **MACD’s negative reading (~-0.0596)** points to ongoing bearish momentum, though without the signal line value it’s hard to assess crossover dynamics. Still, negative MACD values generally reflect diminishing bullish pressure and potential for continued consolidation or downside tests. If the MACD remains below zero and moving further away from the signal, it suggests that bearish order flow could persist, keeping the market in a grinding range rather than fueling a breakout to the upside.\n\nKey technical levels to watch include immediate support near **$9.15–$9.20**, which has acted as a short-term floor in recent sessions. Below this, the **$9.00** psychological mark becomes significant, and a breach might invite deeper retracements toward multi-week lows. On the upside, the **20-SMA near $9.41** serves as the first resistance hurdle; a sustained move above it could encourage short-covering. A stronger resistance zone forms around **$9.60–$9.70**, where previous supply emerged.\n\nFor tactical trading, consider a **range-oriented approach** until volatility returns. Shorter-term traders might look to buy near established support with tight stops, targeting the 20-SMA, while more aggressive sellers could re-enter on rallies toward **$9.40–$9.50**. Breakouts above or below these zones with volume confirmation would increase confidence in directional plays. Always weigh risk management, as low liquidity and hesitancy could lead to false moves."

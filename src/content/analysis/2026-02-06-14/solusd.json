The slight negative momentum (down ~0.78% over 24 h) indicates that short‑term sentiment is cautious, and with MACD presently negative, downward pressure persists. Generally, when price sits above a key average like the SMA20, it suggests an underlying uptrend still has a chance to prevail if confirmed by strengthening momentum. \n\nIndicator interpretation currently points to mixed momentum — the negative MACD reading (‑1.13726) without a clear signal line crossover signals that bearish momentum is still present but not accelerating dramatically. In typical technical frameworks, a negative MACD below its signal line suggests sellers maintain control, and without an improving RSI or visibleints to mixed momentum — the negative MACD reading (‑1.13726) without a clear signal line crossover signals that bearish momentum is still present but not accelerating dramatically. In typical technical frameworks, a negative MACD below its signal line suggests sellers maintain control, and without an improving RSI or visible rebound above short‑term averages, it’s prudent to view strength with caution. The absence of an RSI figure here means reliance on the SMA and MACD context is critical, and the current readings lean toward a consolidation range rather than decisive trend shift. \n\nFrom a **support/resistance** perspective, intraday action shows immediate support around the $80 regionrt/resistance** perspective, intraday action shows immediate support around the $80 region, anchored by the SMA20 and recent lows near $82.30. Slightly lower, psychological support around $75–$78 could act as a buffer if selling intensifies. Above, notable resistance exists just over recent highs near ~$83–$85; breaking this zone with volume could prompt a re‑test of higher resistance bands, though major historical resistance levels for broader timeframesll above current prices. \n\n**Trading suggestions** in this environment lean toward range‑based tactics. Short‑term traders might look for dips toward the $79–$80 support to scale in with tight stops, or play breakouts above the $84–$85 resistance with confirmation and volume. More conservative positions may wait for clearer momentum signals and recent consolidation zone. $80: Aligns with previous price action and trendlines.

More conservative positions may wait for clearer momentum signals — such as a MACD crossover or price reclaiming and holding above a middle‑term average. Risk‑aware traders should manage positions carefully, as volatility in crypto can quickly test support levels. \n> **[Technical Analysis of Solana (COINBASE:SOLUSD) — TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/technicals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *TradingView*\n> Which technical analysis tools can be used to analyze Solana?

After testing the intraday high near **1.38113**, the pair retraced toward **1.36667**, settling around **1.37028** at last update. This suggests sellers remain active at short‑term highs, yet the inability to push sharply lower points to underlying demand. The prevailing short‑term trend leans slightly upward, but momentum lacks strength until a decisive break above **1.3900–1.4000** resistance.\n\nTechnically, the price hovering above the **20‑period SMA ~1.3503** reinforces a cautiously constructive backdrop. This moving average is acting as dynamic support, indicating buyers step in on dips. The absence of a calculated **RSI(14)** complicates momentum evaluation, though price behavior around the SMA suggests that downside exhaustion may be forming. The **MACD** positive reading at roughly **0.0046** implies emerging bullish momentum, albeit without a reported signal line value to confirm a clear cross. Intraday oscillators would help, but current metrics hint momentum is tepid rather than strong.\n\nKey horizontal levels are shaping the structure. On the upside, immediate resistance clusters around **1.3800–1.3900**, with a more meaningful barrier near **1.4000** where prior swing highs congregate. Support lies first at the **20‑SMA near 1.3500**, then around **1.3400–1.3450**, a zone of previous consolidation. A break below **1.3300** would weaken the near‑term trend and invite deeper retracement toward **1.3200** or lower. Conversely, a sustained push above **1.3900** opens the door toward **1.4200**.\n\nFor traders, a balanced approach is wise. Consider long entries near **1.3500–1.3600** with tight risk controls, targeting **1.3800–1.4000** on initial strength. Shorts could be selectively explored on clear rejections above **1.3850** with stops above **1.4000**, aiming for **1.3500**. Manage exposure and watch for volume confirmation around key levels before committing."

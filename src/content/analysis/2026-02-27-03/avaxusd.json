Price is mostly range‑bound between roughly **$9.32–$9.38** in the last 24 hours, indicating indecision. On a bigger picture, historical data shows AVAX in a longer downward channel on higher timeframes, pointing to a **bearish macro trend** until proven otherwise. \n\nWith the limited indicator set you provided, the **MACDps://www.tradingview.com/symbols/AVAXUSD/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *tradingview.com*\n> AVAX / USD [AVALANCHE] EWP TC FIB ANALYSIS WEEKLY TF AVAX remains inside a long-term descending channel, keeping the macro bias bearish. The 2024 rally topped near the 0.618 Fib + channel resistance, consistent with a Wave B in an ABC correction. Price has since broken support and appears to be unfolding Wave C, likely as a 5-wave impulse ...\n\n\nWith the limited indicator set you provided, the **MACD value positive** but without its signal line makes it hard to confirm a crossover. Still, MACD slightly above zero can hint at emerging bullish momentum if confirmed by the signal line in the next sessions. The 20‑period SMA acting as dynamic support suggests buyers are defending that level, but the absence of the RSI reading limits clarity on overbought/oversold conditions. In broader data, RSI readings fromer sources lean toward neutral to slightly oversold, implying potential for a bounce if sentiment improves. \n\nOn support and resistance, look for immediate **support near $9.20–$9.30** (SMA cluster and recent lows), with next levels closer to weaker structural supports around **$8.80–$8.50** on deeper pullbacks. Resistance is expected moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nOn support and resistance, look for immediate **support near $9.20–$9.30** (SMA cluster and recent lows), with next levels closer to weaker structural supports around **$8.80–$8.50** on deeper pullbacks. Resistance is expected near **$9.40–$9.50** initially, and a break above that could open a run toward prior swing highs around **$10+**. Broader historical resistances (from bigger timeframes) are much higher around $12–$13, but these may be out of reach without stronger market catalysts. \n\nGiven the current setup, a cautious, **range‑trading approach** could be sensible: consider long entries near the lower support band with tight stops below ~$9.10, andal analysis for Avalanche AVAX including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nGiven the current setup, a cautious, **range‑trading approach** could be sensible: consider long entries near the lower support band with tight stops below ~$9.10, and short near resistance if momentum weakens. Breakouts above $9.50 with volume could signal a short‑term bullish shift. Conversely, if AVAX fails support and breaks below key levels, risk management dictates tightening stops or scaling out to preserve capital, especially in a still uncertain broader crypto market."

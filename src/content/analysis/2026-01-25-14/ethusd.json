      "title": "以太坊/美元技术分析：短线承压的震荡整理走势",
      "content": "从走势结构看，ETH/USD当前价格运行在2928附近，明显低于20日均线，短线趋势偏弱。日内高低点波动收窄，显示多空力量暂时平衡，但上方抛压仍占主导，整体以震荡整理为主。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD数值为-5.63，处于零轴下方，动能柱偏空，说明下行动能尚未完全释放。RSI暂缺虽无法量化强弱，但结合价格未能重回均线之上，市场情绪仍偏谨慎。\n\n支撑与阻力方面，短线关键支撑位位于2920一线，若跌破则可能测试2900心理关口。上方初步阻力在2945附近，对应20日均线位置，进一步阻力则在2980区域，突破难度较大。\n\n交易策略上，偏向短线保守思路。激进者可在2920附近轻仓试多，严格止损；稳健者等待有效站稳2945后再考虑跟进多单。若反弹受阻，可关注高位回落的短空机会，控制仓位为宜。"

      "title": "Ethereum vs US Dollar Technical Analysis",
      "content": "Ethereum is currently facing a slight bearish trend, as indicated by its minor 24-hour price decline of -0.46%. The price has fluctuated between a high of 2942.71 and a low of 2924.5, suggesting a consolidation phase within a narrow range. Despite this, the market is not showing any significant trend reversal signals at the moment. ETH/USD remains close to its 20-period simple moving average (SMA) of 2946.53, reinforcing the current lack of strong directional momentum. If the price breaks below 2924.5, it could signal further downward movement.\n\nIn terms of technical indicators, the absence of a clear RSI value makes it difficult to assess immediate overbought or oversold conditions. However, the MACD reading of -5.62678 suggests bearish momentum, especially when the lack of a signal line prevents a comprehensive interpretation. The negative MACD value implies that selling pressure may outweigh buying interest, reinforcing the possibility of price weakness in the near term. Should the MACD begin to show bullish divergence, there may be room for a reversal, but the current signal is not promising.\n\nSupport levels for Ethereum are located at the recent low of 2924.5, and further downside could test 2900 if the bearish trend continues. On the resistance side, the 2942.71 level is the first barrier to watch. A break above this level could trigger a move toward the SMA at 2946.53, with a potential push higher if bullish momentum builds. If the price clears this resistance zone convincingly, a return to recent highs above 3000 is possible.\n\nFor traders, a cautious approach is recommended in the current market environment. Short-term trades should monitor price action closely around the key support and resistance levels. Given the bearish MACD and lack of other strong bullish signals, short positions may be favorable on bearish breaks below 2924.5, while long positions could be considered only if ETH/USD sustains a move above the 2946.53 SMA, supported by a positive MACD crossover."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s recent price action around **$125.84** reflects a modest bearish tilt after failing to sustain a rebound above the short‑term moving average. The 20‑period simple moving average at **$126.73** currently acts as a dynamic resistance, suggesting sellers still dominate near that zone. Price rejection near the day’s high **$126.80** further signals reluctance from buyers to push beyond recent distribution levels. A break below the immediate swing low near **$125.00** could open the door to deeper pullbacks.\n\nDespite the lack of a complete RSI reading, the available momentum structure shows weakness. The MACD’s negative value (**–0.2057**) without an accompanying signal line reference suggests downward bias in the oscillator’s trend. This aligns with price struggling under the SMA(20), underlining short‑term bearish momentum. Without clear oversold conditions confirmed by a reliable RSI, traders should interpret the current momentum as cautious rather than capitulative, favoring a wait‑and‑see approach until clearer signals emerge.\n\nKey intraday support appears near **$125.00** and a more significant zone around **$122.50–$123.00**, where buyers previously stepped in. If that zone collapses on strong volume, it could accelerate selling toward **$120.00**. Resistance clusters begin at the 20‑period SMA (~**$126.70**), followed by **$128.50** and the recent swing high near **$130.00**. These levels can serve as benchmark objectives for any bullish attempt, but the inability to clear them convincingly would reinforce bearish control.\n\nFor traders, consider short positions on clear rejections near resistance with tight risk just above **$127.00**. Long entries may be more appropriate near strong support zones, ideally accompanied by a bullish reversal pattern and confirmation from momentum indicators. Until the price decisively closes above the SMA(20) with expanding volume, bias remains slightly bearish to neutral, with careful risk management paramount."

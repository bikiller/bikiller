      "content": "当前雪崩币（AVAX）在12.22美元附近震荡整理，市场缺乏明显的方向性。价格波动幅度较小，高低点分别为12.2613和12.2134，显示出市场情绪较为谨慎。从短期趋势来看，价格保持在20日简单移动平均线（SMA）12.20162附近，表明市场在这一水平附近存在一定支撑。\n\nMACD指标显示出轻微的负值（-0.0259），但没有形成明确的卖出信号。目前未能确认RSI指标的数值，因此我们无法通过该指标进一步判断超买或超卖情况。MACD的负值暗示市场可能偏向弱势，但没有强烈的下行压力。\n\n短期内，支撑位在12.20美元附近，若价格突破此位，可能会进一步下探12.13美元的支撑。阻力位则位于12.26美元，突破该水平可能引发更大的反弹行情。投资者可以关注这些关键水平，选择在支撑附近逐步建仓，或在突破阻力时采取逢高做多策略。\n\n建议目前的操作策略是保持谨慎，待价格突破区间的支撑或阻力时再做决策。在确认突破后，进一步跟踪MACD和RSI指标的变化，寻找更有力的进场信号。"

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche is showing a **mildly bearish to neutral short-term structure** around the current $12.22 price. The slight 24‑hour dip and very tight high/low range suggest **low volatility** and market indecision. Price is hovering near the 20‑period simple moving average at $12.20, indicating equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Unless momentum picks up, this flat drift could persist, with price oscillating sideways rather than trending sharply up or down.\n\nThe **MACD reading in negative territory** reflects subdued bearish momentum — sellers slightly outweigh buyers but not forcefully. Without a signal line value it’s hard to confirm a crossover, yet the modest MACD figure warns that upside momentum isn’t strong. In this context, the absence of an RSI makes it harder to gauge overbought/oversold extremes, but the tight trading suggests neither condition is present. Overall, indicators lean toward **neutral‑bearish bias**, not a clear breakout signal.\n\nKey **support** resides near recent intraday lows around **$12.00–$12.10**, where shallow pullbacks have found bids today. A breach below this zone could invite deeper tests of **$11.70–$11.80**, a psychological and prior demand area. On the upside, initial **resistance** near $12.40 must crack before more ambitious levels like **$12.70–$12.80** come into play. Holding above the 20‑SMA and first support is critical for keeping near‑term structure intact.\n\nFor traders, patience is sensible until volatility expands. **Range‑bound strategies** (buying near support, trimming near resistance) fit current conditions best, with strict stops just below support to limit risk. Breakouts above $12.40 with volume could signal a shift toward renewed bullish interest, whereas closes below $12.00 may invite short‑term downside. Position sizing and clear exit levels remain essential in this cautious phase."

With the latest print at **1.8704**, price remains below the 20-period simple moving average (SMA) at **1.89524**, signaling that short-term momentum favors sellers. The tight high/low range underscores a lack of decisive directional conviction. Unless buyers reclaim the SMA zone, the path of least resistance stays skewed to the downside.\n\nCurrent momentum indicators point to exhaustion rather than an aggressive move. The **MACD at –0.01034** reflects lingering bearish pressure, even though the absence of a signal line value limits a full crossover assessment. This divergence below the SMA suggests waning buying strength has yet to translate into a strong sell-off. Traders should watch for an MACD histogram expansion below zero, which could confirm intensifying bearish momentum.\n\nKey levels to observe include the **support around 1.85–1.86**, where recent price tests found temporary stability, and a **resistance cluster near 1.90–1.92**, aligning with the SMA and prior swing highs. A close above the 1.90 region could invite renewed buyer interest, framing a more bullish structure. Conversely, a break under 1.85 might expose the **1.80 psychological zone** as the next area of interest for tactical longs.\n\nGiven the current structure, cautious traders might favor range-based strategies while volatility remains subdued. Buying near established support with tight stops could work if confirmation appears (e.g., bullish rejection wicks or positive momentum shifts). Shorter positions might be considered on rallies toward the resistance band, provided the price fails to sustain above the SMA, keeping risk parameters well defined."

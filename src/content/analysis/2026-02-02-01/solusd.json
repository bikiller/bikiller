This suggests that the immediate trend is neutral to slightly bearish as price hovers below this key SMA, indicating sellers are still modestly in control. The small 24-hour decline and tight **100.32–103.04** range imply reduced directional conviction, with volatility compressing as traders await a breakout. A decisive daily close above the SMA would be needed to tilt sentiment back toward short-term bullish. \n\nThe MACD reading at **–1.54058** points to continued bearish momentum, signalling that downward pressure is still present. In typical MACD use, values below zero imply sellers dominate, and without a signal line crossover to the upside, this momentum indicator remains unfavorable for longs. Meanwhile, although RSI data isn’t provided here, external real-time scans often show RSI lurking near neutral or oversold zones in recentlues below zero imply sellers dominate, and without a signal line crossover to the upside, this momentum indicator remains unfavorable for longs. Meanwhile, although RSI data isn’t provided here, external real-time scans often show RSI lurking near neutral or oversold zones in recent sessions, which highlights the potential for short-covering rebounds if buyers step in near major supports. \n\nImmediate support lies close to **$100**, a psychological round number reinforced by recent lows, and further down around **$95–$98** if volatility expands. On the upside, the **$105–$106** zone marks the first resistance cluster, with more significant congestion near **$110–$112** based on recent intraday pivot structures.igh of $118.54 and a low of $100.65 within the same period, indicating high volatility with a daily range of 17.89%.\n\n\nImmediate support lies close to **$100**, a psychological round number reinforced by recent lows, and further down around **$95–$98** if volatility expands. On the upside, the **$105–$106** zone marks the first resistance cluster, with more significant congestion near **$110–$112** based on recent intraday pivot structures. Traders should treat these levels as decision points: a break above resistance with volume could invite fresh longs, while a breakdown under key support would accelerate bearish flows. \n\nFor trading suggestions, a range-bound approach makes sense until conviction improves. Short-term buyers might look for bounces off support with tight stops, targeting the SMA and nearby resistance, while aggressive sellers could lean into failed strength near **$105+**.

Longer bias shifts require confirmation — namely sustained closes above the 20-period MA or a MACD trend shift — before committing larger positions. Always manage risk, especially given crypto’s typical volatility."

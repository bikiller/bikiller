      "title": "以太坊/美元技术分析：短期偏弱震荡",
      "content": "从价格结构看，ETH/USD 当前运行在近期区间中下沿，最新价低于20日均线，反弹力度有限，显示短期趋势仍偏弱，整体以震荡整理为主，多头动能尚未完全恢复。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD数值为负且处于零轴下方，空头动能仍占优势，短线反弹更多属于技术性修复。RSI数据暂缺，需结合价格行为判断，当前尚未出现明显超卖信号。\n\n支撑与阻力方面，下方重要支撑位关注2249附近的日内低点区域，若跌破可能测试前期成交密集区；上方阻力首先在2350一线，对应20日均线，其次是2318附近的短期高点。\n\n交易策略上，稳健型投资者可等待价格回踩支撑后的企稳信号再考虑低吸，激进交易者可在区间内高抛低吸，严格控制仓位，并关注均线与动能指标的同步转强确认。"

With the latest price near $2,305 and a slightly positive 24-hour change, the downtrend from earlier resistance levels still influences price action. That said, price staying above the recent intraday low (~$2,249) keeps the pullback contained for now, hinting at neutral-to-bearish bias rather than a clear reversal.\n\nMomentum indicators paint a **mixed picture**. Your MACD at -50 suggests that bearish momentum is still present, even though the signal line isn’t provided; typically a negative MACD indicates sellers retaining control in recent sessions. The absence of an RSI figure limits overbought/oversold context, but being under the SMA20 usually aligns with short-term bearish bias. This aligns with broader sell signals on daily charts seen elsewhere, where moving averages and other indicators pointed toward downside continuation rather than immediate accumulation. \n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, immediateg.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/ethereum/eth-usd-technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed ETH USD forecast as well as a Ethereum US Dollar Binance technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, immediate support lies around the recent low near $2,249–$2,250. A break below this could expose psychological levels around $2,200 and possibly the next buyers’ interest zone closer to $2,100–$2,125 if broader market pressure intensifies. On the upside, resistance begins around the SMA20 (~$2,350), with stronger zones above from prior swing highs around $2,800–$2,900 seen in broader technical surveys. Sustained closes above these could shift traders’ attention back to the upside. \n\n**For trading suggestions**, cautious traders might wait for a decisive break either above the $2,350–$2,380 zone with volume confirmation or a cleansting.com*\n> Detailed ETH USD forecast as well as a Ethereum US Dollar Binance technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\n**For trading suggestions**, cautious traders might wait for a decisive break either above the $2,350–$2,380 zone with volume confirmation or a clean retest and bounce off current support before entering longs. Short-term range traders could scalp between support and resistance while broader trends stay unresolved. Risk-defined setups with tight stops beneath key support would help manage volatility given the prevailing bearish undertones."

The fact that price sits just below the **20-period SMA at ~104.37** suggests sideways to mildly lower dynamics, with sellers having slight control. Broader market contexts show SOL struggling to maintain higher ranges after extended declines from recent multi-month highs, reinforcing caution on trend direction. \n\nAlthough traditional momentum oscillators like RSI are not provided here, available metrics such as the negative MACD reading indicate bearish momentum, implying downside persistence until buyers decisively enter. A MACD below zero means the shorter-term trend is weaker than longer averages, usually a bearish sign unless a crossover back above the signal line occurs. Given broader technical frameworks, confirmatory momentum checks would be prudent to anticipate potential shifts. \n\nIn terms of **supporth as the negative MACD reading indicate bearish momentum, implying downside persistence until buyers decisively enter. A MACD below zero means the shorter-term trend is weaker than longer averages, usually a bearish sign unless a crossover back above the signal line occurs. Given broader technical frameworks, confirmatory momentum checks would be prudent to anticipate potential shifts. \n> **[Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis - Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/solana/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed SOL forecast as well as a Solana technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, immediate support exists near recent lows around **$104** and psychological floors around **$100–$96** from classical pivot analyses, which could absorb selling pressure. On the upside, resistance levels cluster near **$116–$120**, with higher barriers closer to **$127–$136**, where buyer interest and prior pivot points have emerged. A break above these resistance zones could flip bias, but failure to reclaim them keeps the bearish narrative intact. turn0search25\n\nFor traders, a cautious approach is reasonable: consider waiting for confirmation of trend reversal signals before initiating aggressive long positions. Range-based strategies between support and resistance could work in the short term, while breakout traders might watch for closes above **$120** for upside momentum or below **$100** for acceleration to lower supports. Position sizing and clearly defined stop targets around key technical thresholds willld work in the short term, while breakout traders might watch for closes above **$120** for upside momentum or below **$100** for acceleration to lower supports. Position sizing and clearly defined stop targets around key technical thresholds will help manage risk in this volatile environment."

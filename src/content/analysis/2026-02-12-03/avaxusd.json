Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is showing a tentative **bullish bias around the $8.75 area** after stabilizing above the short-term SMA(20) at **$8.64**. Price action over the past 24 hours is relatively flat, suggesting consolidation rather than decisive directional movement. Traders should note the inability to break significantly above **$8.76–$8.80 resistance**, indicating sellers remain present at higher levels. A sustained move above this zone could invite further upside toward **$9.10–$9.25**.\n\nWithout a conventional RSI value available, momentum interpretation leans on MACD’s positive histogram reading (~0.004). That modest uptick hints at building bullish momentum, but with the signal line unavailable, the strength of this move is unclear. The SMA(20) slope is gently upward, which supports a short-term bullish framework, but lack of broader confirmation suggests caution. If buyers lose grip, expect renewed downward pressure.\n\nSupport around **$8.60–$8.50** is key. A break below this level might open the door to deeper tests near **$8.30–$8.20**, where longer-term buyers could be more active. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at **$8.80**, followed by a cluster at **$9.00–$9.15**. These zones act as logical areas where profit-taking or new supply might arise. Range-bound conditions often persist in low-volatility environments, and this could continue until a catalyst arrives.\n\nFor traders considering entry, a **neutral to cautiously bullish stance makes sense** in the current landscape. Scalpers may target long positions near support with tight stops, while breakout traders could wait for a clear breach above **$8.80** with volume confirmation. Risk management should prioritize defined exit levels, given the relatively thin momentum signals. Longer-term holders might treat pullbacks toward **$8.40–$8.20** as accumulation opportunities if broader sentiment remains positive."

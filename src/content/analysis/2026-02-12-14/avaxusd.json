      "content": "Avalanche (AVAX) has been showing slight consolidation in the $8.90 region, with the price fluctuating between $8.8853 and $8.9345 over the past 24 hours. This narrow range suggests a period of indecision in the market, as the coin struggles to establish a clear direction. The lack of significant movement points to a potential accumulation phase or a pause before a larger move. If the price fails to break above the upper range, it might indicate continued sideways action or a retest of lower levels.\n\nThe 20-period simple moving average (SMA) at $8.78916 acts as a dynamic support in the short term. The price currently sits just above this level, hinting at a mild bullish bias. However, if the price falls below the SMA, it could suggest a shift towards a bearish momentum. Traders should watch for a close near this level to determine whether the support holds or if a breakdown is imminent. A decisive move above $9.00 would likely confirm a bullish breakout, targeting higher resistance levels.\n\nIndicators such as the MACD remain neutral, with the value of 0.057967124 signaling a very weak bullish sentiment. However, without a clear signal line or RSI data, the momentum remains unclear. If the MACD starts to gain strength and crosses above its signal line, it could confirm an upward shift in momentum. Conversely, a drop in MACD would point to weakening buying pressure. Traders should monitor for stronger directional cues once the market stabilizes or forms a more defined trend.\n\nKey support is located at the $8.85 level, just above the recent lows. A break below this level could lead to further declines toward $8.50, marking the next significant support area. On the upside, resistance is found near $9.10, followed by $9.30. For active traders, a range-bound strategy between these levels may be suitable, while longer-term investors should wait for a breakout confirmation."

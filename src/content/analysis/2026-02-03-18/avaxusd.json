Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nThe short-term trend for AVAX/USD appears mildly bearish to neutral. Price is trading below the 20-period simple moving average at **10.06**, indicating short-term sellers retain control. Recent highs near **9.80** failed to hold, and lows around **9.73** suggest the market is consolidating within a narrow range. This lack of momentum reflects indecision, with neither bulls nor bears driving a breakout. Traders should watch for a decisive break above **10.10–10.20** to signal renewed upside potential.\n\nWithout an available RSI figure, momentum interpretation leans on price action and MACD. The MACD reading of **–0.0538** without an available signal line suggests bearish momentum, implying that downward pressure could persist if the MACD doesn’t start curling back up. The absence of signal values limits clarity, but the negative MACD typically reflects that recent price losses outweigh gains. A rising MACD and crossover above its signal line would be needed to confirm a shift toward bullish momentum.\n\nKey support and resistance levels are fairly well defined in the current range. Immediate support lies at **9.70–9.75**, a zone buyers have defended over recent sessions. If that gives way, the next support could be psychological round number **9.50**, which often attracts order flow. On the upside, resistance begins at **9.80**, with more substantial supply around the 20-period SMA near **10.06**. Only a sustained break above **10.20** would increase the odds of testing higher resistance near **10.50** or beyond.\n\nIn terms of trading suggestions, range-bound strategies may suit the current environment. Short-term swing traders could consider buying support near **9.70** with tight stops below **9.65**, aiming for **9.90–10.10** targets. Breakout traders might wait for clear closes above **10.20** with volume confirmation before entering longs, while short positions could be considered on failures below **9.65**. Always manage risk and adjust based on incoming data."

The lack of a visible RSI value and an unsettled MACD reading near **–0.0579** implies weakening upward momentum and limited conviction among buyers. Without indicator confirmation, the market is in a tentative consolidation phase, where range trading is more likely than decisive breakouts.\n\nFrom a broader trend perspective, AVAX has been under structural pressure versus USD, often generating sell signals across moving averages in longer timeframes and failing to sustain higher support zones historically. On larger charts, analysts have pointed to multi‑month downtrends and technical sell bias, reflecting a market still digesting prior gains and macro volatility. This persistent bearish backdrop means short‑term strength needs clear validation from trend continuation above moving averages before bulls regain control. \n\nKey support and resistance levels frame actionable zones.

Near current levels, immediate support clusters can be inferred around recent intraday lows near **9.20** and psychologically significant zones below that, where buyers may step back in. If selling intensifies, a break under these pivot points could accelerate test of deeper floors. On the upside, traders should watch for price reclaiming the **20‑SMA**, with stronger hurdles likely above, where previous reaction points have existed on larger timeframes. Longer‑term resistance often appears much higher, reflecting historical price bands that require broader recovery momentum. \n\nIn terms of execution, those considering **short positions** might favor incremental entries on lower highs while maintaining tight risk limits, given limited bullish confirmations. Conversely, **long positions** could be staged only upon clear indicator support — such as a MACD crossover into positive territory or reclaiming key moving averages — coupled with higher timeframe while maintaining tight risk limits, given limited bullish confirmations. Conversely, **long positions** could be staged only upon clear indicator support — such as a MACD crossover into positive territory or reclaiming key moving averages — coupled with higher timeframe trend breaks. Conservative traders may prefer to await clearer directional cues or trade within the defined range until volatility and trend signals align more cohesively."

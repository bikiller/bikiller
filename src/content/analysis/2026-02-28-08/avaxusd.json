      "title": "雪崩币/美元技术分析：市场震荡，短期承压",
      "content": "当前AVAX/USD价格为8.5226，全天下跌1.18%。从价格走势来看，当前市场处于震荡整理状态，价格在8.51至8.62区间内波动，缺乏明确的方向。整体来看，市场情绪较为谨慎，短期内可能会维持低位震荡。\n\n技术指标方面，RSI数据暂缺，但MACD当前为负值（-0.136），显示市场整体力量偏空。尽管如此，价格尚未突破重要支撑位，表明下行压力较小。SMA(20)为8.87382，价格低于均线，进一步确认短期内市场走势略显弱势。\n\n支撑位方面，8.51附近是短期关键支撑区域，一旦跌破，可能会加速下行，考验8.30和8.00的进一步支撑。而8.62是当前的阻力位，若价格突破，可能会引发一轮反弹，测试8.80至9.00区间。\n\n交易建议：鉴于当前震荡格局，短期内可考虑在支撑位附近寻求买入机会，同时在8.62附近设立卖出止盈位。若价格突破8.62，考虑逐步加仓。"

Write 3-4 paragraphs, 60-80 words each, total 250-300 words\\n2. Include: trend analysis, indicator interpretation, support/resistance levels, trading suggestions\\n3. Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action recently shows a **slightly bearish to neutral trend** as AVAX trades below the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA) at **8.8738**. Current price around **8.52** indicates sellers retain control near short‑term levels, though the narrow range between the session high and low reflects consolidation. Unless buyers reclaim and hold above the 20‑SMA, the short‑term trend may remain biased to the downside.\n\nThe available **momentum indicators** paint a cautious picture. The MACD at **–0.1362** suggests bearish momentum persists, but without the signal line value it’s unclear how strong the crossover context is. **RSI(14) is unavailable**, which limits confirmation of overbought/oversold conditions. Given these gaps, we infer momentum is weak but not deeply oversold, implying price could continue sideways before a decisive move.\n\nKey **support and resistance levels** to watch are at the recent swing low near **8.50**, followed by a psychological support at **8.00**. Immediate resistance lies around the 20‑SMA near **8.87**, then the prior range high near **9.20–9.40**. A break above the 20‑SMA with volume would shift bias toward buyers, while a breakdown under **8.50** could accelerate selling pressure and invite stops toward **8.00**.\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, cautious positioning makes sense. On the long side, consider entries only if AVAX clears and holds above **8.90–9.00** with confirming volume, targeting **9.40** and **9.80**. For shorter trades, break/close below **8.50** could signal a move toward **8.00** with a tight stop above **8.70**. Risk management is key; volatility around critical levels suggests smaller position sizes and clear stop levels until trend clarity improves."

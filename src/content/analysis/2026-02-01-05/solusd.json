Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action around **$104–105** suggests a **neutral-to-bearish near-term trend**. After failing to sustain higher levels, recent candles show limited upside momentum. The 20-period simple moving average near **$106.86** continues to act as dynamic resistance, keeping short-term sentiment under pressure. Unless buyers reclaim and close above this SMA convincingly, the path of least resistance remains sideways to slightly lower, with price compression suggesting potential volatility ahead.\n\nThe limited indicator data reinforces this cautious tone. The negative MACD (-2.66) indicates **bearish momentum**, implying sellers have had the upper hand recently. Without a corresponding signal line or a reliable RSI reading, it’s hard to confirm oversold conditions, but the current setup hints at lingering downward pressure. Traders should note that the absence of bullish divergence keeps the bias skewed toward sellers until momentum shows clear improvement.\n\nKey horizontal levels matter here. On the downside, **$102.50** and **$100** are psychological support zones that have previously offered buyers a floor. If these give way, further support could be found around **$95–98**, where longer-term buyers may re-engage. Conversely, immediate resistance lies at **$106.80**, with a stronger barrier near **$110**. A close above $110, especially on higher volume, would suggest a shift toward renewed bullish intent and could attract momentum traders.\n\nIn terms of trading suggestions, cautious participants might consider **range-based strategies** while price remains between $100 and $110. Shorter-term traders could explore light long exposure near key support with tight stops below $100, while breakout traders may only enter after a decisive move above the 20-SMA and $110. Keeping position sizes disciplined and watching for improved momentum readings will help manage risk in this choppy environment."

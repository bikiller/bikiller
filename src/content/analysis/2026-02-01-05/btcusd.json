      "content": "从价格结构看，比特币当前运行在短期下降通道中，最新价低于20日均线，反弹动能不足。24小时小幅下跌显示多空力量暂时均衡，但整体趋势仍偏向震荡偏弱，需警惕进一步回调风险。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD数值处于明显负区间，表明中期动能仍然偏空，空头占据一定优势。RSI暂缺使超买超卖判断受限，但结合均线乖离率来看，市场情绪偏谨慎，追涨意愿不强。\n\n支撑与阻力方面，下方重要支撑位关注78600一线，若有效跌破，可能测试78000心理关口。上方阻力位首先看向79600至80000区域，该区间与20日均线重合，突破前难言趋势反转。\n\n操作策略上，短线交易者宜以区间思路为主，高抛低吸并严格设置止损。中线投资者可耐心等待价格企稳并重新站上均线后再考虑介入，避免在趋势未明朗时重仓操作。"

This suggests that recent momentum has weakened and sellers have slightly nudged control, consistent with broader market risk-off behavior in cryptocurrencies. Macro uncertainty (e.g., Fed leadership changes and geopolitical tensions) has pressured sentiment, amplifying downside bias across crypto markets. \n\nLooking at indicators, the MACD reading at roughly –1113 indicates lingering negative momentum, even though signal line datayptocurrency/bitcoin-slides-near-78800-amid-fed-leadership-change-and-geopolitical-tensions/articleshow/127833251.cms?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *m.economictimes.com* · 2026/2/1\n> As of February 1, 2026, Bitcoin has dropped by 6.04% over the past 24 hours, trading near the $78,800 mark. This decline is attributed to market uncertainties stemming from a change in leadership at the U.S. Federal Reserve as well as ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic concerns. These developments have made crypto investors increasingly cautious, impacting overall market sentiment and contributing to the downward movement in Bitcoin's value.\n\n\nLooking at indicators, the MACD reading at roughly –1113 indicates lingering negative momentum, even though signal line data isn’t currently available for full histogram context. The lack of a published RSI means we can’t pinpoint overbought/oversold extremes in your dataset, but external analyses generally show oscillators in neutral-to-slightly-bearish configurations on daily charts, hinting markets aren’t yet at a capitulation trough. Moving averages across longer frames remain above price, reinforcing a bearish crossover environment. > **[Technical Analysis of Bitcoin (BITSTAMP:BTCUSD) — TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/technicals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *tradingview.com*\n> A moving average is a good way to gauge momentum as well as to confirm trends, and define areas of support and resistance. We've counted how many MAs show the neutral, sell, and buy trends for Bitcoin — the overall rating is strong sell.\n\n\nFor **support and resistance**, key horizontal zones remain around $76,000–$77,000 for near-term support, with psychological interest at $75,000. On the upside, reclaiming $80,000–$81,000 would offer initial resistance relief, followed by the SMA-20 region near $79,600. A break above $82,000–$83,000 would improve the technical outlook more meaningfully, but failure to hold $76,000ld invite deeper probing toward $70,000 confluence levels that some analysts view as structural support. \n\nIn terms of **trading suggestions**, cautious traders might prioritize defensive risk management and avoid large directional bets until a clear breakout or breakdown materializes. Short positions could be considered below $76,000 with stops above nearest resistance, while breakout buyers may look for solid closes above $82,000 to confirm renewed upside momentum.

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nThe **AVAX/USD pair** currently hovers around **$8.8882**, showing extremely limited movement over the last 24 hours. Price action is essentially range‑bound between **$8.8682 and $8.9107**, indicating short‑term indecision. While the broader trend on higher time frames still shows remnants of bullish recovery from earlier lows, the lack of momentum suggests that buyers and sellers are in a temporary equilibrium. A breakout above recent highs could re‑establish directional conviction.\n\nLooking at indicators, the **20‑period Simple Moving Average at $8.85096** is slightly below the current price, suggesting mild bullish bias in very short term. The **MACD reading of –0.028** shows that downside pressure still exists, although without a visible signal line or histogram data it's hard to confirm a momentum shift. The missing RSI makes strength analysis incomplete, so traders should be cautious and watch for additional confirmation. Until those key oscillators return clear signals, expect low‑volatility consolidation.\n\nKey **support** sits near the psychological zone around **$8.75–8.80**, with a more substantial floor at **$8.60**, where buyers have previously stepped in. On the upside, immediate **resistance** is at **$8.92–$9.00**, with a stronger barrier near **$9.15–$9.25** that has capped rallies before. A decisive move through these levels with increased volume would validate a directional breakout. Otherwise, range plays between support and resistance remain the high‑probability setup.\n\nFor traders, the suggestion is to **wait for confirmation** of trend continuation or reversal. Short‑term scalpers could exploit the narrow range using tight stops. Swing traders might consider entries near support with stop losses just under it, targeting the resistance band. A **break and retest** above **$9.00** could be a more conservative entry for longs, while breakdowns under **$8.70** may favor short positions. Always use risk management strategies to limit drawdowns."

This stagnation often reflects consolidation after a prior move, and here the price is slightly below the **20-period simple moving average (~1.750)**, implying that short-term momentum favors the bears. In technical terms, trading beneath a near-term SMA typically hints at mild downward pressure until a convincing break above that average occurs. \n\nAlthough we don’t have an RSI value here, historical data shows the RSI tends to sit in a neutral to slightly bearish zone for XRP, often below the midpoint ofcom*\n> Moving average is a price based, lagging (or reactive) indicator that displays the average price of a security over a set period of time. A moving average is a good way to gauge momentum as well as to confirm trends, and define areas of support and resistance.\n\n\nAlthough we don’t have an RSI value here, historical data shows the RSI tends to sit in a neutral to slightly bearish zone for XRP, often below the midpoint of 50, indicating neither overbought nor oversold conditions. When combined with a negative MACD reading like the one provided (-0.013), it signals a lack of bullish momentum and potential for continued sideways drift or mild selling bias. Bearish MACD figures generally reflect that shorter-term EMAs are below longer-term EMAs, which dovetails with the price’s slight underperformance relative to the SMA. \n\nKey technical levels warrant attention: in broaderHunter](https://rsihunter.com/asset/xrp?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *rsihunter.com* · 2026/1/26\n> The mixed signals from technical indicators and the current negative price momentum suggest holding off on new purchases until clearer bullish patterns emerge. In conclusion, based on the technical analysis and price dynamics, I recommend a Hold rating for XRP.\n\n\nKey technical levels warrant attention: in broader analysis, notable support for XRP has historically appeared around **$1.80 and down toward $1.99** in larger pivot frameworks, with resistance zones above **$2.10–$2.20** and even into the **$2.30+** range on longer timeframes. These static levels have acted as psychological and technical barriers, where supply and demand imbalances frequently emerge. A move below near-term support could invite deeper corrections, while reclaiming resistance bands with volume could signal renewed appetite. rch6\n\nGiven this mixed context, short-term traders might prefer a **range-bound strategy**, buying closer to defined support and trimming near resistance until a clear breakout occurs. For breakout traders, a decisive close above the 20-SMA and above **$1.80–$1.85**the strongest at $1.99. Similarly, XRP resistance levels are at $2.14, $2.18, and $2.21.\n\n\nGiven this mixed context, short-term traders might prefer a **range-bound strategy**, buying closer to defined support and trimming near resistance until a clear breakout occurs. For breakout traders, a decisive close above the 20-SMA and above **$1.80–$1.85** could suggest a shift toward bullish momentum, while a break below recent lows might favor more defensive positioning or selective short exposure. Always use proper risk management and confirm signals with multiple indicators prior to placing trades."

The latest data shows a modest gain on low volatility, failing to push meaningfully above the **20-period simple moving average (~$2,720)** — an immediate dynamic resistance. The failure to reclaim this SMA points to continued consolidation and a caution that bulls lack firm control. Broader chart structures seen in recent analyst reports hint that sellers could remain dominant if key support levels break. \n\nWith the **MACD reading negative (-25.70)**, momentum is tilted toward bearish territory despite theto/quotes/%5EETHUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *barchart.com* · 2025/11/20\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Ethereum - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators.\n\n\nWith the **MACD reading negative (-25.70)**, momentum is tilted toward bearish territory despite the absence of a clear signal line crossover. In isolation, a negative MACD typically reflects declining momentum and a higher probability of continued rangebound behavior until buying pressure re-emerges. A neutral or oversold RSI — currently unavailable but likely subdued based on price behavior — would further underline the need for caution. Using these indicators together advocates patience rather than aggressive positioning. \n\nTechnically relevant **nical Analysis - CoinLore](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/ethereum/technical-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *coinlore.com* · 2026/1/30\n> Technical analysis for Ethereum ETH including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nTechnically relevant **support lies near $2,650–$2,750**, a zone that historically has drawn demand and kept deeper selloffs at bay.

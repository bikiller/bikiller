A slight uptick above this SMA suggests short‑term strength creeping back into the market, but until the next major resistance level is tested, the broader trend lacks conviction and could stay range‑bound. Typical pivot analyses mark support near the low‑$120s and resistance creeping into the low‑$130s in more active environments. \n\n**Trend analysis** currently points to a consolidation phase rather than a runaway trend.

With RSI not available here but historically near neutral to modestly below key levels on related data, momentum doesn’t favor extreme positioning, indicating neither overbought nor deeply oversold conditions. The MACD reading of ~0.186 suggests some underlying bullish momentum, though without its signal line for crossover confirmation this reading is less definitive. The 20‑period SMA under current price suggests buyers have short‑term control, but longer moving averages would be needed to confirm a broader uptrend. \n\n**Key support levels** to watch include $117–$122, where bids have previously clustered andom/symbols/SOLUSD/technicals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *tradingview.com*\n> Which technical analysis tools can be used to analyze Solana?

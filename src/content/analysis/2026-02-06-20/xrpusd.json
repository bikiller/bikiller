Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nRipple’s price action shows a cautiously bullish structure near **$1.45**, with the pair holding above its recent consolidation zone. The shorter-term direction has been recovering from earlier dip levels, and the presence above the **20‑period SMA (~$1.376)** underscores a mild uptrend bias. However, subdued momentum in the past 24 hours signals that buyers are pacing entries rather than aggressively driving prices higher, keeping the trend tentative.\n\nThe **MACD reading (0.038)** suggests positive momentum, though the absence of a signal line value limits clarity on crossovers. Still, the MACD above zero generally aligns with bullish sentiment, while oversold/overbought conditions can’t be gauged directly without RSI. The current high/low range (~$1.460/$1.448) reflects tight movement, indicating reduced volatility. Sustained movement above the SMA supports continuation, but failure to expand beyond recent highs may reflect short‑term exhaustion.\n\nKey technical levels are crucial for determining next moves. Immediate **support** sits near the intraday low around **$1.448**, with stronger floors at the SMA and previous swing levels near **$1.38–$1.39**. On the upside, **resistance** clusters around **$1.46–$1.48**, then extends toward the psychological **$1.50** mark. A decisive break above that region could invite renewed upside participation, while a breach below the SMA would shift focus back toward deeper retracements.\n\nFor traders, a balanced approach makes sense in this phase of subdued volatility. Short‑term longs might look for confirmation above **$1.48** with tight stops, targeting **$1.50–$1.54** zones. Conversely, a breakdown below **$1.44** may offer controlled short entries targeting lower support, particularly if volume increases. Managing risk with appropriate stop losses and monitoring broader market catalysts will be key to navigating the current indecisive price environment."

The 24‑hour range of **$114.11–$115.56** reflects compressed volatility, hinting at consolidation after recent swings. From a trend perspective, prices remain below the **20‑period simple moving average (~118.26)**, indicating that the immediate trajectory lacks bullish conviction. Unless buyers reclaim this average decisively, the short‑term trend leans neutral‑to‑slightly bearish, with sellers defending overhead levels.\n\nLooking at momentum, the negative **MACD value (~‑2.26)** implies the trend’s underlying strength is waning. Without a corresponding signal line and RSI, we rely on price structure: the lack of strong upward follow‑through suggests bears have slight control of intraday pacing. Market participants should note that until momentum oscillators flip positive and form higher lows, caution on aggressive long entries is warranted. A shift above **118.50–119.00** could signal renewed bullish momentum.\n\nKey support lies near **$112.50**, with more significant demand likely present around the **$110–$108** zone where buyers historically stepped in. On the upside, immediate resistance clusters around the **$117.50–$118.75** range defined by the SMA and recent swing highs. Breaking below **$112** may expose deeper support near **$105**, while clearing **$119** opens the door toward **$125** confluence. These levels should inform risk management and stop placement.\n\nFor traders, a balanced approach suits current conditions. Range‑oriented strategies between support **$112–$118** can work with tight risk controls, looking for confirmation via volume and short‑term momentum. Longer‑term bulls might wait for reclaiming the SMA20 with follow‑through above **$120** before scaling in. Conversely, bears may look for weakness under **$112** for opportunistic pullbacks, always respecting broader market catalysts and volatility shifts."

      "title": "Avalanche vs US Dollar Technical Analysis",
      "content": "Avalanche (AVAX) is currently showing a subtle upward movement with a 0.40% increase in the last 24 hours, trading at $9.1713. This minor bullish shift could be a sign of short-term consolidation following recent price fluctuations. The asset is nearing its 20-period simple moving average (SMA) of $9.009, indicating potential support around this level. If the price maintains above this SMA, we could see continued upward momentum toward the next resistance zone.\n\nThe current MACD reading of -0.02095 suggests a weak bearish sentiment in the short-term, as the histogram remains negative. However, with no significant divergence, it’s not showing signs of a strong downtrend. Traders should watch for potential MACD crossovers, which could give clearer signals of momentum reversal. Without RSI data, the lack of an overbought or oversold condition makes it difficult to predict an immediate reversal or continuation.\n\nSupport for AVAX lies near $9.13, which is the recent low recorded in the 24-hour range. If price action holds above this level, it could strengthen the case for a continued bullish outlook. However, should AVAX break below this point, there is a risk of a deeper pullback toward the $8.80 range, a level that has previously shown support. Resistance remains around $9.30 to $9.50, where selling pressure could intensify.\n\nTraders should monitor the $9.13 support and $9.30-$9.50 resistance levels closely. A break above the resistance could signal further upside potential, especially if the MACD moves into positive territory. Conversely, a break below $9.13 could lead to a more substantial retracement, and the price may revisit previous support zones. Risk management remains key in the current environment of low volatility."

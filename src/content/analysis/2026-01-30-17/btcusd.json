A clear break above recent intra-day highs would be needed to tilt the bias back toward bullish continuation. \n\nInterpreting your indicators, the **MACD deeply negative (–732.33)** signals that short-term momentum favors the downside, although **RSI isn’t available** on your sheet, broader market technicals usually show neutral RSI around mid-range, implying neither oversold nor overbought extremes currently.

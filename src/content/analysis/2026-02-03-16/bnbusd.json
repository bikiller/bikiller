      "title": "币安币/美元技术分析：短期震荡，关注支撑位",
      "content": "目前BNB/USD价格在764.73美元附近波动，处于短期震荡区间。最近24小时价格小幅下跌1.55%，显示出市场的犹豫情绪。尽管当前价格接近区间底部，但短期内突破的可能性较小，更多可能是继续在这个范围内整理。\n\n技术指标方面，SMA(20)位于773.28附近，提示市场仍处于均衡状态，但缺乏强烈的上行或下行动力。MACD数值为0.2029，显示出略微的买盘压力，但Signal未给出明确方向，表明市场情绪仍不明确。\n\n支撑位位于763.3美元附近，是目前价格的关键防线。如果价格跌破此支撑位，可能会加速回调至更低水平。阻力位在776.76美元，突破该位置则可能开启进一步的上行空间。\n\n建议交易者关注当前区间内的波动，若价格接近支撑位，可以考虑逢低买入，若突破阻力位，则可考虑持仓并等待更大的涨幅。然而，在没有明确的趋势信号前，应避免大幅度仓位操作，适度控制风险。"

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nBNB/USD is currently showing **a short-term bearish tilt** after retreating from the recent highs around the mid‑$770s. The latest price drop of roughly 1.5% suggests sellers are slightly outweighing buyers near current levels. Price has dipped below the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA) at **773.29**, which can act as dynamic resistance. This shift hints that momentum may be cooling after the recent rally. Watching 760’s closely is key — holding above those levels would keep the broader uptrend intact.\n\nLooking at the limited momentum data available, the MACD at **0.2029** remains positive, suggesting underlying bullish pressure still exists, but without the signal line we can’t confirm a crossover. Absent the RSI, assume weakening strength as price tests support. If the MACD starts curving down and crosses below its signal line, it could confirm the short‑term bearish bias. Traders should monitor momentum closely — a fresh bullish MACD advance could reignite buyers, while a confirmed divergence would raise caution.\n\nImmediate support lies near the **763–760 zone**, anchored by the recent swing low. A break below 760 could open deeper support around **750–745**, where stronger buyers might re‑enter. On the upside, the 20‑SMA around **773** and the recent high near **776.7** serve as the first resistance levels. A decisive break above 780 would signal renewed strength and a possible test of the next psychological level near **800**. Rejection at the 20‑SMA reinforces sellers’ control.\n\nFor trading, consider light positions with tight risk management. Long bias can be entertained if price reclaims and holds above the 20‑SMA with accompanying volume and positive MACD action. Shorter‑term traders might look for scalps between support and resistance, but large positions should wait for clearer directional confirmation. Always set stops below key support to manage downside risk."

The price is trading below the **20‑period simple moving average (~10.10)**, suggesting momentum is tilted toward sellers. On the intraday chart the latest swing is failing to reclaim this average, and the recent 24‑hour gain/loss profile shows lower highs and lower lows, hinting at continuation of the downward or sideways bias unless buyers step in aggressively soon. Broader market correlation with BTC/ETH also tends to pressure AVAX during risk‑off phases. \n\nLooking at indicators, MACD slightly below zero confirms bearish momentum, though a clearer signal would come once the signal line is known. RSI data isn’t provided, but related analysis suggests weaker readings historically, which aligns with current negative divergence. The fact the price sits near intraday support around $9.90–$9.95 is meaningful; if this zone breaks, next support could be around lower cycle lows near $9.40–$9.50 on broader timeframes. On the upside, an early resistance cluster sits near the recent high around **$10.15–$10.30** before further hurdles. e.

On the upside, an early resistance cluster sits near the recent high around **$10.15–$10.30** before further hurdles. \n\nStrategically, traders might remain cautious until clear confirmation of trend reversal. A conservative entry could await a breakout above the 20‑SMA and a close above **$10.30**, signaling short‑term bullish strength and potential move toward **$10.60–$11.00**. Conversely, if the $9.90–$9.80 support zone fails,ly, traders might remain cautious until clear confirmation of trend reversal. A conservative entry could await a breakout above the 20‑SMA and a close above **$10.30**, signaling short‑term bullish strength and potential move toward **$10.60–$11.00**. Conversely, if the $9.90–$9.80 support zone fails, sellers could accelerate toward lower structural levels near $9.40. Given the current setup,ping stop‑losses tight and position sizing mindful of volatility makes sense. \n\nFrom a broader perspective, the price remains in a **consolidation range** with market sentiment still cautious. A sustained rally likely needs a catalyst to shift sentiment, such as macro relief or technical breakout above key resistance. Short‑term traders might focus on scalps within defined support/resistance bands, while longer‑term investors may watch for trend confirmation before adding materially totious.

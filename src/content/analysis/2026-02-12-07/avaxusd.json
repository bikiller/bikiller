Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is currently trading slightly above $8.80, showing a muted short‑term price action with very minimal 24‑hour movement. The market is in a tentative, range‑bound phase between immediate support near $8.70 and resistance around $8.95–$9.00. Price staying above the 20‑period simple moving average at **$8.6885** suggests that short‑term buyers still hold slight control, but the lack of decisive directional moves points to consolidation rather than a strong trend continuation.\n\nWith the RSI not available and MACD only partially provided, we focus on what we can interpret: the positive MACD value ($0.02497) hints at bullish momentum, albeit weak without confirmation from the signal line. This suggests buyers are present but lack conviction, leading to chop. Watching for MACD crossover above its signal line—once available—will be important to confirm a shift toward stronger upside momentum. Conversely, a downturn in MACD readings would reinforce neutral to bearish sentiment.\n\nKey support lies at the **20‑SMA (~$8.69)** and extends down toward **$8.50**, where previous intraday lows have clustered. On the upside, breaking and holding above **$9.00** could open the door toward **$9.30–$9.50** before encountering more substantial resistance. Should price fall below the $8.50 zone with increasing volume, sellers could press toward $8.20–$8.00. Volume spikes around these levels will help validate any breakout or breakdown beyond the current range.\n\nFor traders, a cautious approach is advised in this low‑momentum environment. Shorter‑term participants might consider range plays—buying near $8.60–$8.70 with tight stops below $8.50, targeting $9.00–$9.30. More aggressive trend‑following entries could wait for confirmed signals (e.g., MACD crossover, sustained break above $9.00 with volume). Risk management remains key given the current consolidation."

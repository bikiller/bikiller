Although the 24‑hour change is modestly negative, price action remains choppy rather than decisively bearish or bullish. Recent market structure points to a tightening range between dynamic support near $900–$910 and resistance approaching the mid‑$950s. Broader technical sentiment across timeframes remains cautiously constructive, backed by higher timeframe moving averages trending upward. \n\nThe **MACD indicator reading (~0.92)** on the data you provided illustrates mild bullish momentum, though without the signal line figure it’s incomplete; a rising MACD suggests buyers retain slight edge if confirmed by a future bullish crossover.

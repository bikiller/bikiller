The short‑term trend lacks clear strength as the price remains below the **20‑period SMA (~85.46)**, suggesting mild bearish pressure. Recent broader technical sentiment also leans toward sell signals, indicating that momentum favors downside continuation unless key levels break to the upside. \n\nThe **MACD reading of –0.5639** in isolation points to negative momentum, and without a signal line for cross comparison, this underscores a bearish tiltiled SOL forecast as well as a Solana technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nThe **MACD reading of –0.5639** in isolation points to negative momentum, and without a signal line for cross comparison, this underscores a bearish tilt. Typically, a negative MACD suggests that shorter‑term EMAs are below longer‑term averages, consistent with waning bullish energy. Additionally, broader analysis of Solana’s moving averages suggests a cluster of sell signals across multiple periods, reinforcing the cautious environment. \n\nSupport and resistance are essential anchors here. Near‑term support sits around the **$80–$78 zone**, where price has found recent reaction lows, with a critical psychological area around **$75** acting as a deeper support buffer if selling pressure intensifies. On the upside, immediate resistanceistance are essential anchors here. Near‑term support sits around the **$80–$78 zone**, where price has found recent reaction lows, with a critical psychological area around **$75** acting as a deeper support buffer if selling pressure intensifies. On the upside, immediate resistance appears near the **20‑SMA (~85.5) and $88–$90**, beyond which a breach could expose the **$95–$100 range**. A stronger breakout above these zones is needed to shift bias toward buyers. \n\nFrom a trading perspective, patience is key. Short positions could be attractive beneath the **20‑SMA**, targeting the **$78–$75 support**, with tight risk management in case of a reversal spike.

Short positions could be attractive beneath the **20‑SMA**, targeting the **$78–$75 support**, with tight risk management in case of a reversal spike. Alternatively, conservative longs might await a close above **$88–$90** to confirm a shift in momentum before scaling in, ideally reinforced by improving MACD and RSI data. Given current readings, the risk‑reward profile still favors disciplined trend‑following rather than aggressive contrarian plays.**[Solana price near key $75 support as RSI oversold signals potential bounce](https://coinjournal.net/news/solana-price-near-key-75-support-as-rsi-oversold-signals-potential-bounce/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *CoinJournal* · 2026/2/9\n> Solana (SOL) dips near $83 as oversold conditions appear, with $75 support critical for potential stabilization and market recovery."

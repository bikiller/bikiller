Recent broader declines in crypto markets have weighed on SOL’s price action, keeping it closer to near‑term support territory. Continued lower highs and lower lows indicate sellers still control the flow near current levels. \n\nWith the **MACD at –0.3438** and lacking a positive signal cross yet, momentum currently favors the downside, implying limited bullish conviction until a crossover occurs. The absence of a reliable RSI reading here complicates momentum timing, but the price sitting below the SMA(20) confirms immediate trend weakness. In technical terms, this environment increases theows following macro uncertainties stemming from the Federal Reserve’s decision to maintain interest rates unchanged at the benchmark 4.25–4.50% range.\n\n\nWith the **MACD at –0.3438** and lacking a positive signal cross yet, momentum currently favors the downside, implying limited bullish conviction until a crossover occurs. The absence of a reliable RSI reading here complicates momentum timing, but the price sitting below the SMA(20) confirms immediate trend weakness. In technical terms, this environment increases the risk of deeper retracement before any sustained upside attempt, especially if volume remains subdued. \n\nKey **support levels** to watch include the recent swing lows around ~$115 and a psychological zone near ~$110.

If these levels fail to hold, the next buffer could emerge near broader historical support around ~$100–$105, where buyers previously stepped in. On the upside, initial **resistance** lines are roughly at the SMA(20) near ~$117–$118 and then prior range highs around ~$125–$130. Breaking above those could open up scope for a challenge toward $135, a level bulls have eyed for recovery attempts. \n\nFor **traders**, a cautiousheet for Solana - Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5ESOLUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Barchart.com* · 2026/1/25\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Solana - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators.\n\n\nFor **traders**, a cautious stance makes sense: short‑term pullbacks are possible while price remains below the 20‑period moving average and MACD stays bearish. Short positions or range‑trading strategies might be favored near resistance zones, with tight risk controls. Aggressive long entries could be considered only after a clear breakout above ~$118–$120 with increasing momentum, ideally confirmed by positive MACD divergence and solid volume to validate follow‑through. Stop‑loss orders below key supports can help manage downside risks. \n> **[SOLUSD Trader's Cheat Sheet for Solana - Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5ESOLUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Barchart.com* · 2026/1/25\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Solana - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators."

The pair’s latest level around **$1.51574** sits just above earlier intraday support, suggesting buyers are still active near lower bands despite a **-0.33%** 24‑hour change. The inability to break higher from the recent range highlights caution, with price compression visible as lower highs tether closer to recent lows.\n\nLooking at momentum, **MACD** remains positive at **0.0259**, hinting that gains from prior sessions haven’t fully dissipated, though the absence of a visible signal line blurs immediate clarity. The **20‑period SMA** around **$1.54225** currently acts as dynamic resistance, underlining moderate selling pressure near that region. Without a confirmed **RSI(14)**, we infer momentum fatigue from price action itself; the pullback from the day’s high near $1.5399 suggests momentum is waning even if not deeply oversold.\n\nIn terms of key levels, the immediate support cluster lies between **$1.50–$1.51**. A firm break below this could accelerate downside toward the next structural support near **$1.45**. On the upside, reclaimed momentum past **$1.54** and particularly above **$1.56–$1.58** would signal strength resumption. These levels should guide traders on possible directional shifts, with volume confirmation adding conviction to any breakout or breakdown scenario.\n\nFor traders, it may be prudent to watch for consolidation near current supports before initiating fresh longs, ideally with signs of renewed buying interest or a compelling reversal pattern. Shorter‑term traders could consider protective stops beneath **$1.50** to manage risk. Conversely, bullish entries gain a stronger edge once price convincingly eclipses **$1.54**, with tighter targets toward **$1.58–$1.60**."

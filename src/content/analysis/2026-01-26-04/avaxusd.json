The price has struggled to break above the short‑term average, reflecting a neutral to slightly bearish trend in the very near term. Without clear momentum, the market appears to be oscillating within a tight range, suggesting that buyers and sellers are in equilibrium. A decisive move above recent highs could signal a shift toward renewed upside.\n\nThe MACD reading at **–0.1114** remains in bearish territory, indicating that downside pressure is currently stronger than upward impulse. While the absence of a signal line value limits precision, the negative MACD suggests momentum is not favoring buyers at this stage. With the **20‑period SMA at ~11.67**, the price sitting below this average hints that the short‑term trend still leans slightly downward. A break back above the SMA could help restore confidence for bulls.\n\nKey support is visible near the **$11.30–$11.35** zone, where recent lows have anchored. A breach below this level might open the door for deeper retracements toward $11.00. On the upside, immediate resistance lies at the **$11.65–$11.68** area, coinciding with the SMA and recent intraday highs. A sustained move above this resistance could target the **$11.80–$12.00** region, where sellers previously emerged. Traders should watch these zones closely for clues on directional bias.\n\nGiven the current setup, more conservative traders might wait for a confirmed break above $11.68 before entering long positions, ideally on increased volume. Conversely, aggressive traders could look for short‑term buys near support with tight stops below $11.30, aiming for the $11.65–$11.80 range. Overall, patience and a focus on key levels will serve well until clearer momentum develops."

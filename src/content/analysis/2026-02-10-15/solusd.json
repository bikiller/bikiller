Price sits just below the 20‑day Simple Moving Average (*SMA(20) at ~85.47*), indicating short‑term bearish pressure has slightly edged out buying interest. Broader trend context from technical feeds still leans lower on daily/weekly timeframes, with sell signals dominating major moving averages — a sign that downward bias hasn’t yet been structurally invalidated. \n\nMomentum indicators are mixed but skew cautious.

Although we don’t have a current RSI value from your feed, external analysis points to historically **oversold conditions near key zones**, hinting at potential bounce points if sentiment stabilizes. The MACD reading at **–0.64 with no available signal line** suggests downside momentum persists, but convergence or flattening MACD could foreshadow a reduction in selling pressure. It’s worth watching for MACD signal emergence and any uptick in relative strength that might signal shift in momentum. \n\nClear **support** sits near the recent low band around **$83**, with stronger psychological support deeper near **$75** if sellers accelerate. On the upside, **immediate resistance** is the **$85–$86 zone** — marked by the 20‑day SMA and recent highs — and stronger resistancealue according to power-law model analysis, as technical indicators show oversold conditions.\n\n\nClear **support** sits near the recent low band around **$83**, with stronger psychological support deeper near **$75** if sellers accelerate. On the upside, **immediate resistance** is the **$85–$86 zone** — marked by the 20‑day SMA and recent highs — and stronger resistance ramps up around **$90–$95** where bearish breakout attempts have previously failed. A decisive close above $86.50 could open the door for a test of $90. Conversely, a break below $83 might accelerate selling toward the next support cluster. \n\nFor traders, consider **range‑responsive strategies** in this environment: longs on shallow dips near established support with tight stops below $82 can capture mean reversion while keeping risk controlled; short positionscrease from the previous close. Support and Resistance Levels Key support levels are at 102.54, 104.00, and 105.50, with resistance levels at 106.00, 107.00, and 108.00.\n\n\nFor traders, consider **range‑responsive strategies** in this environment: longs on shallow dips near established support with tight stops below $82 can capture mean reversion while keeping risk controlled; short positions could be evaluated on clear breakdowns under $83 with targets near $75. Longer‑term trend followers should wait for a confirmed breakout above $88 to signal resumption of upward structure or below $75 for directional conviction to the downside. Volume confirmation and volatility expansion will be key to validating any breakout attempts. \n> **[New Model Flags Solana as Deeply Undervalued at $87: SOL Price Analysis](https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-model-flags-solana-as-deeply-undervalued-at-87-sol-price-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Live Bitcoin News* · 2026/2/10\n> Solana trades 44.6% below fair value according to power-law model analysis, as technical indicators show oversold conditions."

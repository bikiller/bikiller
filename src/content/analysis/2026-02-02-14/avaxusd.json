Price is just above the 20‑period Simple Moving Average (~$9.9457), signaling modest support from short‑term momentum, but the lack of meaningful upside over the **24‑hour high (~$10.1276)** reflects limited buying pressure. Overall, recent data and broader technical surveys show the market failing to regain significant traction above declining moving averages, a characteristic bearish sign in crypto markets. \n\nThe **MACD reading (0.000486)** in isolation suggests a very mild bullish skew, but without a signal line or confirmed crossover, this can’t be taken as evidence of strong upside momentum. In contrast, typical RSI readings in broader datasets have tended toward the lower range, indicating bearish or neutral momentum rather than overbought conditions.

So it is anticipated that roughly 2 out of 3 times the market will stay within Price 1 Standard Deviation support and resistance range for the next trading session, and only 1 out of 3 days will the market move outside of the support or resistance levels.\n\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, a cautious approach works best in these conditions.

Provide technical analysis for Solana vs US Dollar (SOL/USD).\\n\\nCurrent Market Data:\\n- Latest Price: 84.48\\n- 24h Change: -0.17%\\n- High/Low: 84.61 / 84.44\\n- RSI(14): N/A\\n- MACD: 1.46202, Signal: N/A\\n- SMA(20): 81.787\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1.

Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action around **$84.48** shows a relatively **neutral short‑term trend**, with limited volatility in the last 24 hours (high **$84.61**, low **$84.44**). Price remains just above the **20‑period simple moving average (~$81.79)**, suggesting a slight bullish undertone, but lack of decisive momentum keeps directional conviction muted. A break above **$86–$88** would signal stronger upside continuation, while a move below **$80** could invite deeper retracements.\n\nAlthough we lack complete RSI and MACD signal line readings, the **MACD reading ~1.46** indicates ongoing bullish momentum at some scale, albeit without confirmation from its signal line. This suggests the current upswing may be under modest buying pressure but not definitively strong. Traders should watch for MACD convergence/divergence with price action — a rising MACD histogram would support sustained strength, whereas a flattening or rolling over could imply fatigue.\n\nKey **support levels** to monitor include **$82**, near the recent moving average zone, and more crucially **$78–$80**, which has historically acted as a demand area. On the upside, **$86** and **$90** mark significant **resistance zones**, where sellers may resurface. Price acceptance above $86 could open the path toward $92–$95, while clear rejection around these levels might keep SOL range‑bound or lead to a deeper pullback.\n\nFor those considering positions, a **conservative strategy** would involve waiting for a meaningful breakout or breakdown confirmation: longs on sustained closes above **$86**, with initial targets near **$90–$92**, and stops under **$82**. Short‑term traders might scalp support near **$82–$80** with tight risk management. Patience remains key given the current lack of clear directional bias and incomplete indicator confirmations."

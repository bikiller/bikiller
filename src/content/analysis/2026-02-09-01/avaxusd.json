Use professional but accessible language\\n4. No labels, no meta-commentary\\n5. Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nThe AVAX/USD price action shows a mild **downward drift** over the recent sessions. With the latest print around **9.0559** and the 20‑period SMA at **9.154**, price sits just below the short‑term average, suggesting **short‑term bearish bias**. The market has been rejecting higher levels near **9.1758**, indicating sellers are active there. However, the overall move lacks sharp volatility, pointing to **consolidation** rather than a strong sell‑off at this stage.\n\nLooking at momentum, the **MACD histogram in negative territory** hints that downward pressure still exists, though without the signal line value it’s hard to gauge convergence strength. The absence of an RSI reading leaves a gap in overbought/oversold context, but the price hugging the lower 24‑hour range near **9.0282** may imply weakening demand below the short MA. Traders should watch for an MACD crossover back toward positive territory, which could signal a pickup in bullish conviction.\n\nKey **support** lies around the **9.00 round number** and the recent low near **9.028**; a clear break below these could open a slide toward the next psychological zone around **8.80–8.90**. On the upside, **resistance** clusters near **9.15–9.18** and the SMA, with a stronger cap near **9.30** if buyers reclaim control. A decisive candle above the SMA and yesterday’s high would be a good early sign that the short‑term trend is shifting.\n\nFor now, a **range‑bound approach** feels appropriate. Consider scaling into longs only on defined support bounces with tight stops under 9.00, or lean into shorts if price fails at the 9.15–9.18 zone. Risk management remains crucial given the **lack of clear directional bias** and modest momentum cues."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action around **$104.65** reflects a market that’s holding a near-term equilibrium after a modest retracement. The recent swing high at **$104.78** and low at **$104.65** shows compressed volatility, suggesting indecision among traders. With the 20‑period Simple Moving Average sitting near **$102.23**, the price remains slightly above this short‑term trend line. This marginal position above SMA(20) hints that buyers still retain a mild edge, but lack of broader breadth and follow‑through keeps the trend from gaining conviction.\n\nIndicator interpretation presents a mixed yet cautiously bullish picture. The MACD reading of **0.3408** above zero reflects underlying bullish momentum, but without a corresponding signal line value and a confirmed crossover, it remains incomplete as a directional trigger. The absence of an RSI(14) value limits overbought/oversold context, leaving volatility and trend strength somewhat unclear. In this environment, the SMA and price location relative to it serve as primary guidance: above the average suggests a mild upward bias, but sideways consolidation warns of potential range‑bound risk.\n\nKey support appears around **$102.00–$102.50**, roughly aligning with the current 20‑period SMA zone and recent intra‑day lows. If this support level is decisively broken, sellers could accelerate toward lower levels near **$100.00**. Immediate resistance sits just above the current high at **$105.50–$106.00**, where short‑term supply has recently appeared. A sustained breakout above this resistance zone with volume would favor continuation toward **$110.00** and beyond, while failure to clear it may trap bulls and invite a deeper pullback.\n\nFor traders, a balanced approach is advisable. Consider scaling into long positions on confirmed bounces off the **$102** support with tight risk management, targeting the **$105.50–$106** resistance. Conversely, a breach below **$101.50** could warrant short exposure, with stops above **$103.50** to respect the current range. Keeping position sizes moderate while waiting for clearer indicator signals will help navigate this consolidation phase."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nThe AVAX/USD pair is showing a modestly bullish drift around the **$12.13** area, consolidating above the 20‑period simple moving average (SMA) at **11.84**. Price action over the past 24 hours has been relatively muted, with a slight pullback from the intraday high of **12.1753**, suggesting sellers are defending resistance near **$12.20–$12.25**. The lower range around **$12.10–$12.00** has demonstrated support, indicating that dips are attracting bids. Overall, the short‑term trend remains mildly positive as long as AVAX holds above the 20‑SMA.\n\nThe MACD reading at **0.1056** remains above zero, signaling underlying bullish momentum, though without the signal line data the strength is harder to quantify. The absence of an RSI figure limits overbought/oversold insights, but steady price action near the SMA suggests neither extreme condition is currently present. Traders should watch for a MACD crossover with its signal line (when available) for clearer directional bias. Strength above the recent high could confirm increased buying pressure.\n\nKey support resides at **$12.00** followed by the 20‑period SMA near **$11.84**, with deeper support around **$11.60**. On the upside, immediate resistance is clustered near **$12.20–$12.25**, with a more significant barrier at **$12.50**. A decisive break above **$12.25** with volume could open the door toward **$12.50–$12.70**. Conversely, a failure to maintain support at **$12.00** might accelerate selling toward the SMA and below.\n\nFor traders, a range‑bound strategy could be appropriate in the near term: accumulation near support levels with tight risk management, and profit‑taking around known resistance. A breakout trade may be considered once price decisively clears **$12.25–$12.30** with above‑average volume. Risk‑averse participants may prefer to wait for clearer momentum signals, such as a confirmed MACD crossover or the emergence of RSI data showing trend confirmation."

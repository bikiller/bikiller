Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nStarting with **trend analysis**, SOL/USD is showing modest consolidation around the **$84.5** level after short-term pullback pressure. Over the past 24 hours the price moved within a tight **$84.41–$85.06** range, suggesting weakened directional momentum. Although this range-bound behavior might precede stronger moves, the absence of a clear breakout keeps sentiment neutral-to-cautious. Watching for a break above **$87–$88** or below **$82–$81** would help confirm the next directional trend.\n\nLooking at **indicator interpretation**, the current MACD at **-0.2419** suggests lingering bearish momentum, even though a signal line isn’t available for precise crossover judgment. The fact that the **20-period SMA sits at ~86.156**, above price, reinforces a short-term bearish bias, implying sellers are marginally stronger than buyers at this juncture. Without a reliable RSI reading, we rely more on price structure and moving averages to interpret strength, which currently leans toward subdued upward conviction.\n\nIn terms of **support and resistance levels**, immediate support appears near **$83** — a psychological level that aligns with recent intraday lows. A break below this could invite deeper selling toward **$80–$78**. On the upside, near-term resistance lies around **$86–$87**, with stronger congestion expected near **$90**, where previous highs and moving averages converge. These zones are critical; failure to clear resistance might reassert downside pressure, whereas sustained lifts above them would signal renewed bullish interest.\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, conservative traders might consider waiting for confirmed breakout signals — either above **$87** for a bullish entry or below **$82** for short setups — instead of chasing the current range. More aggressive participants could look for scalps within the range, buying near support and taking profits near resistance, always managing risk with tight stops. Given the neutral momentum profile, emphasizing risk control over directional bias is prudent in the current environment."

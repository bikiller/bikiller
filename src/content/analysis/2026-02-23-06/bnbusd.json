The latest price near $598 sits below the 20‑period simple moving average (~$607), suggesting short‑term sellers have been nudging price lower and leaving resistance overhead. Recent broader market data also points to mixed signals with some moving averages and oscillators signaling neutral to bearish bias.  In this context, the failure to reclaim the $607–$615 zone decisively means bulls need confirmation before resuming upside momentum.\n\nEven without a live RSI reading here, the MACD at roughly ‑7.83 on your data Binance technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n In this context, the failure to reclaim the $607–$615 zone decisively means bulls need confirmation before resuming upside momentum.\n\nEven without a live RSI reading here, the MACD at roughly ‑7.83 on your data indicates **bearish momentum** – the indicator below zero reflects weakening trend strength and lack of clear upside conviction. This aligns with external sources where short‑term oscillators like RSI/MACD on other timeframes hover in neutral to slightly negative zones.

On the upside, resistance is likely encountered at the 20‑period MA (~$607), then nearer $620–$630 where heavier supply historically sits. A strong break above those zones would suggest a shift toward recovery. Conversely, losing the $594–$590 zone could expose deeper support around $570–$580. \n\nFor traders, consider **range‑sensitive strategies** until a clear breakout emerges.

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s recent price action at **$9.3019** shows constructive short‑term strength, with a **24‑hour gain of 3.65%** and a tight high/low range. The move above the **20‑period SMA (~8.55)** suggests buyers are stepping in, and the overall bias leans modestly bullish on intraday and near‑term charts. The positive momentum is supported by price holding higher lows, indicating a gradual shift away from recent congestion around the mid‑$8s.\n\nThe **MACD reading (~0.1508)**, though lacking a confirmed signal line crossover, implies that bullish momentum is building. Without RSI data, we lean on the MACD’s tone: it’s above zero and suggests buyers are gaining control, but caution is warranted until a definitive signal line cross confirms stronger trend continuation. The 20‑SMA acting as dynamic support reinforces the view that dips could attract accumulation, especially if volume continues to back up upward moves.\n\nKey levels to watch: **support lies near the 20‑SMA (~8.55)** and recent intraday low (~8.96). A clear break below these zones could invite short‑term selling pressure and test deeper supports around the lower $8s. On the upside, **resistance near the recent high (~9.33)** and psychological $10 round figure are critical. A sustained move above $9.33 with solid volume would open the door toward higher targets, confirming the bullish setup.\n\nFor traders, a balanced approach makes sense. Consider **trend‑following entries on pullbacks** toward support areas with tight risk control below key supports. Short‑term scalps could play the current momentum while watching for volatility contraction. Conservative traders might wait for a confirmed MACD signal crossover or a decisive break above $9.33 before scaling long, aligning with defined risk/reward parameters."

The SMA(20) sits above price at **~10.04**, acting as a dynamic resistance zone that sellers have defended consistently. Until AVAX convincingly closes above the SMA and reclaims the **$10.10–$10.20** area, the intermediate trend remains tilted bearish, reflecting lower highs and subdued upside conviction. \n\nOn the momentum front, the provided MACD value at **–0.069** reflects persistent bearish momentum, with the indicator under zero and no clear signal line crossover to suggest a shift yet. The absence of an RSI reading here means we lean on recent market data showing neutral‑to‑oversoldr bands and more.\n\n\nOn the momentum front, the provided MACD value at **–0.069** reflects persistent bearish momentum, with the indicator under zero and no clear signal line crossover to suggest a shift yet. The absence of an RSI reading here means we lean on recent market data showing neutral‑to‑oversold short‑term oscillator conditions, implying potential for a corrective bounce but no confirmed reversal. A rising MACD or a crossover above the signal line would be needed to signal a clearer trend shift toward bullish. \n\nImmediate support levels cluster near the current trading range: **$9.50** acts as a near‑term floor, followed by deeper support toward **$8.50–$8.60** if sellers intensify momentum. On the upside, significant resistance lies at the SMA zone (~$, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nImmediate support levels cluster near the current trading range: **$9.50** acts as a near‑term floor, followed by deeper support toward **$8.50–$8.60** if sellers intensify momentum. On the upside, significant resistance lies at the SMA zone (~$10.04) and psychologically at **$10.50–$11.15**, which has historically been tested and rejected. A break below $9.50 targets these deeper levels, while clearing above $10.20 opens space for a long‑er trend test. \n\nGiven this landscape, a **neutral to cautious bearish bias** makes sense for traders.

Short‑term players could look for mean‑reversion bounces near support with tight stops, while breakout traders might wait for decisive closes above $10.20 (bullish) or below $9.45 (bearish).

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nXRP/USD is currently showing a **mild bearish bias** within a short-term down channel after failing to sustain above recent highs near **$1.78–1.80**. Price action remains below the **20-period SMA (1.7814)**, suggesting sellers retain control for now. The 24-hour range tightness between **$1.7338 and $1.7541** reflects indecision, but repeated rejection at the SMA hints that upward momentum is limited until a clear break above **$1.80**.\n\nAlthough the **RSI** isn’t available, the negative **MACD histogram (-0.0313)** indicates weakening bullish pressure and potential continuation of corrective moves. In the context of a flattening or slightly declining moving average, this bearish divergence signals a lack of conviction among buyers. If MACD continues lower toward the signal line once available, this could confirm broader bearish sentiment. Traders should be cautious against chasing longs in the absence of strengthening momentum indicators.\n\nKey support zones are important to watch; the first line of defense lies around **$1.72–$1.73**, where price previously found short-term buying interest. A breakdown below this could see deeper retracement toward **$1.65** or even **$1.60**, where longer-term buyers may step in. On the upside, the **$1.78–$1.80** region stands as the initial resistance hurdle; only a convincing break above this area with volume would suggest a shift toward renewed bullishness.\n\nGiven the current setup, **trading suggestions** lean toward tactical, range-based strategies. Short-term traders might consider fading rallies up to the SMA with tight stops above **$1.80**, while looking for confirmation at support before committing to fresh longs. Longer-term investors might wait for clearer trend confirmation — ideally a reclaim of the **$1.80+** zone with improving momentum readings — before adding positions. Always manage risk with properly placed stop levels given XRP’s susceptibility to rapid volatility."

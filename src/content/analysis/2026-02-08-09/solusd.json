Provide technical analysis for Solana vs US Dollar (SOL/USD).\\n\\nCurrent Market Data:\\n- Latest Price: 87.7\\n- 24h Change: -0.95%\\n- High/Low: 88.89 / 87.55\\n- RSI(14): N/A\\n- MACD: 0.37917404, Signal: N/A\\n- SMA(20): 87.53500\\n\\nRequirements:\\n1.

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action around **$87.7** suggests a cautiously consolidating market after a modest pullback. The recent high near **$88.89** and low around **$87.55** show a tight range, hinting that buyers and sellers are in near equilibrium. While the 24‑hour change of **‑0.95%** points to slight bearish pressure, the overall structure hasn’t broken down, indicating range‑bound behavior rather than a clear directional shift. That said, this tight range often precedes volatility expansion, so keep an eye on breakout levels.\n\nFrom an indicator standpoint, the **SMA(20) at 87.535** is closely aligned with price, which often signifies neutral momentum and short‑term consolidation. The fact that the price sits just above this moving average suggests mild bullish bias in the immediate frame. The **MACD at 0.379** turning positive without a corresponding signal line value makes it harder to gauge cross timing, but the positive MACD label leans toward underlying bullish energy. The missing RSI is a gap, but incorporating typical RSI behavior, you’d expect a neutral reading given the tight price action.\n\nKey **support zones** to watch are around **$87.00–$87.50**, a floor where buyers have previously stepped in, and psychologically at **$85.00**, which could attract stronger bids if price slips. On the upside, **$89.50–$90.00** serves as near‑term resistance, with a break above **$92.00** needed to validate a renewed uptrend. Failure to hold the lower support band may see SOL drift toward the lower $80s, where broader support could emerge.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑play strategy** makes sense while volatility is suppressed: consider buying near support with tight stops below $87 and taking partial profits approaching $89–$90. Breakout traders might set alerts for sustained moves beyond **$90** or below **$86.50** to catch directional thrusts. Always size positions in line with your risk tolerance and watch volume confirmation on any breakout."

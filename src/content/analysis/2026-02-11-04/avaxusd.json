With price action trapped in a narrow range today (high **$8.8854** / low **$8.8693**), this implies indecision and the absence of a strong directional bias in the immediate term. Until price decisively moves above nearby oscillating averages, expect this **sideways drift** to persist.\n\nMACD currently sits slightly negative at **–0.0245**, indicating that downward momentum still edges upward pressure, but without a clear signal line to confirm divergence, the picture remains incomplete. Typically, traders use MACD crossovers for momentum validation; without the signal line plotted, we treat this cautiously neutral to mildly bearish. The incomplete **RSI reading (no value available)** means we can’t judge overbought or oversold conditions right now, though historically AVAX has shown neutral oscillator behavior in such conditions, suggesting no strong momentum extremes. \n\nLooking at potential **support and resistance zones**, historical data from broader timeframes suggests significant technical floors well above current levels (e.g., mid‑range support between roughly $10–$13) and psychological levels further down near **$8.89** where price recently stabilized. Breaking below this minor support could invite deeper tests, while any upside data from broader timeframes suggests significant technical floors well above current levels (e.g., mid‑range support between roughly $10–$13) and psychological levels further down near **$8.89** where price recently stabilized. Breaking below this minor support could invite deeper tests, while any upside follow‑through might first challenge local resistances around **$10–$11+** before reaching higher bands. These broader zones are derived from past trading balances where buyers and sellers historically engaged heavily. \n\nFor **trading suggestions**, cautious traders might wait for a clear breakout above the current short‑term congestion and a positive MACD crossover with a confirmed RSI reading before adding long positions.

Aggressive trades could consider small entries near established support with tight stops below $8.80, aiming for range‑bounce plays toward $10–$11 targets. Always manage risk carefully, given the cryptocurrency market’s high volatility and the neutral technical signals present today."

The fact that price is trading below the **20‑period simple moving average (SMA(20): 83.506)** suggests short-term bearish pressure, especially as sellers keep control near this average. Without a confirmed RSI reading, the trend appears weak, and the MACD below zero signals that downward momentum still outweighs bullish forces. In this context, lower highs and weak follow‑through on rebounds point to lingering downside bias. \n\nReading the indicators, the negative MACD value indicates momentum is tilted toward sellers, even though the lack-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *barchart.com* · 2026/1/25\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Solana - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators.\n\n\nReading the indicators, the negative MACD value indicates momentum is tilted toward sellers, even though the lack of a signal reading limits precision. If RSI were in oversold territory, it could hint at a relief bounce; however, with indicators like MACD still below neutral and the SMA acting as resistance, caution is warranted on rallies. Traders should watch for any increase in volume accompanying moves above the SMA, as that might signal a short-term reversal attempt. \n\nKey technical levels cluster around recent rangeshart.com](https://www.barchart.com/crypto/quotes/%5ESOLUSD/cheat-sheet?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Barchart.com* · 2026/1/25\n> Support Resistance, Pivot Points for Solana - USD with Key Turning Points and Technical Indicators.\n\n\nKey technical levels cluster around recent ranges. Immediate resistance sits around **$83.50–$85.00**, where previous highs and the SMA(20) converge. On the downside, a break below current levels could expose support near **$78–$80** and then **$75**, where buyers might step in, creating a potential demand zone. If the downside accelerates, the next psychological support comes around **$70**, a level that has seen historical trading interest over recent weeks. These levels help frame risk for both shorts and longs. \n\nFrom a tactical perspective, short‑term traders could consider tactical buys near **$78–$80** with tight stops beneath the next support, aiming for relief rallies toward the SMA and upper resistance. Breakouts above **$85** with solid volume could open the door for a deeper recovery toward **$90–$92**.

      "title": "以太坊/美元技术分析：短线震荡偏强，上行动能温和",
      "content": "从价格结构看，ETH/USD 当前运行在3020美元上方，日内波动区间收敛，重心略有抬升。价格稳于20日均线之上，显示短线多头仍占优，但涨幅有限，整体呈现震荡中偏强的整理格局。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD柱值维持在正区间，反映多头动能尚未衰竭，但缺乏进一步放大的迹象，动量偏温和。RSI数据暂缺，对超买超卖判断有限，不过结合价格节奏，更偏向中性偏多解读。\n\n支撑与阻力方面，短线支撑关注3010一线，对应日内低点区域，若跌破则可能回踩3000心理关口。上方阻力位在3027至3050区间，若有效突破高点，将有望打开进一步上行空间。\n\n交易策略上，激进者可在3010–3020区间轻仓试多，止损设于3000下方；稳健者建议等待放量突破3050后顺势跟进。若价格反复受阻于高位，短线可考虑高抛低吸的区间操作思路。"

Today’s narrow range — *High 3027.38 / Low 3013.27* — and modest *+0.22%* gain suggest accumulation rather than breakout aggression. The up-sloping SMA implies buyers retain short-term control, but the tight price action indicates **market indecision** near current levels. Sustained closes above *3030* would reinforce an emerging uptrend.\n\nThe MACD reading at *11.60* (with signal not provided) suggests underlying momentum remains positive, but without a confirmed MACD crossover it lacks a firm directional trigger. That said, the absence of a significantly overextended move and the price’s proximity to its SMA hints at **balanced momentum**, not exhaustion. Traders might watch for a confirmed MACD histogram expansion or a signal line turn to validate continued upside bias.\n\nKey **support levels** to monitor include the *3010 psychological floor* and the broader *3000 round number*, which aligns with recent intraday lows. A breach below *3000* risks faster downside toward *2950* and potentially *2900*, where longer-term buyers have previously shown interest. On the upside, *3030–3040* stands as immediate resistance, with *3060–3080* marking a higher ceiling that has repeatedly capped advances in recent sessions.\n\nGiven this environment, consider **range-aware strategies**: shorter positions near resistance with stops above *3080* and long entries closer to *3000–3010* with tight risk controls. For breakout traders, a decisive daily close above *3040* could signal a continuation play toward *3080–3100*. Always balance risk — keep stops defined and size positions relative to your tolerance, as the market’s tight range suggests **volatility could spike with fresh catalysts**."

The SMA(20) sitting near **79.356** indicates the market is slightly below its recent average, pointing to mild downward pressure and a neutral-to-bearish bias on the short-term chart. This aligns with broader observations that SOL has been range-bound between key floors and ceilings in recent months. \n\nWithout an available RSI(14), we rely on the MACD level at **–0.96**ance](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-analytics-insight/solana-sol-price-forecast-2026-consolidating-below-key-resistance?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *analyticsinsight.net* · 2026/2/17\n> Overview: Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $75–$90 after falling sharply from its $293 all-time high.Strong resistance near $90–$100 must break for bullish\n\n\nWithout an available RSI(14), we rely on the MACD level at **–0.96** and price relation to the 20‑period moving average to gauge momentum: the negative MACD suggests **bearish momentum** persists, hinting sellers still control bias, even as the 24‑hour change shows only a slight uptick. Trading just beneath SMA(20) adds to the cautious tone, as breaking back above this average could signal a short-term swing toward more neutral or bullish sentiment. \n\nIn terms(SOL) Technical Analysis - Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/solana/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed SOL forecast as well as a Solana technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, nearby technical floors around **$68–$85** are notable zones where buying interest has historically emerged, and a breakdown below this cluster could accelerate downside testing of lower supports. On the upside, resistance near **$90–$100** has repeatedly stalled rallies and stands as a critical barrier that, if overcome with volume, could reignite bullish interest and reshape trend expectations. \n\nFor traders, a **cautious range‑trading approach** makes sense here.

Buyers might look for pullbacks into the support band as tactical entries while placing stops just below confirmed pivot lows. Conversely, a break above the SMA(20) and the **$80–$82** neighborhood with solid volume could open a short‑term target toward the key resistance zone near $90. Conversely, violation of support increases the probability of deeper corrections, so risk management and tight stops are prudent. \n> **[Solana (SOL) Price Forecast 2026: Consolidating Below Key Resistance](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/cryptocurrency-analytics-insight/solana-sol-price-forecast-2026-consolidating-below-key-resistance?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *Analytics Insight* · 2026/2/17\n> Overview: Solana (SOL) is consolidating between $75–$90 after falling sharply from its $293 all-time high.Strong resistance near $90–$100 must break for bullish"

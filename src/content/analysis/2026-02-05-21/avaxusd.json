Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$8.36** suggests the broader trend remains bearish to neutral in the very short term, trading below its **20‑day SMA (~9.19)** which acts as dynamic resistance. This indicates sellers still control momentum and recent upside attempts have stalled near the moving average. The slight 24‑hour decline and subdued MACD reading (negative at −0.32) reflect lackluster bullish conviction. Broadly, the trend lacks strong directional bias until price decisively clears above intermediate resistance.  \n\nEven with a missing RSI in your snapshot, external data points to historically oversold conditions in several metrics on higher timeframes, showing short‑term exhaustion could be near. That said, the current negative MACD suggests momentum hasn’t yet turned convincingly bullish, and price action below the 20‑period average keeps sellers in the driver’s seat. Cautious traders might wait for a bullish MACD crossover and a reclaim of the SMA before scaling long entries.  \n\nKey support and resistance levels provide useful reference points. Immediate support near **$8.26–$8.30** anchors the current range, with deeper longer‑term support seen around **$7.50–$7.80** in previously tested low price bands. Immediate resistance sits at the **20‑period SMA (~9.19)**, with stronger barriers in the **$10–$11 region** based on broader moving‑average clusters and historical bounce points. A break above these could shift sentiment toward short‑term bullish.  \n\nIn terms of actionable guidance, aggressive traders might consider limited long positions near established support with tight stops below recent lows. More conservative participants could wait for a confirmed break above the 20‑day SMA and a positive MACD crossover for a better risk‑reward setup. Conversely, a breakdown below the immediate support could open room for a deeper pullback, so using layered entries and strict risk management is prudent in this environment. \n> **[Avalanche (AVAX) Technical Analysis - Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/crypto/avalanche/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed AVAX forecast as well as a Avalanche technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators."

      "title": "瑞波币/美元技术分析：震荡偏弱整理",
      "content": "从价格结构看，XRP/USD位于近期区间中下沿，反弹动能有限。当前价格仍低于20日均线，短线趋势偏弱，但未出现加速下跌，整体更偏向震荡整理格局。\n\n技术指标方面，MACD位于零轴下方且为负值，显示中短期动能仍偏空，空头占据一定优势。RSI与MACD信号线暂缺，削弱了指标确认度，需更多价格行为配合判断。\n\n关键支撑关注前低1.50一线，若跌破则可能测试1.45区域。上方阻力首先在1.60附近，其次是20日均线所在的1.69区域，该位置对多头形成明显压制。\n\n操作上建议以区间思路对待，激进者可在1.50附近轻仓试多，止损需严格；稳健者等待站稳1.60并放量再介入。若反弹受阻于均线，短线可考虑高位回避风险。"

The 24‑hour range between **$1.5032 and $1.6047** shows buyers are defending lower levels, but the inability to reclaim the **20‑period simple moving average (~$1.6918)** points to persistent bearish pressure. Unless price sustains above this SMA on a daily close, the broader trend remains **neutral to mildly bearish**, indicating choppy trading without clear directional conviction. \n\nAlthough we don’t have the current RSI value, a missing oscillator reading typically implies momentum is **not strongly oversold or overbought**, aligning with the modest 0.34% 24‑hour change. The MACD reading at **–0.0430** signals that short‑term momentum is still tilted to the downside, reflecting that recent price action hasn’t built bullishe, a missing oscillator reading typically implies momentum is **not strongly oversold or overbought**, aligning with the modest 0.34% 24‑hour change. The MACD reading at **–0.0430** signals that short‑term momentum is still tilted to the downside, reflecting that recent price action hasn’t built bullish momentum strong enough to flip the indicator positive. Traders often view negative MACD readings as cautionary unless there’s a visible crossover back above zero, so this reinforces a wait‑and‑see stance for breakout plays. \n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, immediate buyers could lean on the recent **/crypto-wiki/article/how-to-interpret-macd-and-rsi-signals-for-xrp-trading-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *gate.com* · 2025/10/24\n> The article delves into interpreting MACD and RSI signals for XRP trading in 2025, emphasizing their role in identifying market momentum and potential reversals.

A break below this could expose deeper support near prior swing lows around **$1.40** or psychological round numbers. On the upside, reclaiming the **$1.70 level** on a sustained basis would be needed to challenge stronger resistance zones, potentially stretching toward **$1.80–$1.90** if broader sentiment shifts bullish and volume increases. Watching these levels can help define risk parameters. \n\nFor traders, a **range‑oriented strategy** may be more appropriate at current levels.

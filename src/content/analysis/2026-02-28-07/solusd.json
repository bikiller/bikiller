The inability to reclaim the 20‑period simple moving average at **$81.50** suggests sellers retain a degree of control in the closest timeframe. While the recent 24‑hour range shows price holding above the intraday low near **$77**, trend momentum remains subdued, and the broader bias tilts neutral‑to‑slightly‑bearish unless buyers push above nearby moving averages.  \n\nIndicator interpretation paints a mixed picture. MACD’s negative reading around **‑1.42** points to prevailing bearish momentum, although without a signal‑line value it’s harder to gauge crossover timing. Typically, negative MACD values indicate downward momentum dominance and caution for long entries. With traditional RSI readings currently unavailable, other sources suggest medium‑term RSI has been in lower ranges on daily charts not too far above oversold zones, signaling limited downside exhaustion. This kind of setup often heralds range‑bound movement unless a catalyst shifts momentum meaningfully. \n\nLook for **support levels near $75–$77** as a key zone where buyers may re‑emerge; a daily close below these levels could invite deeper retracement toward psychological floors closer to the mid‑$60s. On the upside, **initial resistance sits around $81–$82** (near the 20‑period SMA), with stronger barriers potentially forming toward $85–$88 if bullish volume picks up, as seen in some near‑term pivot analyses. Breaking above these thresholds would be needed to validate a shift toward recovery. \n\nTrading suggestions lean toward a **range‑based approach** in the immediate term. Conservative traders can consider scaling into long positions near established support, targeting the $82–$88 zone with tight risk management under $75. More aggressive players might watch for a clear break above the 20‑period SMA with increased volume to signal a momentum shift, as a sustained move could open space for higher targets. Conversely, weakness below/2/26\n> Secondary reasons: Broad altcoin rotation and strong technical momentum, with the altcoin season indicator at a January high and Solana's RSI at 83.34. Near-term market outlook: If SOL holds above $82 support, a retest of the $97–$100 resistance zone is likely; a break below $78 risks a drop toward $68.\n\n\nTrading suggestions lean toward a **range‑based approach** in the immediate term. Conservative traders can consider scaling into long positions near established support, targeting the $82–$88 zone with tight risk management under $75. More aggressive players might watch for a clear break above the 20‑period SMA with increased volume to signal a momentum shift, as a sustained move could open space for higher targets. Conversely, weakness below support may favor short setups, keeping a close stop just above local resistance to limit drawdowns."

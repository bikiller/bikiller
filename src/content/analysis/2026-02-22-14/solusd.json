Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action in the short term reflects a cautious market bias, with the latest print at **83.6 USD** and a modest **24‑hour decline of −0.43%**. After testing the intraday range between **84.05 and 83.38**, price momentum shows frictions near key moving averages. The **20‑period SMA at 85.07** remains slightly overhead, acting as dynamic resistance and signaling that bearish pressure still outweighs bullish follow‑through. Until Solana decisively reclaims this average, trend bias leans neutral‑to‑slightly bearish on lower timeframes.\n\nMomentum indicators point toward weakening bullish conviction. The **MACD reading of −0.2157** (with signal pending) suggests that the recent bullish thrust has lost steam, with histogram contraction likely if momentum continues to slide. In the absence of a reliable **RSI(14)**, traders should infer from price behavior around support levels: lack of acceleration near the 20‑SMA and tightening range suggests consolidation rather than trend extension. A break below the short‑term swing lows would confirm a deeper correction phase.\n\nKey technical zones to watch are around **78.50–80.00 USD** as near‑term support, grounded in recent demand confluence and prior price rejections. A sustained break below this band could open room toward the **75.00 area**, where longer‑term buyers may step in. On the upside, reclaiming and holding above **85.50–86.00 USD** would be the first sign that bulls are regaining control, with a secondary hurdle near **90.00 USD**, a psychological level and prior resistance.\n\nIn terms of actionable suggestions, cautious traders might consider range‑based tactics while volatility remains subdued: buying nearer support with tight stops, and light profit‑taking near the 20‑SMA or defined resistance zones. Breakout traders should wait for confirmed closes beyond these levels to manage risk more effectively, as false moves are common in congested patterns."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nBinance Coin’s recent price action suggests a cautiously bearish tone in the short term. After testing the intra‑day high near 626.66 and pulling back to 621.52, BNB is trading below its 20‑period simple moving average at 638.50, indicating short‑term downward pressure. The inability to sustain rallies above the SMA suggests sellers are still defending higher price levels. Unless buyers regain control above 638–640, the trend remains skewed to the downside.\n\nLooking at momentum, the available MACD reading of –4.52 (with the signal line not currently provided) points to bearish momentum persisting. Though the absence of the signal line and RSI limits confidence in overbought/oversold readings, the negative MACD implies that recent price declines have not yet reversed. Traders might watch for a MACD crossover toward the upside as an early sign of shifting momentum, but at present the indicator leans toward caution for longs.\n\nKey technical levels to monitor include immediate support around the recent low of 621.50, followed by a psychological zone near 600. Breaking below 600 could open the door to deeper retracement toward 580–560. On the upside, resistance clusters around the 20‑period SMA near 638, reinforced by the 650 area where previous swings stalled. A decisive move above 650–660 would be required to validate a short‑term trend change and invite fresh buying interest.\n\nFor traders, a measured approach is advisable. Short‑term traders might consider scaling into long positions only on clear bullish confirmation, such as strong closes above 638 with expanding volume or a positive MACD crossover. Conservative participants could wait for price to reclaim 650 before committing to upside positions. Meanwhile, shorts targeting pullbacks could use resistance zones near 638–650 as logical entry points, with protective stops above recent highs to manage risk."

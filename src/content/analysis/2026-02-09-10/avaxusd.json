Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche (AVAX) is showing a short-term bearish trend as price sits below the 20-period simple moving average at **9.07**, indicating sellers maintain control. Price attempted to rally toward the **9.20–9.30** zone but failed to sustain upside momentum, settling near the current **8.81** level. The slight negative 24-hour change and compressed high/low range suggest indecision, but the failure to reclaim the SMA signals continued downward pressure in the immediate term.\n\nMomentum indicators are subdued. The MACD value at **–0.0646** without an available signal line suggests fading bullish thrust and a tilt toward bearish momentum. The absence of an RSI reading limits overbought/oversold context, but price action below the short-term average typically aligns with weaker market sentiment. Traders should watch for any MACD histogram convergence or divergence as an early sign of shifting momentum, though for now the session reflects a lack of conviction among buyers.\n\nKey technical levels are clear: immediate support resides at **8.70–8.75**, where recent lows clustered, and a break below could expose deeper support near **8.40–8.50**. On the upside, resistance remains at the 20-SMA, with stronger barriers at **9.20** and **9.50**, the latter representing a more significant rejection zone from prior sessions. Sustained trading above **9.20** would be needed to suggest a short-term trend reversal and recovery toward the **9.50–9.80** range.\n\nFor traders, the suggestion is to remain cautious and consider short positions on clear rebounds off resistance with tight risk management. Conservative entries might await a break and retest of the **support zone around 8.70**, with stop-losses just below **8.60**. Aggressive traders could look for bullish divergence or a reclaiming of the **9.07 SMA** as a signal to scale into long positions with targets near resistance."

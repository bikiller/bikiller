Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSOL/USD is showing **a cautious but constructive trend** near the $89.5 area after testing a recent high of ~$90.1. Price action over the past 24 hours has been mildly bearish, with lower highs and a modest pullback from resistance. However, the fact that price has stayed above the 20‑period SMA suggests near‑term strength is intact unless $88 breaks decisively.\n\nLooking at momentum, the MACD reading of **1.0686** indicates bullish underlying pressure, though the absence of a signal line makes crossover interpretation limited. The positive MACD suggests buyers are not out of the market yet, but waning upside pace could signal consolidation. The RSI being unavailable adds uncertainty around overbought/oversold extremes, so watching how momentum evolves in the next sessions will be key to gauging strength.\n\nNear‑term support lies around **$88.5–$88.0**, anchored by the 20‑period SMA and recent swing lows. A close below $88 could open the door to a deeper retracement toward $86.50, where stronger bids may emerge. On the upside, initial resistance appears at **$90.50–$91.00**, zones where supply has previously reasserted itself. A sustained push above this level would add credibility to a bullish continuation.\n\nFor traders, a balanced approach makes sense given the current setup. Aggressive bulls might look for long entries on dips toward $88 with tight stops under $87.75, targeting $91 and above. More conservative traders could wait for a decisive break and daily close above $90.50 before adding new longs. Conversely, a break and close below $88 might tilt sentiment toward short‑term sellers with targets near $86.50, keeping risk management front and center."

The market has been consolidating in a range roughly between **~80–90 USD**, showing indecision rather than sustained directional conviction. Sellers appear to have the upper hand around recent highs (around the mid‑to‑high 80s), and the inability to hold above the 20‑period SMA (currently ~85.7) hints that short‑term momentum is softening even as price hovers near equilibrium. Recent on‑chain flow and range dynamics also reinforce this chop rather than a clean breakout. \n\n**Indicator interpretation** under current data paints a mixed but cautious picture. MACD remains negative, suggesting that momentum is tilted toward the downside, yet without an active signal line reading to confirm a definitive trend shift. The lack of a visible RSI reading today limits directapped between $78 and $89.\n\n\n**Indicator interpretation** under current data paints a mixed but cautious picture. MACD remains negative, suggesting that momentum is tilted toward the downside, yet without an active signal line reading to confirm a definitive trend shift. The lack of a visible RSI reading today limits direct momentum insight, but broader readings from other sources suggest RSI in lower ranges on daily timeframes, pointing to modest bearish bias or neutral pressure rather than a strong oversold bounce. The 20‑period SMA acting above price reinforces sellers’ edge, while the MACD’s negative drift hints at lingering selling pressure that traders should not ignore. \n\nKey **del Flags Solana as Deeply Undervalued at $87: SOL Price Analysis](https://www.livebitcoinnews.com/new-model-flags-solana-as-deeply-undervalued-at-87-sol-price-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *livebitcoinnews.com* · 2026/2/10\n> Solana trades 44.6% below fair value according to power-law model analysis, as technical indicators show oversold conditions.\n\n\nKey **support levels** to watch are near the $84–$81 zone, with secondary floors evident slightly lower toward ~$80 if volatility increases. On the upside, **near‑term resistance** sits around $87.9–$89.3, with a clean breakout above this range needed to shift sentiment more bullishly. Breaking above the 20‑period SMA with volume could signal a short squeeze towardhose resistance points. Failure to hold current floors might accelerate declines toward deeper support around $80 and below, especially if broader risk assets weaken. \n\nFrom a **trading perspective**, cautious participants might prefer range‑based strategies while the market remains in consolidation. Long entries nearer support with tight stops under $80 could favor a lowiew of SOL's fundamental and technical analysis data.\n\n\nFrom a **trading perspective**, cautious participants might prefer range‑based strategies while the market remains in consolidation. Long entries nearer support with tight stops under $80 could favor a low‑risk bounce play, while breakout traders might wait for a decisive close above the mid‑to‑high $80s to validate upside continuation. On the flip side, a break below support with growing MACD drift could open a low‑probability short setup, though risk management is key given crypto’s volatility and false breakout potential."

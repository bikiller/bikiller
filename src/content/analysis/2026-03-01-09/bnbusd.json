The latest price near 620.69, hugging the 20‑period simple moving average at 617.93, suggests equilibrium between buyers and sellers. Short‑term momentum lacks conviction above recent highs (~623.35), but also resists deeper pullbacks above the 618 support zone. This consolidation hints that a breakout—either direction—may materialize once volatility expands.\n\nThe **MACD reading of 4.16339**, while positive, cannot be fully contextualized without a signal line, yet it indicates that recent shorter‑term averages are above longer averages, reflecting underlying bullish pressure. The absence of RSI data limits direct overbought/oversold assessment; however, price action stuck near the moving average and tight highs/lows implies reduced volatility and potential accumulation. Traders should watch for MACD divergence or cross confirmations to validate entries.\n\n**Key technical zones to watch**: initial support sits around 618–619, reinforced by the 20‑SMA zone (~617.9). A deeper retracement toward 610 may attract stronger bids if accompanied by increasing volume. On the upside, the immediate resistance cluster near 623–625 represents the first hurdle; a clear break above 630 could unlock further upside toward 640–650. Conversely, a close below 612 may expose the 600 psychological level.\n\nGiven the current structure, a **range‑oriented strategy** suits short‑term traders, balancing risk with tight stops around support. More aggressive participants could consider long exposure on confirmed rejections at support with targets near recent highs. For trend followers, waiting for a sustained break above 630 with volume validation could define a stronger uptrend continuation. Always align position sizing and risk tolerance with your broader portfolio strategy."

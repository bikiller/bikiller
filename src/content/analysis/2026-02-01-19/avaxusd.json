Price action has been confined between the recent high near $10.09 and intraday lows near $9.90, suggesting consolidation rather than a decisive directional move. A break above $10.10 could signal renewed bullish pressure, whereas failure to sustain above the 20‑period SMA underscores short-term sellers’ presence.\n\nFrom an indicator standpoint, the absence of a current RSI reading makes it difficult to gauge overbought or oversold conditions, but the MACD reading at -0.1095 highlights prevailing bearish momentum. The MACD below zero implies sellers still hold an edge, though a potential convergence toward its signal line could indicate slowing downside pressure. The SMA(20) at 10.0960 is acting as dynamic resistance, reinforcing the importance of overcoming this moving average to shift sentiment.\n\nKey support is visible around the $9.90–$9.85 zone, a level that has consistently attracted buyers in recent sessions. A stronger cushion may lie at $9.70, where historical reaction suggests increased demand. On the upside, immediate resistance stands at $10.10, with stronger hurdles clustered between $10.25 and $10.40. Traders should monitor volume confirming any breakout or breakdown, as thin liquidity around these levels could amplify whipsaws.\n\nGiven the muted momentum, range‑oriented strategies are preferable near current levels. Scalp long entries near support with tight stops can capture small intraday rebounds, while breakout traders should await clear closes above $10.10 for long exposures. Conversely, a decisive move below $9.85 would favor short setups targeting lower support, always mindful of risk management against abrupt reversals."

The pair is trading below its **20‑period simple moving average (~85.59)**, suggesting mild bearish bias and overhead resistance near that average. On a broader scale, there’s evidence of a sideways to slightly bearish trend unless buyers reclaim higher moving averages. Traders looking at macro structure should note prior swing highs and lows to position entries and exits accordingly. \n\nMomentum indicators provide mixed signals. Your MACD sits slightly positive at **0.0749**, hinting at some bullish momentum, yet the lack of a corresponding signal line reading limits confidence in a clean bullishD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more.\n\n\nMomentum indicators provide mixed signals. Your MACD sits slightly positive at **0.0749**, hinting at some bullish momentum, yet the lack of a corresponding signal line reading limits confidence in a clean bullish crossover. Typical RSI data isn’t available here, but external technical summaries often pointard neutral to slightly oversold conditions in broader timeframes when RSI hovers around key mid‑range levels. This blend suggests indecision, requiring confirmation from price action above resistance or below support. \n\nKey levels to watch: immediate support lies around **$80–$82**, with stronger psychological floors nearer **$75–$78** where market participants have historically stepped in. Resistance clusters begin at the current SMA area and extend higher toward. While short-term indicators show potential weakness, there may be opportunities for recovery in the medium term, contingent on broader market conditions and Solana's ability to maintain support levels. Updated 346 minutes ago.\n\n\nKey levels to watch: immediate support lies around **$80–$82**, with stronger psychological floors nearer **$75–$78** where market participants have historically stepped in. Resistance clusters begin at the current SMA area and extend higher toward recent swing highs around **$90–$95**, the latter representing a pivot where upside momentum typically accelerates if breached. Holding above support zones while breaking resistance could shift the trend toward bullish. \n\nFor traders, the current environment favors range‑responsive strategies. On dips toward support, selective long positions with tight stops may capture bounce potential but manage risk due to volatility. Breakouts above the **20‑period SMA** with increased volume could justify momentum buys targeting higher resistances range‑responsive strategies. On dips toward support, selective long positions with tight stops may capture bounce potential but manage risk due to volatility. Breakouts above the **20‑period SMA** with increased volume could justify momentum buys targeting higher resistance. Conversely, failure to hold lower supports might see accelerated selling, where short positions or protective hedges become prudent. Stay disciplined with risk controls and watch for clear confirmation of trend shifts. \n> **[Solana (SOL) Technical Analysis - CoinLore](https://www.coinlore.com/coin/solana/technical-analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *CoinLore* · 2026/2/16\n> Technical analysis for Solana SOL including RSI, MACD, moving averages EMA and SMA, historical volatility, bollinger bands and more."

The gap below the **20‑period SMA at ~9.17** indicates that sellers still have the upper hand in the very short term, and the inability to reclaim that average convincingly points to a lack of strong upward momentum. In trend terms, AVAX is grinding sideways with bearish undertones until it can clear this dynamic resistance with conviction.\n\nThe MACD reading being positive (0.0588) hints at emerging momentum, but without the signal line and clear crossover confirmation, this is more of a tentative setup than a confirmed trend shift. A positive MACD above zero often suggests buyer interest building, but the lack of a robust RSI reading to confirm strength means traders should be cautious of false breakouts. In this context, you’d want to see MACD accelerate with increasing histogram bars or a clear cross above signal to support long entries in tandem with rising volume.\n\nKey psychological and technical levels cluster around **$8.90–$9.00 as near‑term support** and **$9.17–$9.30 as the immediate area of resistance**, defined by recent moving average pressure and price interaction. A decisive break below **$8.90** could open the door toward lower support zones seen historically closer to the next significant demand area, while a breach above **$9.30–$9.50** might invite bullish traders back in with targets toward **$10.00+**. These levels help frame where buyers and sellers are likely to react.\n\nIn terms of execution, a neutral stance with an eye on volatility contraction is appropriate here. Consider entering long only once AVAX closes above the **20‑period SMA** on strong volume and MACD shows a confirmed bullish crossover. For shorts, look for rejection off **$9.30** with tightened stops above that zone. Always weight your entries with risk management, because the broader trend remains unclear until more decisive price structure confirms direction. \n> **[How to interpret MACD and RSI signals for AVAX trading?](https://www.gate.com/crypto-wiki/article/how-to-interpret-macd-and-rsi-signals-for-avax-trading?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *gate.com* · 2025/11/6\n> The article provides a detailed analysis of Avalanche (AVAX) through technical indicators such as MACD, RSI, and moving averages.

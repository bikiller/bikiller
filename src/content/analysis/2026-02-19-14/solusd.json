The MACD reading around **‑0.67** underscores **bearish momentum**, even though absence of the signal line limits direct crossover signals. Without a bullish MACD crossover, downside pressure could persist before any meaningful lift takes hold. The missing RSI data makes it harder to pinpoint overbought or oversold thresholds, but broader market readings on longer timeframes have previously shown neutral to slightly negative tendencies, suggesting price could hesitate until momentum shows clearer support. \n\nKey support and resistance levels help frame risk. Immediate intraday support lies near **$78.50–79.00**, with a break below this potentially exposing deeper SOL forecast as well as a Solana technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nKey support and resistance levels help frame risk.

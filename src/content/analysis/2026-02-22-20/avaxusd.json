Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAVAX is showing a **short-term bearish tilt** as price sits below the 20‑period simple moving average at 8.950, reflecting recent downside pressure. The latest price around **8.81** is contained in a tight range, indicating low volatility and potential consolidation. If the market breaks decisively below the **8.75–8.70 support zone**, sellers could accelerate toward lower levels. Conversely, reclaiming the SMA could signal steadier buying interest returning.\n\nMomentum indicators suggest weakness but lack full clarity. With MACD negative (-0.0833) and its signal line unavailable, the bearish momentum is visible but not confirmed by a crossover signal yet. The absence of a valid RSI reading means we can’t gauge overbought/oversold conditions, so use caution when interpreting momentum. Still, the negative MACD hints that sellers have modest control and rebounds may be limited without stronger bullish catalysts.\n\nKey supports sit near **8.70 and 8.50**, drawn from recent pivot lows and psychological levels, where buyers previously entered. Resistance emerges at **8.95–9.00**, aligned with the SMA and recent swing highs, and further at **9.10–9.20** if upside picks up. Market structure suggests a range‑bound phase until a clear breakout above resistance or breakdown below support. Watching how price reacts to these levels will help confirm the next directional move.\n\nFor traders, a cautious approach suits current conditions. Range strategies like **buying near support with tight stops** and booking partial profits near resistance could work in low‑volatility action. Breakout traders might wait for a close above **9.00** for a long bias or a break under **8.70** to consider short positions. Always manage risk with appropriate position sizing and stop losses, as surprise volatility can emerge."

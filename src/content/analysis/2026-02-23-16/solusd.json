Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s price action around **$79.06** reflects a slightly **bearish short-term bias** following a minor pullback. After failing to convincingly break and hold above the **20‑period simple moving average (~$79.88)**, price retreated within a tight $78.63–$79.79 range. This sideways volatility underscores indecision among traders, with sellers nudging control but not triggering a larger breakdown yet. Watch how candles interact with SMA(20) for early clues of directional bias.\n\nWithout a current RSI value, momentum readings are incomplete, but the **MACD’s negative histogram (-0.865)** suggests downward momentum persists. A declining MACD typically signals that short-term price strength is waning relative to longer averages, even if signal lines aren’t available. Price failing to gain traction above recent highs reinforces this nuance. Traders should treat current momentum as cautious, not aggressively bearish, since the market hasn’t confirmed a strong directional thrust.\n\nKey structural levels to monitor: the **$78.50–$78.60** zone acts as immediate support, with a break below possibly accelerating selling toward **$75.00**. On the upside, reclaiming and closing above **$80.50–$81.00** could set up a test of **$83.00**, where prior supply has emerged. These horizontal levels matter because Solana has oscillated in this band repeatedly; a breakout or breakdown with volume would improve conviction in either scenario.\n\nIn terms of trading suggestions, disciplined participants might prefer range‑based tactics while volatility remains muted. Buying nearer support with tight stops beneath $78.50 and targeting $80.50–$81.00 could be efficient for shorter swings. Conversely, more directional plays might require waiting for a breakout beyond these thresholds on strong volume, reducing whipsaw risk. Risk management remains essential given the current lack of clear trend dominance."

With the recent 24‑hour move nearly flat, momentum appears subdued and the market lacks directional conviction. Broader technical services show mixed sentiment in the mid‑term, with some oscillators leaning neutral and trend indicators not decisively bullish. \n\nThe MACD reading at **‑0.4176** underlines the current **bearish momentum**, reflecting that sellers still exert pressure.

Without a positive signal line or clear RSI (unavailable), it’s prudent to interpret the momentum as weak rather than strongly oversold. The inability to sustain above the 20‑SMA and stagnant RSI range in other live charts suggest that the market could continue to test lower levels before meaningful strength emerges. \n\nFrom a **support and resistance** perspective, **$125–127** serves as immediate support, a zone where recent buying interest surfacedpt.com)** · *TradingView*\n> Which technical analysis tools can be used to analyze Solana?

Overhead resistance sits near the **$128–$130** band defined by moving averages and short‑term pivots, with more substantial resistance around **$140+** found in multi‑period technical studies. A clean break above the 20‑day SMA could open momentum toward the next resistance. \n\nFor **trading suggestions**, cautious traders might favor a range‑play approach: consider building small positions near confirmed support and trim into strength near key resistance, tightening risk with stops under **$120** to limit downside. Shorter‑term breakout strategies could become viable if price convincingly clears **$130–132**, signaling a shift in momentum.

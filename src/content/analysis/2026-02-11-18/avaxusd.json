The recent 24‑hour price action shows a tight range and minor negative change, indicating indecision among participants. Without a clear RSI reading yet, this lack of strong momentum keeps the trend in a sideways to slightly bearish phase, with bulls needing a reclaim above 8.65–8.70 to assert strength.\n\nLooking at traditional support and resistance context, key psychological support sits near **8.50–8.55**, where recent lows have clustered, and a break below that zone could invite sellers toward **8.30–8.20**. Immediate resistance resides just above the current range around **8.65–8.75**, with a more substantial barrier near **9.00** where broader moving averages converge. In longer timeframes, historical swing zones nearer $10 and above remain major hurdles as trading interest gravitates toward higher‑value levels seen in prior cycles. \n\nThe MACD reading in negative territory suggests recent downward momentum has outpaced upside pressure,ncies/avalanche/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *coinmarketcap.com*\n> The live Avalanche price today is $8.72 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $210,171,756.95 USD. We update our AVAX to USD price in real-time.\n\n\nThe MACD reading in negative territory suggests recent downward momentum has outpaced upside pressure, even if signal lines aren’t fully clear yet. This points to weak bullish conviction right now. Traders should watch for MACD histogram contraction or a potential crossover to cue momentum shifts. If the price consolidates above SMA20 with shrinking volatility and MACD stabilizing, it could set up a short‑term bullish reversal. Conversely, expanding downside momentum below support could accelerate losses.tion is warranted until clearer oscillator signals confirm direction.\n\nFor practical trading, consider entering long positions only on a confirmed break and retest of **8.75–9.00** with volume support, setting stops just below **8.50**. Shorter trades could target resistance near 9.00 with tight risk control. If bearish momentum strengthens under **8.50**, shorts or protective hedges might look to targets around **8.20–8.00**, but always manage risk in this volatile market environment."

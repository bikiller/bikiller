      "content": "当前XRP/USD价格处于1.85附近，近期24小时内下跌1.72%，显示市场情绪略显疲弱。从技术面来看，短期走势处于震荡区间，价格在1.85至1.89区间内波动，未能突破关键的阻力位。若价格持续未能突破上方1.90的SMA(20)位置，短期内可能会继续震荡整理。\n\n当前未提供RSI和MACD的完整信息，但根据现有数据，XRP/USD的负MACD值（-0.00915）表明市场短期内可能处于空头主导的状态。MACD线低于信号线，进一步验证了市场的下行压力。同时，价格接近1.85的低点，若未能守住这一支撑位，可能会加剧下行风险。\n\n在支撑方面，1.85是目前的关键支撑位。如果价格下破此位置，则可能会加速下探至1.80区域。上方1.89-1.90为近期的阻力位，若突破这一区域，可能迎来反弹行情。关注突破或回落信号，尤其是在1.85和1.90之间的关键区间。\n\n综合来看，短期内XRP/USD面临较强震荡，建议交易者保持观望，除非出现明确的突破信号。若价格回落至1.85以下，可以考虑短期做空；反之，突破1.90可考虑小幅做多。"

The snapshot — with the latest price at *1.85482* and a **24‑hour loss around 1.7%** — reflects mild bearish pressure, showing sellers have the edge near current levels. Broader trend context suggests the market is below the **20‑period SMA (~1.900)**, indicating short‑term downtrend bias unless buyers reclaim this average. \n> **[Latest XRP (XRP) Price Analysis - CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/cmc-ai/xrp/price-analysis/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *coinmarketcap.com* · 2026/1/23\n> Discover the latest XRP (XRP) price analysis including why the price has moved today.

The **MACD is negative** (‑0.0091) without a signal line crossover yet, pointing to bearish momentum persisting and little conviction in bullish reversal. Typically a rising MACD crossing above its signal line signals a shift to bullish momentum; here, the absence of that flip suggests sellers remain in control. The RSI isn’t provided, but broader indicator datasets often show XRP’s RSI lingering in neutralslightly oversold territory, so shallow bounces may have limited follow‑through. \n\nKey technical levels to watch are clustered around psychological and historical pivot points. Immediate **support** sits near today’s low around *1.85–1.80*, with a stronger cushion historically around **$1.70–$1.75** — a zone where longer‑term buyers have stepped in previously.technical levels to watch are clustered around psychological and historical pivot points. Immediate **support** sits near today’s low around *1.85–1.80*, with a stronger cushion historically around **$1.70–$1.75** — a zone where longer‑term buyers have stepped in previously. On the upside, the near‑term **resistance** zone runs from the SMA at **$1.90** up toward **$2.00**; a clear break and hold above there would be needed to suggest regime change and open the door to **$2.10+** levels.

If price drops below *$1.80* convincingly, short‑term traders may consider defensive short positions with tight risk management. Alternatively, a break above **$1.90–$2.00** on strong volume could justify a scaling‑in strategy targeting rebound momentum, keeping stops just below breakdown levels to manage downside.

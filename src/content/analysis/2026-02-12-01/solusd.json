Yesterday’s range (High: 80.73, Low: 79.93) shows buyers defending the $79.90 zone, keeping price above the **20‑period simple moving average (SMA)** at 80.17. While the advance is gradual, the setup suggests a consolidation phase rather than a sharp reversal or breakdown. Trend integrity hinges on maintaining momentum above the 20‑SMA; a sustained break below would open the door to deeper pullbacks.\n\nThe absence of a current RSI reading limits momentum clarity, but the **MACD’s negative value (-0.8176)** still warrants attention. A negative MACD implies bearish undertones persist, even as price holds near resistance. Without a corresponding signal line or histogram, assume momentum remains tepid rather than decisively bullish. If MACD can move toward a crossover above an emerging signal, it would strengthen bullish conviction. Until then, the mixed indicator picture supports a cautious approach.\n\nKey **support** levels to watch include the intraday low near **$79.90** and a more meaningful zone around **$78.50–$78.80**, where recent buyers previously stepped in. On the upside, initial **resistance** sits at **$81.00–$81.50**, with a more structural barrier near **$83.00–$83.50**. A daily close above $81.50 would suggest renewed upside interest, likely drawing in short‑term breakout traders. Conversely, failure to hold the near‑term support zone might accelerate selling pressure toward the mid‑$70s.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑based strategy** makes sense under current conditions: consider long entries near support with tight stops (below $79.50), targeting the $81–$83 area. Breakout traders could watch for a decisive move above $81.50 on volume to confirm continuation. Risk‑averse participants might wait for clearer MACD confirmation or a resolved RSI reading before scaling in. Always size exposure in line with risk tolerance, given the current consolidation and mixed signals."

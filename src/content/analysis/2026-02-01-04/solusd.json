The narrow 24‑hour range (high $104.90 / low $104.71) shows traders are indecisive, and the slight negative change indicates sellers and buyers are in a tug‑of‑war. The short‑term trend leans mildly bearish since prices are below the **20‑period simple moving average (SMA 20 at $107.41)**, which often signals resistance overhead and a lack of bullish conviction.\n\nWith the MACD currently at **‑2.84086** and no visible signal line crossover, Solana’s momentum appears weak and slightly tilted toward the downside. A negative MACD typically reflects that the shorter‑term moving average is below the longer‑term, reinforcing downward pressure. Without RSI data, we can’t confirm oversold or overbought conditions, but the price behavior near key levels suggests traders are cautious. Keep an eye out for an MACD histogram shift toward zero — it could hint at early strength returning.\n\nKey support sits near the recent swing lows around **$102–$103**, where buyers previously stepped in. If that zone breaks decisively on strong volume, Solana could test lower support near the psychological **$100** mark. On the upside, **$107.40** (SMA 20) and the recent high near **$110–$112** act as resistance. A convincing break above these levels would be needed to reclaim short‑term bullish structure and attract momentum buyers.\n\nFor traders, a range‑oriented strategy makes sense given the current lack of a clear trend. Consider long entries near **$102–$103** with tight risk control, and look for breaks above **$108** for trend‑following setups. Avoid aggressive entries mid‑range; confirmation from volume expansion or indicator improvements (e.g., MACD crossing toward positive) will improve trade quality and reduce whipsaw risk."

The 24‑hour range between **$77.49 and $79.11** shows relatively narrow movement, indicating hesitation among buyers and sellers. On a slightly higher timeframe, the absence of clear directional momentum suggests a consolidation phase rather than a strong uptrend or downtrend. Until there’s a decisive break above recent swing highs or below recent lows, the bias remains neutral to mildly bullish.\n\nLooking at the available indicators, the **20‑period simple moving average (SMA) at ~82.16** sits above the current price, signaling short‑term bearish pressure. With the price below this key average, momentum favors sellers in the near term. The **MACD histogram reading of -3.61**, without a confirmed signal line crossover, reflects ongoing bearish momentum, though it’s not extreme enough to signal capitulation. In this context, bulls will want to see a MACD turnaround and a move back above the SMA to regain confidence.\n\nIn terms of key levels, immediate **support lies near $77.50**, which has acted as a short‑term floor in the past sessions. Below that, psychological support around **$75.00** could attract renewed buying interest. On the upside, the first meaningful resistance zone sits between **$82.00 and $83.00**, where the SMA and recent highs converge. A break above this area would be the first sign that buyers are stepping in with conviction and could open the door toward $85 and beyond.\n\nFor traders, a cautious approach is prudent. Range traders might look to buy near $77.50 with tight stops, targeting the $81–$82 range. Trend traders could wait for a confirmed break above the SMA and psychological resistance for a clearer long entry. Conversely, a drop below $77 could present a short opportunity, aiming for the $75 region, always mindful of overall market volatility."

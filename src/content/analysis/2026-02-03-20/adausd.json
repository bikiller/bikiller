      "title": "Cardano vs US Dollar Technical Analysis",
      "content": "Cardano is trading slightly above its short-term average, with price hovering near 0.297 after a modest 24-hour gain. The structure suggests a short-term consolidation phase rather than a decisive trend, as higher lows are forming while upside momentum remains muted. Holding above the 20-period simple moving average indicates mild bullish pressure, but the narrow intraday range shows that buyers are still cautious at current levels.\n\nMomentum indicators provide mixed signals. The MACD remains marginally negative, implying that bearish momentum has not fully dissipated, though the small magnitude hints at weakening downside pressure. The absence of a confirmed RSI reading limits overbought or oversold assessment, reinforcing the idea of a neutral momentum environment. Overall, indicators suggest the market is stabilizing, waiting for a catalyst to confirm either continuation higher or a renewed pullback.\n\nFrom a price-structure perspective, immediate support sits near the recent low around 0.291, which has acted as a short-term demand zone. A deeper support area may emerge near the 0.285 region if selling pressure increases. On the upside, resistance is clustered between 0.298 and the psychological 0.300 level, followed by a higher barrier near 0.305, where sellers are likely to become more active.\n\nTrading approaches should reflect the current range-bound conditions. Short-term traders may look for bounce setups near the 0.291 support with tight risk management, targeting the 0.298–0.300 zone. Break-and-hold acceptance above 0.300 could open the door to a momentum-based long toward higher resistance. Conversely, failure to maintain above the 20-day average would favor cautious positioning or short-term defensive strategies."

The slight 24-hour gain and consolidation near the 20-period SMA (currently ~10.04) suggest prices are hovering around a near-term equilibrium. However, broader trend context from recent market structures points to **lower highs and lower lows**, indicating persistent bearish pressure unless key resistance is reclaimed. Recent higher timeframe analyses show sellers retaining control and corrective rallies getting sold into. \n\nLooking atche Faces Bearish Setup Below $10 Despite ETF and RWA Adoption Boom](https://blockonomi.com/avalanche-faces-bearish-setup-below-10-despite-etf-and-rwa-adoption-boom/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *blockonomi.com* · 2026/2/1\n> Avalanche price remains weak despite ETF inflows and rising RWA TVL, with traders eyeing lower liquidity zones below key support levels.\n\n\nLooking at indicators, the MACD’s negative reading reflects weakening momentum, with the signal line unavailable but expected to remain above the MACD in a bearish regime. The absence of a reliable RSI reading prevents a clear overbought/oversold signature, the price fluctuating around the SMA without strong divergence hints at a lack of directional conviction. If the price fails to decisively climb above the SMA and nearby levels, continuation of range-bound or downward action is plausible. \n\nKey technical levels to watch for AVAX/USD are near **resistance around $10.50–$11.28**, where sellers could reassert, and **support near $9.50–$9.85** on the downside.

On the flip side, slipping below the lower support could accelerate losses toward deeper liquidity areas, historically pegged far below current levels during strong bearish phases. \n\nFor traders, a **neutral-to-cautious approach** makes sense in this environment.

      "content": "当前雪崩币（AVAX/USD）价格处于8.99附近，较前24小时微幅上涨0.38%。从技术图形来看，价格近期表现出震荡整理的趋势，未能有效突破9.20上方的阻力位，短期内仍可能维持横盘整理或小幅下行。若价格突破8.95支撑位，可能进一步跌向8.80附近。\n\nRSI（14）目前无法提供数据，无法从超买或超卖角度判断市场情绪。然而，MACD处于负值区间，且未出现明显的交叉信号，暗示市场仍处于弱势状态。短期内，价格若未能有效反弹至SMA(20)的9.24附近，则可能持续受到卖压影响。\n\n支撑位方面，8.95为关键支撑区域，若跌破此位，可能会加剧下行趋势，进一步寻找8.80附近的支撑。阻力位则集中在9.20一线，若突破此位，将打开上行空间，挑战9.40或更高水平。当前市场情绪仍较为谨慎，需关注短期波动。\n\n建议交易者在价格接近支撑位时考虑低位吸纳，而在接近阻力位时考虑做空或减仓。谨慎操作，严格设置止损，避免大幅回撤风险。"

Although there was a small uptick in the latest 24‑hour data, overall momentum remains subdued and price is below the 20‑period simple moving average (~$9.24), signaling that short‑term bias favors the downside unless buyers can reclaim above this average. Broader weekly charts show AVAX lagging major market peers with a negative drift over recent weeks. \n\nLooking at indicators, MACD sits in negative territory, reflecting bearish momentum still presentlanche/usd?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *coingecko.com*\n> The daily exchange rate of Avalanche (AVAX) to USD fluctuated between a high of $9.33 on Thursday and a low of $8.29 on Wednesday in the last 7 days. Within the week, the price of AVAX in USD had the largest 24-hour price movement on Thursday (0 days ago) by $0.699245 (8.1%). Compare the daily prices of Avalanche (AVAX) in USD and their 24-hour price movements for the week.\n\n\nLooking at indicators, MACD sits in negative territory, reflecting bearish momentum still present despite a slight price uptick; absence of a reported Signal line here suggests caution in interpreting any immediate cross. Typically, a MACD below zero implies sellers have been dominant, and only a push above zero (or a positive histogram expansion) would confirm a shift toward bulls. The RSI not being available here means’d want to monitor it on your chart, but external sources point to historically weak oscillator readings during downtrends. \n\nKey **support levels** to watch are around **$8.0–$8.3** (recent lows) and psychological lows near **$7.5–$7.7**, where buyers previously stepped in slightly. If those break, the next deeper siding likely lies closer to $7.0 or below, given extended bearish structure. Resistance is immediate at the SMA(20) near $9.24 with a more meaningful barrier around **$10.0–$10.5t lows) and psychological lows near **$7.5–$7.7**, where buyers previously stepped in slightly. If those break, the next deeper siding likely lies closer to $7.0 or below, given extended bearish structure. Resistance is immediate at the SMA(20) near $9.24 with a more meaningful barrier around **$10.0–$10.5**, where upside pressure has repeatedly stalled. A clear break above $10 can open the door toward $11–$12 in a corrective bounce. \n\nFor traders, a cautious approach suits current conditions: **range‑bound play** between support and resistance could work well with tight stops, or waiting for **confirmation above the $9.2–$9.3 zone** before scaling longs. Short bias may be favored if price convincingly closes below $8.0 on higher volume. For swing setups, consider partial entries near support with clear stop‑etween support and resistance could work well with tight stops, or waiting for **confirmation above the $9.2–$9.3 zone** before scaling longs. Short bias may be favored if price convincingly closes below $8.0 on higher volume. For swing setups, consider partial entries near support with clear stop‑loss under $7.7, and profit targets near the nearby resistance zone, adjusting exposure as broader market sentiment shifts."

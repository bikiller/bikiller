Price has been trading below the 20‑period SMA at ~1.3829, suggesting that immediate momentum is slightly weak. Broader trading profiles from technical platforms often skew neutral to slightly bearish on moving averages and indicator mixes, hinting that sellers still exert pressure even as bulls defend lower levels. \n\nIndicator interpretation adds nuance.

In addition to technical analysis, it's always best to use as much data as possible — to stay on top of everything that can potentially influence XRP price, keep an eye on related news.\n\n\nIndicator interpretation adds nuance. While you provided MACD slightly positive (0.0077), absent a signal line reading, this hints at tentative momentum but lacks conviction. External data often show MACD trending marginally bearish on longer frames, reflecting cooling momentum. A missing RSI reading for your dataset limits precise overbought/oversold cues, yet third‑party summaries often put daily RSI below neutral, indicating modest bearish bias without extreme exhaustion. \n\nKey levels to watch include support near **$1.32tps://www.investing.com/crypto/xrp/technical?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *investing.com*\n> Detailed XRP forecast as well as a XRP technical analysis through moving averages, buy/sell signals, and common chart indicators.\n\n\nKey levels to watch include support near **$1.32–$1.29**, with stronger floors like **$1.24** often referenced on pivot‑based analyses. Resistance clusters appear around **$1.40, $1.45, and $1.49**, with immediate hurdles just above the 20‑SMA zone. A break above **$1.40** opens the next leg toward the upper resistance band, while failure to hold near current support could accelerate downside toward the lower anchors. \n\nTrading suggestions hinge on risk tolerance.

For range traders, a push toward **$1.40–$1.45** can offer short entries if volume falters, with tight stops above those zones. Alternatively, a break below **$1.32** could invite continuation shorts, targeting the **$1.29** base with stops just above current consolidation. Longer‑term players mayfer confirmation above **$1.50** before scaling in, as that level often signals broader trend repair. Always pair these ideas with volume confirmation and broader market cues before execution."

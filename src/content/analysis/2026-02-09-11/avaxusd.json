Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nAvalanche’s price action around **$8.78** shows a market that’s struggling to maintain bullish momentum. The recent 24‑hour price change of **+0.15%** and tight high/low range suggest indecision between buyers and sellers. With the **20‑period simple moving average (SMA) at ~9.05**, the current price sits below this key level, indicating short‑term bearish bias. Until price convincingly reclaims the SMA, the trend can be considered neutral to slightly negative.\n\nLooking at momentum tools, incomplete data like missing RSI and MACD signal limits confidence, but the available **MACD at –0.0805** implies underlying bearish pressure. A negative MACD typically points to weakening buying interest and potential continuation of downward moves unless reversal signals emerge. Traders should watch for a completed bullish crossover (MACD rising above its signal line) or improving RSI above 50 before assuming strength. Absence of these confirmations suggests patience is warranted.\n\nIn terms of **support and resistance**, immediate support is around **$8.50–8.60**, where recent buyers have emerged. A break below this area could open the door toward stronger support near **$8.00**, a psychologically important level. On the upside, the 20‑period SMA near **$9.05** and the recent high around **$9.20–9.30** act as resistance zones. A sustained move above these levels would be needed to shift sentiment positively and encourage larger positions.\n\nFor **trading suggestions**, conservative traders might wait for a defined breakout above the moving average and key resistance before entering long. More aggressive traders could consider scaled entries near established support, using tight stop‑losses to manage risk. Given the current data limitations, emphasizing risk control and waiting for clearer signals before committing significant capital is a prudent approach."

The market appears to lack directional conviction, as the price languishes below the **20‑period simple moving average (~637.24)**, hinting that recent short‑term momentum is bearish relative to its recent average. This situational price behavior suggests that **the trend is weakly bearish to neutral**, with sellers still exerting enough influence to keep prices beneath a key dynamic average.  \n\nThe **MACD reading at −5.31** without an available signal line currently points toward lingering negative momentum, implying that downward pressure still dominates the oscillator’s framework even as the market tries to stabilize. The absence of a reported RSI leaves a gap in momentum analysis, but the fact that price is under its 20‑day mean suggests traders shouldn’t expect strong bullish momentum until a clear recovery is seen above that level. In such scenarios, confirmation from a rising RSI above neutral ~50 and a bullish MACD crossover would be desirable before assuming trend reversal. \n\nKey **support levels** to watch in the near term lie around **610–615**, where buyers may step in to defend against further declines, and below that the psychological **600 zone** often plays a role in attracting demand. On the upside, **resistance sits near the 20‑period SMA (~637)**, with stronger congestion likely between **650–660** to watch in the near term lie around **610–615**, where buyers may step in to defend against further declines, and below that the psychological **600 zone** often plays a role in attracting demand. On the upside, **resistance sits near the 20‑period SMA (~637)**, with stronger congestion likely between **650–660** based on recent trading activity. Breaks above these resistance ranges with volume could signal the start of a corrective upswing rather than just a short‑lived bounce. \n\nFrom a **trading suggestion** perspective, risk‑averse traders might prefer to wait for a decisive reclaim of the 20‑period average before adding fresh long positions, or look for a bounce off support in the lower **610s** with tight stop‑loss orders. Shorter‑term sellers could consider downside plays if price decisively closes belowrspective, risk‑averse traders might prefer to wait for a decisive reclaim of the 20‑period average before adding fresh long positions, or look for a bounce off support in the lower **610s** with tight stop‑loss orders. Shorter‑term sellers could consider downside plays if price decisively closes below key support levels, targeting lower bands while managing risk. Using confirmations such as price action patterns or an improving MACD histogram can help reduce false signals in this choppy environment."

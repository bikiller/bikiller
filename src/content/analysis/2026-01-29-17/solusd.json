Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nSolana’s short‑term price behavior around **$117.69** suggests mild bearish pressure after failing to sustain a move above recent highs near **$119.80**. The slight 24‑hour decline (~‑0.9%) reflects sellers stepping in around resistance, while the low at **$117.53** shows short‑term support holding for now. Trend analysis leans neutral to slightly bearish as price remains beneath the **20‑period SMA (~122.52)**, indicating the near‑term bias is under pressure rather than trending upward.\n\nWith the **MACD** in negative territory (‑1.714) and no signal line available, momentum clearly lacks strength on the upside. The absence of a usable RSI value makes it harder to gauge overbought or oversold conditions, but the divergence between price and the declining SMA hints at weakening buyer conviction. Traders should watch for a potential MACD flattening or crossover as an early sign of a shift toward bullish momentum.\n\nKey technical levels to monitor include **support near $115.00**, a round number that has acted as a psychological floor previously, and a stronger zone near **$110.00**, which could absorb selling if bears intensify. On the upside, reclaiming **$120.00** with conviction would signal renewed interest from buyers, while breaking above the **20‑period SMA** could open the door toward **$125–128**. Failure to hold $115 might accelerate stop‑loss triggers and extend selling pressure toward lower supports.\n\nIn terms of trading suggestions, cautious traders might wait for a confirmed breakout above $120 with volume before initiating long positions, aiming for measured targets while respecting risk. Shorter‑term traders could consider scalp longs near support bands with tight stops below $115, or look for brief pullbacks to resistance if momentum strengthens. Given current indicators, risk management should be a priority as the trend lacks clear bullish confirmation."

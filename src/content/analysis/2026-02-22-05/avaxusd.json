      "title": "Avalanche vs US Dollar Technical Analysis",
      "content": "Avalanche (AVAX) is currently facing a slight decline, trading at $9.0261, which marks a decrease of -0.20% over the past 24 hours. The price has seen limited movement, with the high and low values sitting at $9.046 and $9.026, respectively. This suggests a narrow range and a consolidating market. At this point, AVAX appears to be in a neutral-to-bearish short-term trend, with no significant volatility to suggest a major breakout. The market may be awaiting fresh catalysts for direction.\n\nThe absence of an RSI (14) and the current MACD value of -0.0377 indicates a lack of strong momentum. A negative MACD suggests that bearish sentiment could be present, though with no signal line available, confirming whether this will persist or reverse is difficult. Without the support of other indicators, the price action alone cannot clearly determine a bullish or bearish bias. In this environment, traders should wait for confirmation from other technical signals before making decisive moves.\n\nLooking at the SMA (20), which stands at 9.18887, the current price is trading below this level, confirming that the short-term trend is downward. A break below the recent low of $9.026 would likely lead to further bearish momentum, with the next support area coming around $8.90 or even $8.80. Resistance appears near the $9.15 mark, slightly above the current SMA, and a breakout above this level could point to potential gains back toward the $9.20–$9.25 range.\n\nFor trading strategies, a cautious approach is recommended. Traders might consider entering short positions if the price fails to reclaim the SMA and continues to trend lower, especially if further confirmation comes from a continuation of the negative MACD. Conversely, a rally above the $9.15 resistance could signal a potential long entry, with stops placed below the $9.00 support level. Monitoring for any breakouts or reversals will be key to timing entries effectively."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nThe AVAX/USD pair is showing **sideways consolidation near the $12.00 zone**, reflecting a market that’s digesting recent moves with low volatility. Over the last 24 hours, price has barely budged, holding between **$11.92 and $11.96**, which suggests indecision among traders at current levels. While not a strong directional signal, this tight range often acts as a precursor to a breakout — either above local resistance or below key support zones. Watching for volume expansion will help confirm any decisive movement.\n\nTechnical indicators are currently muted but still informative. The **SMA(20) at ~12.05** sits just above the current price, indicating short-term bearish pressure and a potential cap on upward momentum. The MACD being negative (‑0.0449) further supports mild bearish undertones, though the absence of a signal line value limits the strength of that interpretation. Without a reliable RSI value, infer momentum cautiously: the pair is not oversold or overbought, pointing toward neutral dynamics and a lack of strong trend conviction at present.\n\nOn the charts, immediate **support** appears around **$11.90–$11.85**, reflecting recent lows where buyers have stepped in. A breakdown below this zone could lead to a slide toward the next psychological support near **$11.50**, where broader market interest may re-emerge. **Resistance** sits primarily at the **20‑period SMA near $12.05**, with a secondary hurdle at **$12.20–$12.30** — the latter area being a short-term ceiling in recent sessions. A sustained break above $12.30 could signal renewed bullish energy and a test of higher levels.\n\nFor traders, a **range‑based strategy** makes sense until volatility returns. Consider long entries on dips toward $11.85 with tight stops below structure, targeting the $12.05–$12.30 band. Conversely, nimble shorts may be appropriate near the upper resistance, especially if rejection patterns form. Longer‑term players should wait for a clear break and retest of key levels before committing significant capital, as current data point to consolidation rather than trend acceleration."

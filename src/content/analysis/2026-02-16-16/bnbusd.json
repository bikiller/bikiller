The fact that BNB is below its **20‑period simple moving average (~$615)** points to a lack of upward conviction in the immediate term, hinting at lingering bearish bias unless bulls reclaim this average decisively. Recent broader technical summaries also tilt toward bearish signals on daily indicators, reinforcing the cautious tone. \n\nMomentum indicators you provided—negative **MACD** and absent RSI—underline weakening trend strength. A negative MACD normally signals that shorter-term averages are below longer-term ones, implying downwards momentum pressure. When used alongside the SMA context, this alignment often suggests the current move lacksum indicators you provided—negative **MACD** and absent RSI—underline weakening trend strength. A negative MACD normally signals that shorter-term averages are below longer-term ones, implying downwards momentum pressure. When used alongside the SMA context, this alignment often suggests the current move lacks sustained bullish momentum and could see further corrective action before any robust uptrend resumes. \n\nOn support and resistance, traders might look at **support near $600** as the first key level holding recent price action, with a deeper floor closer to **$580–$590** in the event of extended selling. Above,e action, with a deeper floor closer to **$580–$590** in the event of extended selling. Above, resistance clustering around the **$615–$620** zone remains meaningful, and a break through **$625–$630** could unlock more upside. Higher time frame resistances (not shown here) remain above the current range, suggesting any trend shift needs clear higher highs first. \n\nForows Resilience at $600 as RWA Expansion Strengthens](https://www.cryptonewsz.com/bnb-600-as-rwa-expansion-strengthens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)** · *cryptonewsz.com* · 2026/2/13\n> The BNB price is likely to hold $600 support amid intact demand pressure and substantial growth in its RWAs services.\n\n\nFor trading strategies, consider that in range conditions, a conservative approach could be to fade moves toward resistance and accumulate nearer structural support with tight risk control. Breakout traders might watch for a decisive move above the 20‑period average and subsequent resistance levels before targeting larger long positions. Conversely, a breakdown below $600 might open short‑termortunities, but risk management should be tight given typical crypto volatility."

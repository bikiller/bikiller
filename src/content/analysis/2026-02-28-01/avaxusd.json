The latest quotations near **8.93** suggest sellers retain slight control, with the SMA(20) at **9.04** acting as immediate dynamic resistance. Price failing to reclaim that average consistently increases the probability of a continuation toward lower intra‑day zones. Trend structure remains cautiously sideways to down until a breakout above the mid‑term average.\n\nMomentum indicators hint at subdued bearish pressure. The MACD’s negative reading around **‑0.0907** suggests that downward momentum is modest but present, though absence of a signal line limits clarity. Without a clear RSI reading, it’s prudent to weigh current momentum with caution. Traders should observe whether the MACD histogram contracts toward zero, which could precede a reversal. Persistent negative readings alongside price below the SMA often reflect distribution rather than accumulation.\n\nKey horizontal levels emerge from recent price swings. Immediate resistance is near **9.10–9.20**, where prior rejections clustered and the SMA converges. If price convincingly clears and holds above this region, buyers may target **9.50–9.70**, with failure there likely to reassert sellers. On the downside, the **8.70–8.80** area represents initial support, followed by secondary support near **8.50**; a break below this could accelerate selling toward lower levels.\n\nFor active traders, consider maintaining a wait‑and‑see approach until clearer directional cues appear. Range‑oriented strategies could work between support and resistance mentioned, with tight stops to manage risk. More aggressive entries favor reclaiming the 20‑period moving average confirmed by strengthening MACD momentum. Longer‑term holders might use dips toward support for staged accumulation, but should define risk tolerances clearly."

Start immediately with the content (no title needed)\\n\\nBegin:\")\n\nCurrent price action for SOL/USD around **116.86** reflects a fairly neutral intraday bias, with the pair retracing only marginally from the **117.80** high. The short-term trend oscillates near the 20‑period simple moving average at **115.94**, indicating a balance between buyers and sellers. While there isn’t a decisive uptrend, the market is not sharply bearish, suggesting consolidation rather than sustained directional momentum. Watching for a breakout above recent highs could signal renewed strength.\n\nThe lack of a published RSI value complicates the momentum picture, but MACD’s negative reading of **‑0.36** hints at mild bearish pressure in the short term. With the signal line not available, we can infer that momentum has softened, yet hasn’t shown explosive downside. Traders should be cautious, since MACD below zero can accompany range‑bound price action before a more pronounced move materializes. Confirmation from volume or complementary indicators would help reduce uncertainty.\n\nKey psychological support sits near the recent swing low around **116.65**, with further cushion near the 20‑SMA. A drop below these levels could open the door toward **114.00–112.50** support zones. On the upside, breaking above **117.80** and then **120.00** would confirm bullish intent and could attract short‑term buyers targeting **123.50**. Monitoring the strength of bounces off support will be important; weak recoveries may invite further selling pressure.\n\nFor traders, a prudent approach is to wait for confirmation beyond these tight ranges before committing significant capital. Aggressive traders might consider long entries only on sustained closes above **118.00** with defined stops below **116.50**. Conservative participants could opt for range trading between **115.50–118.00**, capturing small moves while protecting against breakout risk in either direction."

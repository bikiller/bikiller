Over the last 24 hours, the modest positive change suggests buyers are maintaining control, albeit without strong conviction. The price hugging near the recent intraday high ($9.2427) points to a short-term uptrend, but the narrow range between the daily high and low ($9.1924) reflects low volatility and market indecision. Until a breakout occurs, expect slow, choppy movement.\n\nThe **20-period Simple Moving Average (SMA)** at $9.1598 is currently acting as near-term support, with price comfortably above it. This underpins the slight bullish sentiment and could attract short-term buyers looking for pullbacks toward the SMA. The **MACD reading of 0.0738**—positive—indicates momentum remains on the upside, but without the signal line available, its strength is harder to quantify. If the MACD histogram expands further above zero, bullish continuation becomes more plausible.\n\nKey **support levels** to watch are around **$9.10–$9.15**, the zone of the 20-SMA and recent intraday lows. A decisive break below this area might shift sentiment toward bears, inviting deeper correction toward $8.90 and $8.70 levels. On the upside, **$9.40–$9.50** presents immediate resistance, with buyers needing to clear this cluster to challenge the next psychological barrier near **$10.00**. Watch for volume spikes near these levels to confirm breakouts.\n\nIn terms of **trading suggestions**, a cautious long bias could be appropriate on dips toward $9.15–$9.10, with tight risk management and stop-losses just below $9.00. More aggressive traders might consider scaling in on a confirmed break above $9.40 with increasing volume. Conversely, short positions may only make sense if price convincingly drops below the $9.10 support zone, targeting lower support and managing risk around recent lows."
